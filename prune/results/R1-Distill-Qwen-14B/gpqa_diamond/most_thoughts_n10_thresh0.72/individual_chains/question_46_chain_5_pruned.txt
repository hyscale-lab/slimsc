Okay, so Iâ€™ve got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but let me think. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, right? Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, kind of swapping the ends. So Grubbs would catalyze this process.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent means five carbons. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons correctly.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl group on carbon 3. So, the structure should be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, that can't be right because five carbons. Let me structure this properly.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the five carbons are arranged as follows: 1 (start), 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. Then the methyl group is on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's six carbons? No, wait, no. Wait, pent has five. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2= 
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: C(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, that would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)CH2CH3. So it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that's probably CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? Hmm, maybe I should write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, 3-methyl pent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)2. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me count the carbons again.

Wait, another approach. The formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would give six carbons if I count that. Wait, no, that's five: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). Wait
