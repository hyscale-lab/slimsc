Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh wait, I think it's written as L = -λ ψ_f (some terms) ψ_f. So perhaps the interaction term is something like λ ψ_f X ψ_f, which would imply that the boson X is coupling to fermions. Since it's a Yukawa-type interaction, right? Because Yukawa interactions are typically of the form g ψ ψ X.

So in Yukawa theory, the coupling is between a fermion and a scalar (boson) field. So each fermion ψ_f would have a term like λ X ψ_f^† ψ_f, which would mediate interactions where the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find all the possible fermion pairs that the X boson can decay into, considering their masses.

Wait, but wait: the decay X → f f̄ requires that the energy of X is at least twice the rest mass of the fermion f. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, the mass of the parent must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of each child (if they're the same, like fermion and antifermion). So the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Let me list the known fermion masses. Well, the charged leptons are electrons, muons, taus. Their masses are approximately:

- electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- tau (τ): ~1777 MeV (about 1.777 GeV)

The quarks are a bit trickier because they're confined, but their masses are:

- up (u): around 2-5 MeV (but current algebra gives a lower value, maybe 1.5-3 MeV)
- down (d): similar to u, around 3-6 MeV
- strange (s): ~95-105 MeV
- charm (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- top (t): way heavier, around 172 GeV

Wait, but wait—when considering whether a fermion pair can be produced, the masses I should use are the current quark masses or the constituent quark masses? Hmm, because the constituent mass is higher due to binding energy and such, but for
