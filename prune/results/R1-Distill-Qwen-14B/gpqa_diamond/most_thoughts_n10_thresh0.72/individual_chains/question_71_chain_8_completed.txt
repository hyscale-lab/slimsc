Okay, so I need to figure out the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that shouldn't affect the ratio. The key here is that they're using the TTV method, but I think that's more about how they were discovered, not the temperatures. Since they're in orbital resonance with each other and have circular orbits, their orbital periods are in a specific ratio.

The orbital periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planets 1 to 5. So, Planet_1 has a period of P, Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P.

Equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, right? The formula I remember is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since albedos are the same for all planets, that part cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of temperatures will depend on the square root of the inverse of their orbital distances.

But wait, how does the orbital period relate to the distance? Oh, right, Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). So, P² ∝ a³. Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, if I want to find the ratio of their distances, I can take each planet's period to the power of 2/3. Let's define Planet_2's period as P2 = 2P, and Planet_4's period as P4 = 3.5P.

So a is proportional to (P)^(2/3). Therefore, a2 is proportional to (2P)^(2/3), and a4 is proportional to (3.5P)^(2/3).

To find the ratio a4/a2, that would be (3.5P / 2P)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3).

Simplify 3.5/2: 3.5 is 7/2, so 7/2 divided by 2 is 7/4. So 7/4 is 1.75.

So the ratio a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). Hmm, what's 1.75 to the power of 2/3? Let me think.

Alternatively, I can compute it as (7/4)^(2/3). Let's calculate the natural log first. ln(7/4) is ln(1.75)= approx 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596*(2/3) ≈ 0.373. Then exponentiate e^0.373 ≈ 1.453. So a4 is about 1.453 times a2.

Wait, but the temperature ratio is T4/T2. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)} ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Since same albedo, the ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( a2/(a4) ) because when you take the ratio, the other terms cancel. So wait, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Oh right, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). Because if a4 is larger, T4 is smaller. So the ratio would be sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ).

Since a4/a2 is about 1.453, then a2/a4 is 1/1.453 ≈ 0.688. Then sqrt(0.688) is about 0.829, which is approximately 0.83. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Alternatively, let's compute more accurately.

Let me compute (3.5)/(2) = 1.75. So (1.75)^(2/3).

We can write 1.75 as 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3) = (7^(2/3)) / (4^(2/3)).

7^(1/3) is approximately 1.913, so squared is about 3.66. 4^(1/3) is about 1.587, squared is about 2.5198.

So 3.66 / 2.5198 ≈ 1.453. So a4 is 1.453*a2.

So T4 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a4)), T2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)).

So T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt(1/1.453) ≈ sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829.

That's about 0.83, which is option C.

Wait a second, but let me check the math again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of their distances from the star. Since the formula for equilibrium temperature is T ∝ (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. But since L and σ are constants, the ratio T4/T2 would be (a2/a4)^(1/2).

Wait no, wait. Let me re-derive.

The equilibrium temperature equation is:

T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π ε a² σ) ]^(1/4 )

So T ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) = (1/a)^(0.5) = 1/sqrt(a).

So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4 )^(1/2 )

Wait, no, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) ?

Wait, no, wait. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 = T0 / sqrt(a4), T2 = T0 / sqrt(a2). So T4 / T2 = (sqrt(a2) ) / sqrt(a4) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

Which is the same as what I had before.

So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( 1/(a4/a2) ) = 1 / sqrt( a4/a2 )

Which is 1/sqrt(1.453) ≈ 1/1.205 ≈ 0.829, so 0.83. So option C is correct.


To determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the fact that equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are given as \( P_1: P_2: P_3: P_4: P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), the orbital distance \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \).

For Planet_2, \( P_2 = 2P \), so \( a_2 \propto (2P)^{2/3} \). For Planet_4, \( P_4 = 3.5P \), so \( a_4 \propto (3.5P)^{2/3} \). The ratio of their distances is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

Calculating \( 1.75^{2/3} \), we find \( 1.75^{1/3} \approx 1.205 \), so \( 1.75^{2/3} \approx 1.205^2 \approx 1.453 \). Thus, \( a_4 \approx 1.453 \cdot a_2 \).

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( T_4 / T_2 \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance ratio:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.453}} \approx \sqrt{0.688} \approx 0.829.
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.83 \), which corresponds to option C.
