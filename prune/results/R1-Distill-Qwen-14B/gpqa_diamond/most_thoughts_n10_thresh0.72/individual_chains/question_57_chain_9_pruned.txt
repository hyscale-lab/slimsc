Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ₀ = 90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, but the note says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess I don't need to consider any beyond δ₄. The incident electrons have an energy of 50 MeV, and I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude? I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the general formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ a_l (something with spherical harmonics?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for each partial wave, the amplitude has a contribution. Since we're looking for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which would be when θ=0°, I think.

Wait, along the incident beam direction, that's θ=0. So the scattering is either forward or perhaps something else. Let me think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be written as a sum over l of (2l + 1) [something] times the spherical harmonics. But when considering the direction along the beam (θ=0), the angular part might simplify.

Alternatively
