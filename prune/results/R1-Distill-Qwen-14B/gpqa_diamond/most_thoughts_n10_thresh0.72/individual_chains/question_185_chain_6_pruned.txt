Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector and n is a unit vector.

Wait, Pauli matrices... right, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli spin matrices. Each is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product σ · n would be the sum of the components of σ multiplied by the components of n. So if n is (n_x, n_y, n_z), then σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

Oh, right, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian and traceless. So H is a 2x2 matrix because σ is, and multiplied by ε, which is an energy constant. Since n is a unit vector, the direction doesn't matter, just the magnitude maybe.

Wait, eigenvalues of such a Hamiltonian. Since H is a 2x2 matrix, it'll have two eigenvalues. I remember that for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix, like H, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0.

But wait, another approach. I think the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. For example, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Similarly for σ_y and σ_z. So if I have σ · n, which is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, what are its eigenvalues?

Wait, the eigenvalues of σ · n. Since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is just a spin operator in the direction of n. So, for any spin-1/2 particle, the spin component in any direction has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, the Hamiltonian here is given as H = ε (σ · n). So if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1/2 (since σ matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but wait no, that's not right. Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by ħ/2, they give the spin operators, which have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli
