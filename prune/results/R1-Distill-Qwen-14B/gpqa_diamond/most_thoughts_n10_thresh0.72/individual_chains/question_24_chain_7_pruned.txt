Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about mixtures X and Y, and some reactions involving them. The key seems to be understanding the reactions and figuring out the structures of the compounds involved.

First, let's try to parse the information given.

Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, if a liquid can decolorize bromine water, that usually suggests that it has unsaturated bonds, like double or triple bonds, which can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So, the two liquids in X probably have double bonds or triple bonds.

When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction that leads to mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two other liquids. This reaction is a disproportionation. Disproportionation usually involves a single substance being both oxidized and reduced. So, maybe one of the components in X is undergoing a redox reaction, splitting into two different products with different oxidation states.

Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that the products in Y don't have the same kind of unsaturated bonds as X. Since X's reaction with Pt leads to Y, which doesn't react with bromine, perhaps the double bonds in X are being hydrogenated or something similar.

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance, Z, a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%, and it's a constituent of Y. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it probably doesn't have any unsaturated bonds left.

Moreover, Z is a solvent widely used, so I'm thinking of something like hexane or another alkane. But let's calculate the hydrogen percentage.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me think, the formula for mass percentage is (mass of H / molar mass) * 100%. Let's assume Z is CnH2n+2 (since it's a hydrocarbon and probably an alkane, as it doesn't react with H2 anymore). So, for an alkane, the formula is CnH2n+2.

The molecular mass would be (12n) + (2n+2) * 1 =14n +2. The mass of H is 2n+2 grams per mole, so the percentage is [(2n+2)/(14n+2)] *100% =14.28%.

Let me solve for n.

(2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by (14n +2):

2n + 2 = 0.1428*(14n +2)

Calculate 0.1428 *14n = 2n, and 0.1428*2≈0.2856.

So,

2n +2 = (2n) + 0.2856

Wait, subtract 2n from both sides:

2 = 0.2856

That can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let's compute 0.1428*(14n +2):

0.1428 *14n = 2n (because 14 *0.1428 is approximately 2). Similarly, 0.1428 *2 is about 0.2856.

So,

2n +2 = 2n + 0.2856

Subtract 2n from both sides:

2 = 0.2856 → which is impossible. So, that suggests I must have done something wrong. Maybe the assumption about Z being an alkane is incorrect, or perhaps the formula I used is wrong.

Wait another thought: perhaps Z is a cyclic compound, like cyclohexane, but that's still an alkane. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the percentage.

Wait, 14.28% is approximately 1/7. Because 14.28 is roughly 100/7, which is about 14.2857%. So 14.28% is 1/7. So (2n + 2)/(14n +2) = 1/7.

Let me write that equation:

(2n +2)/(14n +2) = 1/7

Cross-multiplying:

7*(2n +2) = 14n +2

14n +14 =14n +2

Subtract 14n from both sides:

14=2 → which is impossible again. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula for the molecular mass. Let me think again.

The formula for the alkane is CnH2n+2.

So, molecular mass is 12n + (2n +2) =14n +2.

Hydrogen's contribution is (2n+2)*1 g/mol.

So (2n+2)/(14n+2) = 1/7.

Wait, 1/7 is approximately 0.1428, which matches the given percentage. So,

(2n+2) = (14n +2) /7

Multiply both sides by 7:

7*(2n +2) =14n +2

14n +14 =14n +2

Again, 14 =2, which is impossible. So maybe I messed up the formula of Z.

Wait another possibility: perhaps Z is an alkene or alkyne, but it doesn't react with H2 anymore. So, maybe it's a fully hydrogenated product, but that doesn't make sense because alkenes would react.

Wait, no, Z is the product of hydrogenation of both X and Y, and it doesn't react further. So Z must be a fully saturated compound, probably an alkane.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula. Maybe Z is a cycloalkane? For example, cyclopropane, cyclobutane, etc. Let's check.

Wait, let's think alternatively. Maybe the molecular formula is different.

Let me think, maybe Z is a benzene derivative? But no, hydrogenation of benzene would give cyclohexane, but benzene is not a constituent of Y. Alternatively, maybe Z is toluene, but that doesn't fit the description.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the reactions.

Mixture X is two liquids that decolorize bromine. So maybe they are alkenes or alkynes (but more likely alkenes). When they are treated with Pt and heated, they undergo a reaction to form Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. The reaction is a disproportionation. Hmm, for a single substance to undergo disproportionation, but X is a mixture of two.

Wait, perhaps the two components of X are the same compound in different forms, like cis and trans isomers, but that may not make sense. Or perhaps the two are in a way that when they react, they form Y as a different mixture.

Wait, but the reaction is a disproportionation, which implies that one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So maybe X is a single compound, but
