Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), which I assume is a two-component vector. 

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩. In this case, the operator is S_y. Oh wait, but wait, I think S_y is related to the Pauli matrix sigma_y. Right, the Pauli matrices are used in spin operators. The spin operator S is ħ/2 multiplied by the Pauli matrix. So, S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

What's sigma_y? Oh right, sigma_y is the matrix:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) times that matrix. Got it. 

Now, the state vector is given as (3i, 4). Wait, that's a column vector, right? So the state ψ is |ψ> = [3i; 4]. But I should verify if this vector is normalized. To do that, I need to compute its inner product with itself. The inner product is (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4). Let's compute that: (3i)(-3i) is (9*(-i^2)), and since i^2 is -1, this becomes 9*(1)=9. Then 4 times 4 is 16. So 9 +16=25. The norm is sqrt(25)=5. So the state isn't normalized; it has a magnitude of 5. But maybe I don't need to normalize it for the expectation value calculation because the formula takes care of it.

Wait, no. The expectation value formula requires the state to be normalized. Because the expectation value is the probability amplitude, which is a probability, so it should sum to one. Wait, or is that not necessarily the case? No, I think the expectation value is ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ only if the state isn't normalized. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

The expectation value is ⟨Ô⟩ = (ψ† Ô ψ) / (ψ† ψ)
