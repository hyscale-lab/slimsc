Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the comoving distance of a quasar. Hmm, I remember that comoving distance is a way to measure distance in an expanding universe, right? The question gives some cosmological parameters: Hubble constant (H0) is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter Ωm is 0.3, dark energy Ωλ is 0.7, and the universe is flat. So the question is about what the comoving distance (at scale factor a=1) would be for this quasar.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what scale factor a=1 means. Oh right, the scale factor a is 1 at the present time. So the comoving distance from Earth to the quasar is what we're looking for.

The question mentions observations in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops for wavelengths shorter than that. I think that peak is related to the Lyman-alpha emission line, which for hydrogen is around 121.6 nm in the rest frame. But wait, 790 nm is longer, so maybe this is a redshifted emission line.

So let me think: if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, and the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm, then the redshift z would be (observed - rest)/rest. Let me calculate that: (790 - 121.6)/121.6 = (668.4)/121.6 ≈ 5.5. So z is approximately 5.5.

Wait, but wait—could it be another line? The Lyman break is at 912 angstroms (which is 91.2 nm, so about 91 nm), so a peak beyond that would imply the quasar's spectrum is redshifted beyond the Lyman limit. So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is much longer, that would suggest a high redshift.

So redshift z is about 5.5. Now, I need to find the comoving distance as a function of redshift for these cosmological parameters.

Comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ*(1+z)^3(1-3(1+z)^-1)) ). Wait, no, actually, I think E(z) is sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωr*(1+z)^4 + Ωλ). Since Ωr is negligible here, and Ωm + Ωλ = 1 (since flat), we can ignore radiation.

So E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ). For z=5.5, we can approximate E(z) as sqrt(0.3*(1+5.
