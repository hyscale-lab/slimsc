Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending up with product 4. I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. 

First, I'll go through each reaction step by step to understand what's happening.

The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine. I remember that cyclohexanone has a ketone group. When you add bromine to a ketone, it usually undergoes a bromination, but wait, I think that might be a different context. Oh wait, noâ€”bromine addition to a ketone. Oh, right! I think this is about the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group. Oh wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. So, adding bromine could be a bromination via some mechanism. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation, but wait, no, bromine in a different solvent. Oh wait, maybe it's an addition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromine acting as an electrophile in a nucleophilic attack. Wait, no, ketones are not nucleophilic. Hmm. Oh wait, I remember that when ketones are treated with bromine (Br2) in a specific solvent, like maybe in a basic condition, it forms a bromohydrin. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, I think that adding Br2 to a ketone can lead to the formation of a dibromide if the conditions are such. Or maybe it's a dienophile? No, wait. Let me think again. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine, which is a dienophile, but wait, cyclohexanone is just a single carbonyl. So perhaps the bromine adds across the carbonyl group. Wait, but adding Br2 to a carbonyl would form a bromide. So, cyclohexanone plus Br2 would add Br across the carbonyl, turning it into a geminal dibromide. So product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or wait, wait, when you add Br2 to a ketone, the result is a vicinal dihalide? Or is it a geminal dihalide? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall:
