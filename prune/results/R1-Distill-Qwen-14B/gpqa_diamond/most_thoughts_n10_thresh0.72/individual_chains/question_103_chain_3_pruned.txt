Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about choosing the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think.

First, I should figure out the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So that's a ketone group attached to a benzene ring which has bromine and nitro groups at specific positions.

Let me draw this structure. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is bromo, and position 5 is nitro. Wait, wait, benzene is symmetric, so position 3 and 5 might be adjacent if we're numbering correctly. Wait, no, in benzene, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So if the substituents are at 3 and 5, that might be meta to each other. Let me see. Benzene is a six-membered ring. So 1, 2, 3 are in a row. 3 and 5 would be two positions apart. So if substituents are at 3 and 5, that would be meta positions. So the ring has a nitro group at position 5 and bromine at 3. And then, attached to the benzene ring is a ketone group (ethan-1-one), which is a carbonyl group. So the ketone is at position 1, because when the substituents are at 3 and 5, maybe the ketone is at position 1? Or perhaps waitâ€”no, wait. The substituents are in the ring, and the ketone is attached as a side chain. So the structure is benzene with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and a ketone group attached at position 1. So the ring has three substituents: the ketone, Br, and NO2.

Wait, but the formula is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So that's ethan-1-one meaning that the carbonyl is at the end of a two-carbon chain. So the structure is (Phenyl group with substituents at 3 and 5) connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is then attached to a methyl group (since ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-).

Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. Because ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-, right? So the structure is:

     O
     ||
CH3-C-O-Benzene

But wait, the benzene ring is substituted with Br and NO2. So the benzene ring has substituents in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone attachment. So the ketone is attached at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is like this: the ketone is at position 1, so the benzene ring would have substituents at positions 3
