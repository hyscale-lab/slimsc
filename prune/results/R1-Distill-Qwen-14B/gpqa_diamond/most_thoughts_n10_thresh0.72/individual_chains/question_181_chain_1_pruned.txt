Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let's try to work through it step by step. So the question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III branch stops in the Sun's core.

Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton chain. There are different branches of the proton-proton (pp) reactions. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each of these contributes differently to the neutrino flux.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? I think pp-III is one of the later steps in the proton-proton chain. Oh right, the pp-I chain produces helium-4, and then there's the CNO cycle which is another fusion pathway. The pp-III branch might involve some triple-alpha reactions or maybe something else. Or wait, maybe pp-III is a branch where two protons combine with a helium-3 nucleus, leading to more helium-4 and a positron. And in that process, neutrinos are emitted.

Wait, no, I'm confusing things. The pp-III branch probably involves the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons to form a helium-5 nucleus, which quickly decays into helium-4, a positron, and a neutrino. So the neutrinos from this process are the ones we're talking about here.

So if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? Well, the pp-III branch is one of the sources of high-energy neutrinos, I think. Like, the neutrinos from this process have higher energies compared to the ones from the other branches.

Wait, but neutrinos' energies are generally determined by the reaction that produces them. For example, in the pp-I branch, we have the reaction where a proton captures a proton to form a deuteron, which then captures another proton to form helium-3, and so on, leading to the production of neutrinos when the boron-8 decays. Those are the lower-energy neutrinos, like the 7 Be ones, which have lower energies, around a few MeV maybe. Whereas the pp-III branch, which produces neutrinos via the helium-3 plus two protons process, maybe those neutrinos are higher in energy.

Wait, but the question is about the flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower energy than band 2.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of higher energy neutrinos would decrease. Because the pp-III neutrinos probably are in the higher energy range, perhaps band 2. So if that stops, the flux in band 2 would decrease more than in band 1.

But wait, are the neutrinos from each branch in different energy ranges? Let me think. I think the neutrinos from the pp-I branch (like the boron-8 decay) have lower energies, say around 1.4 MeV. The pp-III branch's neutrinos are higher. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (like those in band 2, 800-900 keV) would stop coming. But wait

Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and neutrinos are a byproduct of these reactions. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I think the proton-proton chain has different branches. The main pp-I branch is the dominant one, which produces helium. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III which are less significant, perhaps involving more protons and maybe boron or something. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form carbon-12 or something like that. So if the pp-III stops, those reactions no longer contribute.

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the proton-proton chain, particularly in the pp-I branch where a boron-8 is formed, which then decays into helium-4 and emits a neutrino. But wait, I think the pp-III branch might produce higher-energy neutrinos compared to the pp-I. Because in pp-I, the neutrino energy is relatively lower, around a few MeV, maybe 1-10 MeV. The pp-III reactions, perhaps they emit higher-energy neutrinos because the involved particles have higher masses or the reactions are more energetic.

So the question is about the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). These are both in the MeV range, but band 2 is slightly higher. If the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux in these bands?

I think the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in higher energy ranges. So if it stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like those in band 2) would drop. But the lower band (700-800) might still get some contribution from the pp-I branch, assuming that's the main source.

Wait, but the question says the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos take about 8 minutes to travel from the Sun's core to Earth (since the Sun is about 8 light minutes away), that means the neutrinos we detect now are from the Sun's core as it was 8.5 minutes ago. So if
