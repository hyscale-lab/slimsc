Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and neutrinos are a byproduct of these reactions. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I think the proton-proton chain has different branches. The main pp-I branch is the dominant one, which produces helium. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III which are less significant, perhaps involving more protons and maybe boron or something. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form carbon-12 or something like that. So if the pp-III stops, those reactions no longer contribute.

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the proton-proton chain, particularly in the pp-I branch where a boron-8 is formed, which then decays into helium-4 and emits a neutrino. But wait, I think the pp-III branch might produce higher-energy neutrinos compared to the pp-I. Because in pp-I, the neutrino energy is relatively lower, around a few MeV, maybe 1-10 MeV. The pp-III reactions, perhaps they emit higher-energy neutrinos because the involved particles have higher masses or the reactions are more energetic.

So the question is about the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). These are both in the MeV range, but band 2 is slightly higher. If the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux in these bands?

I think the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in higher energy ranges. So if it stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like those in band 2) would drop. But the lower band (700-800) might still get some contribution from the pp-I branch, assuming that's the main source.

Wait, but the question says the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos take about 8 minutes to travel from the Sun's core to Earth (since the Sun is about 8 light minutes away), that means the neutrinos we detect now are from the Sun's core as it was 8.5 minutes ago. So if
