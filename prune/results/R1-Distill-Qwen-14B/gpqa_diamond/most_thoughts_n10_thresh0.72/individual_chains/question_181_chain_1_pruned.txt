Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let's try to work through it step by step. So the question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III branch stops in the Sun's core.

Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton chain. There are different branches of the proton-proton (pp) reactions. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each of these contributes differently to the neutrino flux.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? I think pp-III is one of the later steps in the proton-proton chain. Oh right, the pp-I chain produces helium-4, and then there's the CNO cycle which is another fusion pathway. The pp-III branch might involve some triple-alpha reactions or maybe something else. Or wait, maybe pp-III is a branch where two protons combine with a helium-3 nucleus, leading to more helium-4 and a positron. And in that process, neutrinos are emitted.

Wait, no, I'm confusing things. The pp-III branch probably involves the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons to form a helium-5 nucleus, which quickly decays into helium-4, a positron, and a neutrino. So the neutrinos from this process are the ones we're talking about here.

So if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? Well, the pp-III branch is one of the sources of high-energy neutrinos, I think. Like, the neutrinos from this process have higher energies compared to the ones from the other branches.

Wait, but neutrinos' energies are generally determined by the reaction that produces them. For example, in the pp-I branch, we have the reaction where a proton captures a proton to form a deuteron, which then captures another proton to form helium-3, and so on, leading to the production of neutrinos when the boron-8 decays. Those are the lower-energy neutrinos, like the 7 Be ones, which have lower energies, around a few MeV maybe. Whereas the pp-III branch, which produces neutrinos via the helium-3 plus two protons process, maybe those neutrinos are higher in energy.

Wait, but the question is about the flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower energy than band 2.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of higher energy neutrinos would decrease. Because the pp-III neutrinos probably are in the higher energy range, perhaps band 2. So if that stops, the flux in band 2 would decrease more than in band 1.

But wait, are the neutrinos from each branch in different energy ranges? Let me think. I think the neutrinos from the pp-I branch (like the boron-8 decay) have lower energies, say around 1.4 MeV. The pp-III branch's neutrinos are higher. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (like those in band 2, 800-900 keV) would stop coming. But wait
