Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm. Let me read the question carefully.

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe activity coefficients aren't too complicated. The Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait. So, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? Right, because H3PO4 is triprotic. So, the different KAs correspond to the three dissociations. 

So the problem involves both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's think about what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 (which is potassium hydrogen phosphate) dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. It dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but how does that relate to the orthophosphate ion, PO4^3-? Because, I think HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3- and H+.

So the solution is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But I'm being asked about PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form beyond HPO4^2-.

Wait, but how much of that would be present in solution? Because the pKa3 is 12, which is quite high. At pH 25°C,
