Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc., and non-Gaussian states are like Fock states or cat states which are superpositions of these.

The state given is |psi> = ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant, which is given as N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). So, I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) which is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of |psi> and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, the relative entropy here is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. But I'm a bit fuzzy on how to compute this. I think for a pure state, the von Neumann entropy S is -Tr(rho ln rho), but here it's the difference between the state's entropy and the reference Gaussian state's entropy.

Wait, but wait. del_b is the quantum relative entropy between rho and tau. So, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). Because S(rho) is the entropy of the state, and S(tau) is the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

But how do I calculate that? I'm not sure about the exact expressions for rho and tau.

Let me think. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). So, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The reference Gaussian state tau, I think, is the closest Gaussian state to rho. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe tau is the state that maximizes the entropy among all Gaussian states with the same first and second moments as rho. Or perhaps it's the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Because in some measures of non-Gaussianity, like the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, the reference Gaussian state is the one that matches the first and second moments.

But for the relative entropy, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe tau is the fully mixed Gaussian state, but that doesn't make much sense. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the definition given.

Wait, the problem states that the relative entropy measure is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that's S(rho) - S(tau), which would be the difference in their von Neumann entropies. So the non-Gaussianity is this difference.

But how do I compute S(rho) and S(tau)?

Let me start by computing rho. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. A coherent state |alpha> is a Gaussian state, so |alpha> and |-alpha> are both Gaussian. The superposition of two Gaussian states is a non-Gaussian state, so rho = |psi><psi| is non-Gaussian.

The density matrix rho can be written as
