Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators have certain properties, like their eigenvalues relate to the spin of the particle. But wait, the question is about a muon's intrinsic angular momentum, which I think is spin-1/2, just like an electron.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The S matrix's first row is (0 -i) and the second row is (i 0). Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. That matrix looks familiar—it's probably the Pauli matrices. Let me think: the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The sigma_y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So S must be sigma_y, right? So S is sigma_y, and c is h/(4π).

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues a of Ay satisfy Ay φ = a φ. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of sigma_y. What are the eigenvalues of sigma_y? I remember that the eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1. Because, for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are ±1. So sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (1) and c * (-1). Substituting c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues here would be real. Oh wait, wait, no, sigma_y is Hermitian? No, wait, sigma_y is Hermitian because it's a Pauli matrix, so its eigenvalues are real. So Ay is Hermitian multiplied by a real constant, so Ay is Hermitian. So its eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, the matrix S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Let me compute its eigenvalues. The
