Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to walk through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A high K, like 5e10 here, means the complex is very stable, so the calcium isn't just floating around in solution.

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, I think that means the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But what about the dissociation of this complex? Since K is so large, the dissociation should be minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low.

I remember the formula for the formation constant. For a complex like Ca-EDTA, which is usually written as CaY²- (where Y is EDTA), the formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [CaY²-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-] )

But wait, wait, I think I might have that backwards. Or perhaps the equation is written as:

Kf = [CaY²-] / ( [Ca²+][Y] )

Where Y is the EDTA in its deprotonated form, I guess. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact form here. Oh, right, the problem says pH is ideal, so I can assume that the EDTA is fully deprotonated, so [Y] is the concentration of EDTA⁴-.

But wait, since the solution is at pH where EDTA is deprotonated, the concentration of EDTA⁴- is just [EDTA]. So the Kf expression simplifies to [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y]) = Kf.

But wait, in a solution where the CaY²- is the only complex, the total EDTA comes from both the complex and any free EDTA. Hmm, but if Kf is so large, the complex is very stable, so the free EDTA concentration is negligible compared to the complex.

Wait, let me think again. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that almost all the EDTA is in the form of CaY²-. So the free EDTA concentration is almost zero, but I can't just ignore it. Wait, no, because Kf is so large, the dissociation is minimal, so [Ca²+] will be very small.

So, if the concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M, then in the dissociation,
