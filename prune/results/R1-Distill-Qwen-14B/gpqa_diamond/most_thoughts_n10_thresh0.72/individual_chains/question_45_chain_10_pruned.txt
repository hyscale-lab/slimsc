Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, I've studied a bit about particles in a box before, but I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, first, the setup: it's a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. That means the particles are confined between x=0 and x=L, right? And the potential is zero inside and infinite outside, so the particles can't escape. Each particle is spin-1/2, which probably means electrons or something similar—so they have spin up or down. Oh wait, but in a one-dimensional box, the spin doesn't affect the energy, right? Because in a box, the energy levels are purely based on the quantum number and mass. Spin just gives us the multiplicity of the state, but not the energy itself. So maybe the spin part isn't directly relevant to the energy calculation. Or maybe it is in terms of how many particles can occupy each energy level?

Wait, wait. The problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh, right, identical particles with spin-1/2 are fermions, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That is, no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But in a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin state. So for each n, there can be two particles, one with spin up and another with spin down. So each n can hold two particles.

So the particles are fermions, so each energy level (each n) can hold two particles. Since we have four particles, let's think about how they fill up the energy levels.

The energy levels for a particle in a 1D box are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), right? And the problem defines E as E = (π² ħ²)/(2mL²), so E_n = n² E. So each energy level is n squared times E.

Now, when we have multiple particles, we have to consider the Pauli exclusion. So the ground state would be the lowest energy state, which is n=1. Since each n can hold two particles, the first state (n=1) can have two particles. Then the next state is n=2, which can hold another two. So for four particles, they would fill n=1 and n=2 levels.

Wait, wait. Wait, the ground state would be the first state, but when you have multiple particles, the ground state configuration is the lowest possible energy where each state is filled as much as possible according to the Pauli principle.

So for four particles:

- The first energy level, n=1, can hold two particles (spin up and down).
- The second energy level, n=2, holds the next two.

So the four particles would be in n=1 and n=2, each with two spins. So the total energy of the system would be the sum of each particle's energy. But wait, each particle is in a specific state. So for the ground state, all four particles are in the two lowest n levels.

Wait, but wait a second. Do the particles all have the same quantum number n? No, because they can't all be in the same state. So yes, two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy would be (2 particles * E_1) + (2 particles * E_2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Hmm, so the ground state energy is 10E? But wait, the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up the terms here. The question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, the system has a certain energy based on how the particles are arranged. So the ground state is the
