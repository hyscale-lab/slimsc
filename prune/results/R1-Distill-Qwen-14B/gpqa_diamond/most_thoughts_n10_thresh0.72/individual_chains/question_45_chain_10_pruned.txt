Okay, so I've got this problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, first, I should recall the basics. The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n² pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And E is defined as E = pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each energy level E_n is just n² * E. That simplifies things because I can express everything in terms of E.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're fermions, each quantum state can hold at most two particles (because spin can be up or down). So in the ground state, the lowest energy levels will be filled up with as many particles as possible.

So for four particles, let's think about how they fill the states. The ground state will have the lowest possible energy levels filled with two particles each, but wait, each energy level can hold two particles because of spin. So let me list the energy levels.

The energy levels for a single particle are E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4, etc. Each of these can hold two particles because of the two possible spin states.

But since we have four particles, we'll fill the lowest energy levels until we have four particles. Let's see:

- E_1 can hold 2 particles.
- E_2 can hold another 2. So that's 4 particles in total.

So the ground state configuration is that the first two energy levels are filled. So the total energy for the ground state would be 2 particles in E_1 and 2 in E_2.

Wait, but each particle in E_1 has energy E_1 = 1² E = E. Each in E_2 has E_2 = 4E. So the ground state energy would be (2*E) + (2*4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Or do I have to consider each particle's contribution?

Wait no, I think the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. So for four particles, two in E_1 and two in E_2. So each of the two particles in E_1 contribute E each, so 2E. Each of the two in E_2 contribute 4E, so 2*4E=8E. Total is 10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

Now, the first excited state. Wait, the first excited state would be the next possible configuration. Since the ground state has E_1 and E_2 filled, the first excited state would involve the next available energy level, which is E_3. But wait, in a system with identical particles, the ordering might change if particles are promoted.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible configurations beyond the ground state. Since the particles are fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But for energy calculation, maybe I don't have to get into that detail. Let me focus on how the particles fill the states.

Wait, the ground state is E_1 (2 particles) and E_2 (2 particles), so that's all four. The first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. Let me think: which state can't have the lowest energy but is the next higher. Maybe one of the particles in E_2 is promoted to E_3, but wait, that would require... Wait, but if we have four particles, each state can hold two, so after the ground state, the next state would involve the first particle moving to a higher energy level.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the E_2 particles moves to E_3. But wait, each particle in E_2 is already in the lowest possible energy. So for the first excited state, perhaps instead of all four in E_1 and E_2, one is promoted to E_3. But how does that work? Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of quantum numbers. The particles are spin-1/2, so each state is (n, s) where s is spin up or down. But when considering identical particles, the filling is based on their quantum numbers.

So for four particles, the ground state would have the first two energy levels filled.

E_1: n=1, s=↑ and s=↓ → 2 particles.

E_2: n=2, s=↑ and s=↓ → 2 particles.

That's four particles. Ground state total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2*1E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. Since all lower states are filled, the next available state is E_3 (n=3). So one of the particles from E_2 would move to E_3. But wait, each energy level can hold two particles. So if E
