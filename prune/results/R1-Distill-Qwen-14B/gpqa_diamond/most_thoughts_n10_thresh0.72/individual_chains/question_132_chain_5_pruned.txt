Okay, I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Hmm, I remember that in aromatic compounds, the protons can be split into different signals based on their neighboring groups. But wait, the first part mentions two singlets in the aromatic region. How does that happen? Well, for a singlet in aromatic protons, they must be equivalent and not split by adjacent protons. So maybe each compound in the mixture has a set of equivalent aromatic protons that don't split each other, hence appearing as singlets.

But wait, wait. I'm mixing up the concepts. No, waitâ€”each compound's own protons would split into their own signals. But since it's a mixture, maybe each compound contributes a singlet. Wait, but the question says two signals in the aromatic region. So each compound contributes one signal each?

Wait, no. Because if each compound has more than one set of equivalent protons, the NMR would show more signals. But since the mixture is 1:1, each compound's signals would add up. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound has a single type of aromatic proton, which would give a singlet. Because if all aromatic protons are equivalent, like in a para-disubstituted benzene or a highly symmetric structure, the NMR would show a singlet.

Wait, but let me think about the structure of each option.

The compounds given are various tetramethylbenzenes. Let me draw their structures mentally.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So it's a 1,2,3,4-tetra-substituted benzene. How symmetric is that? Well
