Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The question says there's an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and the form of f.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal and symmetric along the z-axis, I'm guessing the radiation pattern might have some symmetry too.

I think the power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle theta. For a dipole antenna, for example, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (theta = 90 degrees) and falls off towards the poles. But wait, this might not be a dipole exactly; it's a spheroid. Maybe it's an oscillating dipole or something else.

Wait, dipole radiation has a specific pattern. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) varies with cos^2(theta), right? So maximum at theta=90 degrees, which would mean that the intensity is proportional to cos^2(theta). But wait, if the maximum is at 90 degrees, then at theta=30 degrees, the intensity would be cos^2(30) = (âˆš3/2)^2 = 3/4. So the fraction would be 3/4 of the maximum. But wait, the question says the maximum is A. Wait, I thought the maximum is when theta is 90 degrees. So if A is the maximum, then at theta=30, the intensity would be (3/4) A? Or wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The power per unit solid angle is f(lambda, theta). The maximum power is A. So f(theta) has a maximum at some theta. But wait, for a dipole, the maximum is at theta=90. So if the maximum is A, then at
