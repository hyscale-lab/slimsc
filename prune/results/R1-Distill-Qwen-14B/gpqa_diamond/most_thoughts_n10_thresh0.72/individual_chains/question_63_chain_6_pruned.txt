Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the molecule is made of two atoms, X and Y. The problem gives me their masses: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. Wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy—so that's probably the next higher energy state. But wait, which transition are they talking about? Rotation, vibration, or both?

I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels account for both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both vibration and rotation. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed, it transitions to the next possible state.

But wait, the next state could be either the first rotational state (changing J) or the first vibrational state (changing vibrational quantum number). Which one requires a lower energy photon? Because the photon's energy would determine the momentum.

Wait, the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which suggests that both rotational and vibrational energies are considered. But when it's in the fundamental state, that's the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1), or maybe a combination of both.

But wait, the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So which transition requires the least energy? Because the photon momentum is related to the energy change via E=pc (since for a photon, energy E equals pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light). So the lower energy transition would correspond to a lower momentum.

So I need to compare the energy required for the first vibrational transition (v=0 → v=1) and the first rotational transition (J=0 → J=1). The one
