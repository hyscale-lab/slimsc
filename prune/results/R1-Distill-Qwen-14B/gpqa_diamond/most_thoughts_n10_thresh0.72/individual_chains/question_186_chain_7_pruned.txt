Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the Cope rearrangement of a specific compound, and I need to find the correct product from the given options.

First, let me recall what the Cope rearrangement is. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. It's a pericyclic reaction, and under certain conditions (like heat or acid), the molecule undergoes a rearrangement where the ends of the conjugated diene swap places.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene means it's a norbornene structure. The numbering would be such that the bridgehead carbons are 1, 4, and 5. The 2-position has a vinyl group (CHâ‚‚=CH-) attached, and it's an azabicyclo, meaning there's a nitrogen in the structure.

Wait, the formula is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the azabicyclo part implies that the nitrogen is at position 2. So the structure has a bridge, and at position 2, there's a substituent which is a vinyl group.

Let me sketch this out. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would look like a norbornene with a double bond between carbons 5 and 6, perhaps. The nitrogen is at position 2, so that's one of the bridgehead positions. The vinyl group is also at position 2, so attached to the same carbon as the nitrogen.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is 2-azabicyclo, so the nitrogen is at position 2. And 2-vinyl, so the same carbon has both a vinyl group and a nitrogen? That doesn't make sense because position 2 is a bridgehead and would typically have two bridge connections. Oh wait, perhaps the structure has the nitrogen in a bridge, so maybe the bicyclo part includes the nitrogen.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene is a norbornene structure, so the bridge is between carbons 1 and 4. The heptene part has seven carbons. So the structure has two bridges: one of two carbons, another of two, and the third of one. So the bridges are between 1-4, 4-5, and 5-1? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the bicyclo notation is [x.y.z], where x >= y >= z, and x + y + z = bridge positions. So bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has
