Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me see what the options are and how I can match the data.

First, let's break down the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. So, 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. Hmm. The possible functional groups here could include amides, esters, maybe amines, or something like that. The IR and NMR will help me figure this out.

Looking at the IR data: medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretching. The strong band at 1720 cm^-1 suggests something like a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or amide. Because 1720 is a bit on the lower side for a carbonyl. Wait, wait. Let me think: aldehydes are around 1700-1720, ketones similar. Esters and amides usually have lower frequencies because of the conjugation with oxygen. Hmm, but wait, amides have their carbonyl around 1650-1700, right? So 1720 might be more indicative of an ester or maybe a ketone. But wait, the molecular formula has two oxygen atoms. Maybe an ester.

Then, looking at the NMR data. Let me go through each peak.

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH3 group next to an oxygen. Like an ethyl group. Because in ethyl esters, the CH3 is around 1.2 as a triplet from coupling with the adjacent CH2.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. A singlet with 2Hâ€”maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps an NH2? Wait, the broadness could indicate something with hydrogen bonding, like an NH or an OH. Or maybe an OCH2 in an ethyl ester. Wait, but the ethyl's CH2 would be around 4.0, right? Because in an ethyl ester, the CH2 connected to the oxygen is usually around 4.0-4.3 as a quartet. But here, it's a broad singlet. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group that's attached to something else.

4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups. Like a CH2 next to another CH2. So perhaps this is the CH2 in an ethyl group, where the adjacent group is another CH2. So, quartet at 4.5 could be the CH2 connected to the carbonyl. So in an ethyl ester, the structure would be R-O-CO-O-R' or wait, no, ester is R-O-C
