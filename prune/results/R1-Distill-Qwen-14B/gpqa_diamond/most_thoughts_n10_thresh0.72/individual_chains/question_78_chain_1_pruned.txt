Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about a point charge moving with some trajectory, and we're supposed to find the scalar and vector potentials at a certain point in space and time.

Wait, the setup: the charge q is moving, and the fields are observed at point r. The vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, d is the vector between those two points. The velocity at the field generating time tr is v.

The problem gives four options for V and A. I remember that potentials are related to the fields via Maxwell's equations, and they depend on the charge's motion.

So, scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law, but when charges are moving, maybe there's a correction term. Oh right, the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just q/(4πε₀ r) anymore because of the motion — or wait, is it? Maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the scalar potential for a charge at rest is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, I think the potential still has a similar form, but perhaps modified by the motion. Alternatively, maybe the vector potential comes into play more when the charge is moving.

Wait, the vector potential A is usually related to the magnetic field. For a moving charge, the current produces a magnetic field,
