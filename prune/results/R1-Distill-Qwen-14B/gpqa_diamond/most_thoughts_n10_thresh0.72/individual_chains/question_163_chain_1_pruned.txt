Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with an acid, they usually undergo a neutralization reaction. 

The problem states that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required. Also, we need to determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options provided are A, B, C, D with different pH values and volumes.

First, I think I should figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed for that. Let me calculate that. Iron's atomic weight is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16 and Hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + (3*(16 +1)). Wait, wait, no. Fe(OH)3 is Fe^3+ and 3 OH^- groups. So each OH- is 17 g/mol. So Fe is 55.85, and 3*(16+1) = 51. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, let me compute that exactly: 0.1 divided by 106.85. Let's see, 106.85 * 0.000936 is roughly 0.1. So approximately 9.36 millimoles.

But wait, wait, more accurately: 0.1 / 106.85 = 0.0009357 moles. So around 9.357e-4 moles.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid like HCl (monobasic, so one H+ per molecule) would be: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 moles.

But wait, the acid is monobasic, so each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. Therefore, the number of moles of acid needed is the same as the number of moles of H+ needed, right? So 0.002807 moles of H+ needed, so we need 0.002807 moles of acid.

But the acid is 0.1 M. So Molarity is moles/volume(L). Rearranging, volume(L) = moles/(Molarity). So volume in liters is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Wait, but wait a minute. Is this the minimum volume?

Wait, but I'm probably missing something. Because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base or a solid, so maybe it's not immediately reacting. Or perhaps the solution's volume is involved in dilution. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "100 cm³ total volume." So the final solution is 100 cm³
