Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², right? And the question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue.

Wait, okay. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. Each energy level depends on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. But wait, no, wait. Oh right, in 3D, the quantum numbers for the harmonic oscillator can be treated in terms of the radial and angular parts. Or wait, no, for the isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. Or is it better to think in terms of the principal quantum number?

Wait, I think for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ℏω, where n is the total quantum number. No, wait. Let me think again. Each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number. So the energy in each direction is (n_x + 1/2) ℏω, similarly for n_y and n_z. So the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ℏω. So the total energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers: n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each n defines an energy level.

Wait, but what about the ordering of the energy levels? Because for the same n, different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z can give the same energy. So the degeneracy, or the number of states with the same energy, depends on how many (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations sum up to a particular n.

So the problem is about the third excited state. But wait, what's the ground state? The lowest energy state is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. So the ground state energy is (0+0+0 + 3/2) ℏω = (3/2) ℏω. The first excited state would be when n increases by
