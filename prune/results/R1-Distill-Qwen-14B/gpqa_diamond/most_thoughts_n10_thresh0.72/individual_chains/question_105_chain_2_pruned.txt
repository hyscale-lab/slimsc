Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the observed brightness. Then it's comparing that scenario to the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet. We need to find the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the star.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the situation. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So, the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, I remember that the filling factor is the fraction of the surface that the spots cover. So if it's 20%, then the spots take up 0.2 of the hemisphere's area. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 * pi R^2 / 2) )? Wait, no. Because a hemisphere is half the sphere, so area is 2 pi R². So the spot area is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

Wait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. The star's brightness is affected by these spots. Normally, spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so when they rotate into view, the star's overall brightness decreases.

But the problem says that the star's brightness variations due to these spots can be mistaken for an exoplanet transiting the star. So we're to find the exoplanet's radius (Rpl) such that the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as that caused by the spots.

Wait, but the setup is that the star's brightness variation due to the spots mimics that of a planet. So we need to model both scenarios and set their brightness amplitudes equal, then solve for Rpl.

Wait, but the question says that the same amplitude in the star's light curve would be produced by an exoplanet. So we
