Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. There are two reactions here, and I need to figure out the major products A and B. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a solvent, but what about KH? I think KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. In acidic conditions, maybe it's acting as a base.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when you have a spiro compound and you deprotonate it, especially in a conjugated system, it can undergo a cyclization. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, right? So this molecule has a vinyl group attached to an spiro ring.

I think the alcohol here is an enol. When treated with a strong base like KH, which is a strong deprotonating agent, maybe the alcohol is deprotonated. But wait, the reaction conditions also have H+. Oh, that's confusing. Wait, no, maybe the H+ is added after the reaction with the base. Or perhaps the H+ is part of the workup.

Wait, maybe I should think about this as a conjugate addition or elimination. Alternatively, when the hydroxyl group is deprotonated, the molecule could form an enolate. But with a vinyl group nearby, perhaps a [1,2]-shift or some kind of cyclization occurs.

Another approach: I remember that in some cases, especially with vinyl spiro alcohols, deprotonation can lead to a conjugate addition or a ring-closing via an enolate. Let me draw the structure mentally. The spiro rings are a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring? Wait, spiro[3.5]non... Hmm, the formula is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So it's a nine-membered spiro compound with a 3 and 5 ring, and a vinyl group at position 1 and an enol at 5?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the structure. The spiro system would consist of two rings
