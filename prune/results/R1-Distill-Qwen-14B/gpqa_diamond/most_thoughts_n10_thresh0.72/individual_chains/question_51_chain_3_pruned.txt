Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the net potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that when you bring a charge near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But since the sphere is grounded, electrons can flow on and off the sphere. Oh right, so the sphere will have induced charges. But wait, since it's grounded, the potential of the sphere must be the same as the ground, which is zero, I guess.

So the setup is: charge q is outside the sphere, which is grounded. Let me visualize it. The sphere is neutral to start with? Or does it have some charge? The problem doesn't say, so I think it's neutral initially.

When you bring a charge q near the sphere, the charges in the sphere will be induced. The sphere is a conductor, so the charges will redistribute. The induced charges will be such that the inside of the conductor (the cavity) has an induced charge opposite to q, and the outer surface will have an induced charge equal to q?

Wait, no, wait. The sphere is a conductor; the charge q outside will induce a charge -q on the inner surface of the sphere, and then the outer surface must have some charge. Since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would go into the ground. So if the sphere was neutral, the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q because the conductor must remain neutral. But wait, no: Wait, the sphere is grounded, which means it can lose or gain electrons. So, the sphere's net charge is determined by the charges induced by the external charge and the grounding.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say the sphere is initially neutral. When you place a positive charge q outside, the electrons in the sphere will be attracted to the near side, leaving the far side positively charged. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess positive charge on the far side can't stay there because it's a conductor. The electrons can move freely. So the induced charge on the inner surface would be -q, and then the outer surface would have zero net charge because the sphere is grounded.
