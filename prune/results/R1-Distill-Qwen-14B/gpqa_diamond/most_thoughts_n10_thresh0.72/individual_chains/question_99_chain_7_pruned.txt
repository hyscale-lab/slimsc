Alright, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Okay, let's read through the question again carefully. So, we've got an unknown compound that's been characterized using FTIR and 1H NMR. The goal is to identify which structure it is from the given options.

First, looking at the FTIR data. The problem states there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR are often due to O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, the other peak is at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a strong absorption. That's probably a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But the broad peak suggests it's a carboxylic acid because the O-H in carboxylic acids is usually broad and around that region. So the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR. The problem says there are several peaks, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So vinyl groups (like double bonds) are not present. So whatever the structure is, it's not something with a double bond, which rules out any possibility of substituted alkenes or something like that.

Looking at the options, all of them end with "COOH," so they're all carboxylic acids. That makes sense with the IR data. Now, the NMR part. The question mentions two specific signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns.

In NMR, splitting occurs due to neighboring protons. Each neighboring set adds a split. So a doublet of triplets means each proton is next to two different sets of non-equivalent protons. Wait, maybe more accurately, a doublet of triplets would result from coupling with two different groups. Alternatively, maybe each splitting is due to adjacent groups.

Let me think about each option's structure and the expected NMR signals.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

So the structure is something like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me draw it. So each of the central carbons (the ones attached to the CH2 and the COOH) is attached to a methyl and an ethyl group. Wait, no, in this case, each C(H)(C2H5) would be a carbon attached to two ethyl groups and a hydrogen. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is more like CH3 attached to a CH group that's connected to a C2H5, then another CH connected to another C2H5, then a CH2 and then COOH. Wait, perhaps it's a geminal diethyl group, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, it's maybe like:
