Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read it carefully and then break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. 

Another clue is that the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Also, substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm. Let me think about each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction suggests maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid. Let's say Y is an acid. So if X is a metal, Y could be an acid, like HCl, H2SO4, etc.

The gas W: the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must be something like H2O maybe? Because H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons), and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Wait, but the molecule as a whole: each molecule would have 8 protons (from O) and 2 from H's, so total protons 10. Neutrons would be 8 from O and 0 from H's, so 8. Oh, but that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's CO2? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. The molecule of the gas has same number of protons and neutrons. So if the molecule is, say, H2O, each molecule has 10 protons (2 H, 8 O) and 8 neutrons (from O). So protons (10) vs neutrons (8) don't match. Alternatively, what about NH3? Protons: 14 (N has 7, H has 1 each, 3H gives 3). Neutrons: N has 7, H has 0. So total neutrons 7. 14 protons vs 7 neutrons, not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the gas is CH4. Protons: 6 (C) + 4 (H) = 10. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0. So 6. Not equal. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the gas is O2. Each O has 8 protons, so O2 has 16 protons. Neutrons per O is 8, so total 16. Wait, that's equal. O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons (each O has 8, so 2 atoms make 16 each). So gas W is O2?
