Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's number the positions. Position 1 is where the ethoxy group is attached. Position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group.

Wait, wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Wait, in benzene derivatives, the numbering starts at the first substituent and goes clockwise. Oh, but the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, let me visualize this: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, they're all meta to each other? No, wait, 1,2,3 are adjacent, so they must be ortho and meta in a way. Wait, no, benzene is a ring. Let me sketch this mentally. Positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So, the substituents are in a way that each is next to the others. Hmm, so it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But in this case, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering would have the substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, how do we get these substituents onto the benzene ring in the correct order considering the directing effects of each group
