Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). Oh wait, I think that's a two-component spinor, right? So the electron is described by the spin state vector (3i, 4)^T, I suppose.

Wait, the problem also gives the sigma_y matrix. Sigma y is the Pauli matrix for the y-direction. Right, the Pauli matrices are used in the spin operators. The expectation value is calculated using the formula <S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ>, where S_y is (ħ/2) times sigma_y. Because, I remember that the spin angular momentum operators are S = (ħ/2) sigma.

So first, I think I need to write down the state vector. The state is (3i, 4), so I can write this as a column vector:
ψ = [3i; 4]

Next, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the sigma_y matrix. So sigma_y is:
0  -i
i   0

So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Now, the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ. Oh wait, no, wait. The expectation value is ψ^dagger multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ. So in matrix terms, that's ψ† S
