Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². So I remember that the isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator is a common problem in quantum mechanics, and the energy levels are quantized.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what I know about the 3D harmonic oscillator. In three dimensions, the potential is separable into x, y, and z components, each being a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The energy levels for each dimension are quantized as (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...).

Wait, but in 3D, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction. So the total energy would be E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω, where nx, ny, nz are the quantum numbers for each direction. Alternatively, since the 3D oscillator is isotropic, it's often described in terms of a single quantum number n, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. So n = nx + ny + nz. Then the energy becomes E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

Right, that makes sense. So each energy level is determined by the value of n. The ground state is n=0, first excited n=1, second n=2, third n=3, and so on.

Wait, but wait. The question says the third excited state. So let me think: ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0. The first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state corresponds to n=3.

So the energy should be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Wait, no, wait: wait, the formula is E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So for n=3
