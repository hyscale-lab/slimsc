Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options, a to d, each describing different properties of the planets. The options given are A to D, each corresponding to one of these a-d.

Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, the formula is density = mass/volume. For planets, particularly rocky ones, their density is influenced by both mass and radius (since volume depends on radius). 

Looking at each option:

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So its density should be the same as Earth's, which is about 5.5 g/cm³. That's Earth's average density.

Option b) is a planet with twice Earth's mass and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, option b says it has a density of 5.5. But wait, if the mass is 2 Earth masses, but the density is the same as Earth, then the volume would be (2M_earth) / (5.5). But wait, Earth's density is 5.5, so if this planet has the same density, but twice the mass, then its volume would be (2 * M_earth) / (5.5) — which would mean M/V is the same as Earth, so same density. So why is option b's density given as 5.5? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps option b is saying that the planet's density is 5.5, not that it's the same as Earth. So then, if a planet has mass 2 Earth masses and density 5.5, then what? Let me calculate. So, for Earth, density is 5.5, which is mass/volume. So the volume is M/(5.5). For option b, mass is 2M, density is 5.5, so volume is (2M)/(5.5). So the volume scales with mass if density is same. So that planet's radius would be larger than Earth's, because volume depends on radius cubed. So, what's the density? It's 5.5, same as Earth. So its density is the same as Earth.

Wait, but wait. The question is which has the highest density. So if option b is 5.5, and Earth is 5.5, then any higher would be better. But wait, other options may have higher.

Option c) a planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density as Earth, right? Because composition affects density a lot. So if it's same composition, density is same. So density is 5.5. So same as a, b, and c. Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, wait. If a planet has same composition as Earth but is more massive, its radius would increase. But density is mass/volume. For same composition, if mass increases more than volume, density would increase. Wait, no. Wait, for a uniform composition, as you increase mass, the volume increases as the cube of radius, which is proportional to the 3
