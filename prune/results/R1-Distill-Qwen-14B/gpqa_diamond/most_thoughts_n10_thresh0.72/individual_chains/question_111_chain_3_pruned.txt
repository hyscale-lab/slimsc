Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B. I need to figure out the major products for each and then choose the correct option from A to D.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong base, so I'm thinking this is some kind of enolate formation followed by an alkylation or maybe an aldol addition.

Wait, ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester. Acrylate esters are good Michael acceptors, right? So maybe this is a Michael addition. Or wait, is it a conjugate addition? Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen-like condensation.

Wait, the starting material is cyclohexanone with substituents. Let me draw the structure. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since both 2 and 6 have methyl from the name). Wait, no, 2,6-dimethyl would have methyl groups on carbons 2 and 6. So the structure is cyclohexanone with substituents on 2 and 6. Specifically, at position 2, there's an ethyl and a methyl group. So the ring has a ketone at C1, and at C2, there's an ethyl and a methyl attached.

So, when t-BuOK is present, it's a strong, bulky base. It would deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. But wait, in which position? The enolate would form where? The ketone is at C1, so the alpha carbons are at C2 and perhaps others? Wait, the cyclohexanone has alpha carbons adjacent to the ketone. So in this case, the alpha carbons are at C2 and possibly C6 and maybe C3? Wait, let's think about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the enolate forms
