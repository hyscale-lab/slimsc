Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The scenario is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has Earth's radius, is in a circular orbit, and has a transit impact parameter of 0.2. Its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet is larger—2.5 times Earth's radius—and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane, and the star has 1.5 times the Sun's radius.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit its star, the planet must pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. The impact parameter is the distance, in terms of stellar radii, that the planet's center misses the star's center during transit. An impact parameter of 0.2 means the planet's path is 0.2 times the star's radius away from the center.

Wait, no, actually, the transit impact parameter (b) is the perpendicular distance of the planet's path from the star's center, expressed in units of the star's radius. So a lower impact parameter means a closer approach. But for a transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of the star, so b must be less than or equal to the sum of the planet's radius and the star's radius? Or wait, no, wait—no, the impact parameter is measured relative to the star's radius. So for a transit, the planet must pass within that parameter.

Wait, no, more accurately, the impact parameter is the distance in units of the star's radius from the center. So a planet with a larger impact parameter would have a more grazing transit. But for a transit to occur, the planet must pass within the star's disk, so the impact parameter must be less than or equal to the planet's radius plus the star's radius? Or wait, no, no, wait. Actually, no, because the impact parameter is just the distance from the star's center. So for a transit, the planet must pass in front, so the planet's distance from the star's center (impact parameter) must be less than the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius? Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, no, the impact parameter is the distance of the planet's path from the star's center. For the planet to transit, the planet must pass in front of the star, so the distance (impact parameter) must be less than the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius? No, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Suppose the star's radius is R*, planet's radius R_p. For the planet to transit, the planet must pass in front of the star. The condition for that is that the planet's path (as seen from Earth) must pass within the star's disk. The impact parameter (b) is the distance in units of the star's radius. So the actual distance is b * R*. For a transit to occur, the planet must pass within the star's disk. The condition is that the planet's path comes within (R* + R_p) distance from the center? Wait, no, because
