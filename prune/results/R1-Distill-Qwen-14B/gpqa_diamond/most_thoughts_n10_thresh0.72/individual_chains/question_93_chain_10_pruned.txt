Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me remember what I know about qPCR and calibration curves. 

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples in technical replicates. The efficiency is 100%, which means the PCR is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. R² is 1, so the data fits the standard curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3. Hmm, I think a standard slope for a qPCR calibration curve is around -3.32, which would indicate a 100% efficient PCR because the formula for the slope is -3.322 when efficiency is 100%. So that makes sense.

Looking at the results, they have different concentrations and corresponding CT values. The higher the concentration (more copies), the lower the CT because you reach the threshold sooner. 

Wait, but the question is about the discrepancies in his results. Let me look at each concentration and their CTs.

At 100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is about 34.2. 

10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average 31. 

1,000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Average 27.6.

100: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Avg 24.3.

10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Avg around 21.

Wait, now looking at the differences between the concentrations. Let's see the change in CT per 10-fold dilution. Each step is a 10-fold dilution. 

From 100,000 to 10,000 is 10-fold, and the CT increases by 3.6 (34.2 -30.6). Wait, but if each 10-fold dilution should change the CT by about 3.3 cycles (since the slope is -3.3), then a 10-fold should increase CT by 3.3. 

Wait, let's calculate the differences. The first step is from 100,000 to 10,000: CT goes from 30.6 to 34.2? Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, higher concentration (100,000) would have lower CT. So 100,000's CT is ~34.2, and 10,000 is ~31. So the step from 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10-fold higher concentration (since 10,000 is a 10-fold dilution of 100,000) and the CT is lower. The difference in CT is 34.2 - 30.6 = 3.6. Hmm, which is more than 3.3. 

Wait, maybe I should think of it the other way. From 10,000 to 1,000: 10,000 is 10x more than 1,000. So the CT should go up by ~3.3. Let's see: 30.6 to 27.3. 30.6 -27.3=3.3. Oh, exactly 3.3. So that's perfect. 

Wait, check the next step: from 1,000 to 100 is another 10-fold dilution. The CT goes from 27.3 to 24.3 (27.3 -24.3=
