Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the setup is that someone did an experiment on white lupine plants to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each—g1, g2, g3—and some double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. 

From the experiment results, each mutant's resistance to the pathogen is given as a percentage of the control (which is 100% resistant). The results are:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Now, the question is about determining the interactions of these genes based on the data. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different conclusions about which gene is a transcription factor, whether the others have pleiotropy or redundancy, and which gene is epistatic to another.

Hmm. So, in genetics, a transcription factor is a protein that controls the expression of genes. Since at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream, meaning it's regulating others, the others might be downstream.

Looking at the results, I think the key is to see how the single and double mutants affect the resistance. 

So, for the single mutants:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it. So, G1's product is helpful but not essential. Maybe G1 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, and even without it, some resistance remains because other pathways are working.
- g2 has 0% resistance. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That's a big effect. So G2's product is essential for resistance. Since the transcription factor is upstream, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor. Because if G2 is a TF, then knocking it out would mean all downstream genes it controls aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.
- g3 has 50% resistance. So, knocking out G3 reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it. So G3's product contributes to resistance but isn't the only factor. 

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either single mutant. That suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in the same pathway but maybe have additive effects. Or perhaps they are redundant, but that would have a more severe effect in the double mutant.

Wait, but if they are in the same pathway, the double mutant might not be worse than the more severe single mutant. Let me think. For example, if G1 and G3 are both activating the same downstream gene, then knocking out both would have the same effect as the more severe single mutant. But in this case, G1's single mutant is 75%, G3's is 50%, so the double is 10% which is worse than either. So perhaps they are in separate pathways but both contribute to the same overall outcome. Or perhaps they're in the same pathway but act additively.

Wait, but I'm not sure yet. Let's look at other double mutants.

g2g3: 0% resistance. So, when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is zero. But wait
