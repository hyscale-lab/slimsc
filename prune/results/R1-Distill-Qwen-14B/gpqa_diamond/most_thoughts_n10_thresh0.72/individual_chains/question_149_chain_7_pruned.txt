Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Hmm, I need to figure out what's going on here.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what we'd expect. So, it's not like there's an extra proton because the integral is correct. The coupling pattern also rules out spin-spin coupling, so maybe it's not vicinal coupling or something. 

Then, looking at the LC-MS data, there are two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. That suggests two different compounds with the same molecular weight are present. But wait, the mass spec is consistent with the expected molecule. So maybe it's not a different compound but the same one in different forms.

Let me think about the options:

Option A: Contaminated with precursor. If that's the case, the mass would be different because the precursor has a different molecular weight. But the question says both have the same mass, so probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so LC-MS would show two peaks if they're enantiomers and the column isn't chiral. But in NMR, for enantiomers, the alpha protons would be equivalent because the molecule is chiral but each enantiomer would have the same NMR spectrum. Wait, but if the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak because in solution, the protons are equivalent. Hmm, maybe not B.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling? I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe it's when a proton couples with two different protons. But the question says the coupling pattern doesn't explain it because it's not spin-spin coupling. So perhaps the issue isn't about coupling between protons but something else.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so in LC-MS, they would elute at different times but have the same molecular weight. In NMR, diastereomers would have different chemical shifts. So if the molecule has two diastereomers, each would show their own peaks. But wait, the NMR showed two peaks for the same alpha proton. So, maybe these diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment? No, that doesn't make much sense. Diastereomers usually have different NMR shifts because the environments are different.

Wait, but the question states that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So, why would the same proton appear as two peaks? Maybe it's due to something like exchange between different environments, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a racemic mixture. But earlier I thought enantiomers wouldn't cause separate NMR peaks.

Wait, no. If the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak because the two enantiomers are mirror images. The protons would be equivalent in each enantiomer, so the peak would just
