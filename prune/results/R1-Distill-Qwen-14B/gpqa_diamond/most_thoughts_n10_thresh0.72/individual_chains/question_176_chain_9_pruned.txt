Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to remember.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The system's state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented by vectors in a complex vector space, right? But here, the components are real numbers. Maybe it's still a valid state vector, but I should note that.

The operators for P and Q are given as matrices. So, P is a 3x3 matrix where the first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. The Q matrix is diagonal: [1, 0, 0] first row, [0, 0, 0] second, and [0, 0, -1] third. So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Wait, the question is about measuring P first and then Q. But it says, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Oh wait, noâ€”no, wait. The wording is: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So, the first measurement is P, resulting in 0, and then the second measurement is Q, resulting in -1. So the order is P first, then Q.

Wait, no, the question says: "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". So the sequence is P first, then Q. So I'm looking for the probability that P is measured as 0, and then, given that, Q is measured as -1.

Wait no, wait. Wait, actually, the way measurements work is that measuring P first collapses the state into an eigenstate of P, then measuring Q on that new state. Or perhaps, since P and Q might not commute, the order matters.

But first, let me find the possible outcomes for P. The operator P isn't diagonal, so finding its eigenvalues might be necessary. Alternatively,
