Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a mouthful. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, it's attached to the bridgehead of the norbornane system.

Then, this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, sodium iodide with dibromomethyl groups? That sounds like a possible dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Wait, more likely, it's an SN2 substitution. But wait, each of the dibromomethyl groups has two bromine atoms. So, each of those could undergo substitution, right?

Wait, the diene has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So each of those is -CH2Br2. When combining with NaI, perhaps the bromide ions will substitute the dibromomethyl groups. But wait, each of those has two Br atoms. So for each group, substitution would happen twice. But wait, sodium iodide is present, and I- is a good nucleophile. Hmm, maybe each dibromomethyl group will lose a Br and gain an I. Wait, but with two Br atoms on each CH2, perhaps each can substitute.

Wait, but sodium iodide has I- as the nucleophile. So each -CH2Br2 might react, each Br being replaced by I. So for each, two substitutions. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2? Or wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by I in a stepwise manner. But wait, the reaction is with 2 equivalents of the diene and 2 equivalents of sodium iodide? Or maybe each diene molecule has two Br atoms, so two equivalents would substitute all four Brs.

Wait, perhaps when each -CH2Br2 reacts,
