Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to pick the major products for each. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products A and B. Hmm, let's tackle each reaction one by one.

First reaction: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, I'll draw this structure to visualize. Benzene ring connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a CH2 group. Then, the butenyl group is attached to that oxygen. The butenyl is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So, structure would be: benzene-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, let me think again. The but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but since it's 3-methyl, the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait no, wait. Butenyl is four carbons. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl has the double bond between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at C2. So, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- group. But wait, the substituent is 3-methyl, so the third carbon has a methyl branch. So the structure of the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons. Let me number it: 1, 2, 3, 4. But-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But the substituent is 3-methyl. So, on carbon 3, which is the third carbon from the point of attachment (which is carbon 1), so that would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no. Let me think again. For 3
