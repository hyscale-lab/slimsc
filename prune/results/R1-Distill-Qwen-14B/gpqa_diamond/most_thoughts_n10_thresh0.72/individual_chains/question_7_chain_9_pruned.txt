Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the annihilation of high-energy gamma rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, the question is asking at what energy the gamma rays' lifetimes are limited by the process where they annihilate with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs. The given average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV.

Wait, I remember that the interaction rate of a gamma ray with the CMB is related to the photon density and the cross-section for the gamma-gamma reaction. The lifetime of the gamma ray would be limited when the interaction rate becomes significant, so the lifetime is inversely proportional to the interaction rate.

The gamma-gamma cross-section for producing electron-positron pairs peaks at a certain energy. I think the cross-section for this process increases as the center-of-mass (CM) energy increases, but there's a threshold for the process. Oh right, the threshold is when the CM energy is at least twice the rest mass of the electron, so 2*0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. So the gamma and photon need to have a combined energy of at least this.

Wait, but in this problem, the process is gamma + photon â†’ e+ + e-. So the gamma has high energy, and the photon is from the CMB, which is at low energy (1e-3 eV). So the energy of the photon is E_photon = 1e-3 eV. The gamma has energy E_gamma, which is much larger.

In the lab frame, the photon has energy E_photon, and the gamma has E_gamma. The center-of-mass energy squared s is given by the square of the sum of their four-momenta. So s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_photon c)^2. But since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, and for photons, E = pc. So for the gamma, p_gamma = E_gamma/(c), and for the photon, p_photon = E_photon/(c).

So s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 / c^2 * c^2? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, let's compute it correctly.

The four-momentum of the gamma is (E_gamma/c, p_gamma_x, p_gamma_y, p_gamma_z), and the photon is (E_photon/c, p_photon_x, p_photon_y, p_photon_z). Assume they're moving in the same direction, so their momenta add. So the total energy is E_gamma + E_photon, and the total momentum is E_gamma/(c) + E_photon/(c) [since p = E/(c) for massless particles].

Then, s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. So:

s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - ( (E_gamma + E_photon ) )^2

Wait, because p_total c = E_gamma + E_photon, since each p c is E for each photon.

So s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 = 0? That can't be right. Oh wait, no, I think I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me write it more carefully. The four-momentum squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. For photons, E = p c, so p1 = E1/(c), p2 = E2/(c).

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/(c) ) c + (E2/(c)) c )^2
= (E1 + E2)^2 - ( E1 + E2 )^2
= 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Then s would be zero, which can't be correct because for the process to happen, s should be above (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, that can't be right because
