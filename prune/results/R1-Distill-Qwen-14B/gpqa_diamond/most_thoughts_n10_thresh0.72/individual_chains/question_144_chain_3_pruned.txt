Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about a meson resonance called X. They're asking what the mean decay distance is. The given values are production energy E_X equals 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with various distances in meters.

Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The mean decay distance probably relates to how far the meson travels before it decays. But how do I calculate that?

I think the key here is to find the lifetime of the meson first because the decay distance would be the product of its speed and lifetime. Oh wait, right, the mean lifetime (τ) is related to the width Γ. I recall that the natural line width is Γ, and the uncertainty principle relates the width to the lifetime. The formula for the lifetime from the width is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, actually, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. No, wait, wait. I think the relation is Γ equals ħ over τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. Or maybe it's the other way around? Let me think. The lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. So if Γ is larger, the lifetime is shorter. So yes, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, the units matter. Let me think about the units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something like that. I'll need to convert the units properly.

Once I have the lifetime, I need the speed of the meson. To find the speed
