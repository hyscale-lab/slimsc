Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question involves identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of its product after a reaction. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh right, it's like a crown ether and can help in deprotonating certain compounds, especially in epoxide ring openings. So maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring opening of an epoxide.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So if Compound X is an epoxide, the reaction might be causing some kind of rearrangement or ring-opening, but the product is giving us the NMR signals. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination to form a double bond. Or maybe it's a rearrangement like a Wagner-Meerwein shift. Alternatively, the reaction could be an epoxide opening with the base, but I'm not entirely sure.

Let me look at the product NMR data.

The 1H NMR shows:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

And the 13C NMR shows:
- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Alright, let's break this down.

Starting with the 1H NMR. There are two singlets at around 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3H. Singlets for 3H usually indicate methyl groups attached to something deshielded or where the adjacent atoms don't have protons. Maybe carbonyl groups or something else. Wait, could they be adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide? Or perhaps attached to a double bond or aromatic ring.

Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So four peaks in the aromatic region. Let me think about how that might look. A doublet at 6.75 and another at 7.68, each integrating to 1H, and two doublets at 7.08 and 7.71, each 2H. Maybe this is a para-substituted styrene? Or something with substituents on a benzene ring.

Wait, but four peaks in the aromatic region could suggest a pattern of two doublets of doublets, but the integration is 1,2,1,2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with substituents leading to a para pattern. Let's think: perhaps a para-disubstituted benzene with some substituents leading to two doublets each for two protons.

Wait, but if it's a mono-substituted benzene, like a styrene group, the ring would have two sets of protons. For example, in a para-substituted ring, you get two doublets.

Wait, but wait, the 1H NMR has four peaks: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So that's 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 H. Wait, but a benzene ring has 6 H, but if there's substitution, maybe some H are lost. Wait, but 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) are each single H, and 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) are each two H. So perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to a benzene? Or maybe a benzyl group with a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has its own protons, leading to more peaks.

Wait, perhaps this is a styryl group. Styryl is an aryl-vinyl group. So maybe a benzene ring attached to a CH2CH2 group or something.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR. There's a peak at 197.7 ppm, which is a carbonyl. That's a high value, maybe a ketone or an ester or perhaps an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxide carbons are around 50-60 ppm, I think. Wait, no, maybe the carbonyl in the product is from a ring-opening or a rearrangement. Or perhaps it's an exo-methylene group, but that's usually around 140-150 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but 197 is high for a ketone
