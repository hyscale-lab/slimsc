Okay, so I have this question about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. The options are four different organic compounds. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the IR data. The IR shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretching. Since the compound has an N, I'm thinking maybe an amide or an amine. Then, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a good sign for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide.

Next, the 1H NMR data: 

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. This could be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like an O or N. Maybe an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) but wait, ethyl groups are usually lower. Wait, the triplet at 1.20 is the CH3, so the CH2 would be around 4.0? Or maybe it's an NCH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH2.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet usually comes from coupling with two sets of neighboring protons. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Or maybe a triplet of triplets? Alternatively, in an ethyl group, the CH2 next to the oxygen would be a quartet. Wait, the ethyl group in an ester is typically OCH2CH3. The CH2 attached to O is usually around 4.0-4.3 ppm, as a quartet. But here, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, maybe that's the case. But wait, the 1.20 ppm is the triplet, so that's the CH3. So the neighboring CH2 would be at around 4.0-4.3 as a quartet. So perhaps the 4.5 ppm is something else?

Wait, so the 4.5 ppm is a quartet for 2H. Hmm. Maybe that's part of a group like CH2CO. Or perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an amide group.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring, because the doublets suggest coupling between two protons each on adjacent carbons. So for example, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the two protons on each substituent would be doublets. So maybe there's two substituents on the benzene ring
