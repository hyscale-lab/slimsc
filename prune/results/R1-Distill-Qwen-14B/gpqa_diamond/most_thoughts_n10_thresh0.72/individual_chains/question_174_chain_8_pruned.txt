Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to figure it out step by step.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Oh wait, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, M_initial = M, and M1 + M2 = 0.99 M. But wait, since one is twice the other, let me denote the masses. Let me call the lighter fragment m, then the heavier is 2m. So m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the masses are m = 0.33 M and 2m = 0.66 M. Wait, but that adds up to 0.99 M, which is correct.

Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. That means their velocities are in opposite directions, and their momenta are equal in magnitude.

Now, the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. And we need to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, so for each fragment, I need to calculate their kinetic energies using both relativistic and classical methods and find the difference.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that when we calculate using the classical approximation, which would neglect relativistic effects, so for each fragment, the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv^2. But in reality, since the masses are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light (I think, given the high mass and energy), we need to use relativistic equations.

So, let's model this. Let me denote the two fragments as A and B, with masses m and 2m, respectively. Let’s say fragment A is the more massive one (wait no, wait! Wait, no, the problem says the more massive fragment has kinetic energy T1. So the more massive fragment is
