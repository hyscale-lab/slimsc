Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question involves an experiment where compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. They give the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product and ask us to identify compound X from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I think this reagent is actually used for opening epoxides, or maybe it's part of the process in some kind of ring-opening reaction or another kind of reaction. Or wait, maybe it's a base used in certain reactions, like the opening of epoxides. Alternatively, wait, another thought: the reaction conditions might involve an acid or base. Wait, but the solvent is nonpolarâ€”maybe like THF or something else. 

Wait, but the product's NMR is given, so perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation. Or maybe the reaction is an epoxide ring opening. Hmm. Let me think. Oh wait, compound X is the starting material, and after reaction, the product is formed. So the question is about the starting material, X, which when reacted, gives a product that has the given NMR.

Wait, but wait, the reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh! That's a common base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh wait, or is it used in epoxide formation? No, wait, another possibility: it's used in the Sharpless epoxidation? Or maybe it's a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of the reaction that forms an epoxide.

Wait, but another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as DBU (1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene), but wait, no, DBU is a different structure. Wait, no, DBU is [5.4.0], perhaps. So, maybe
