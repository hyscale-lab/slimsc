Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is measured to be θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are from 10^59 to 10^66 J/K. 

Wait, entropy of a black hole... I remember something about the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Oh right! The entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. So I need to find the area first.

But how do I get the area from the angular size? Well, the angular size θ relates to the actual size (like the diameter) of the event horizon. The formula I think is θ ≈ (R) / (d), where R is the radius of the event horizon and d is the distance. This is because for small angles, the tangent of the angle is approximately equal to the opposite side over the adjacent in a right triangle, so tanθ ≈ θ (in radians) ≈ R/d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees. I need to convert that to radians. Oh right, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 10^-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ (10^-17) * 3.1416 / 180 ≈ approximately 1.745e-19 radians.

So R ≈ θ * d. Wait, but wait, θ is in radians, and R is the radius. So R = θ * d. Let me plug in the numbers.

d is 10^10 parsecs. Wait, how big is a parsec? 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = θ_rad * d. Let me compute θ_rad:

θ_rad = 1e-17 deg * (π/180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So R = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m ≈ 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26.

Let me compute that: 1.745 * 3.086 ≈ 5.375. Then exponents: 10^(-19+26) = 1e7. So R ≈ 5.375e7 meters.

Wait, but wait, the radius of the event horizon of a black hole is given by R = 2 G M / c^2, right? So R is about 2.95 km per solar mass, but wait, I might not need that now because I already have R from the angular size.

But perhaps I can proceed to find the area. The area A is 4π R^2. So let's compute R^2 first.

R is 5.375e7 m. So R^2 is (5.375e7)^2 = (5.375)^2 * 1e14 ≈ 28.9 * 1e14 = 2.89e15 m².

Multiply by 4π: A ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 2.89e15 ≈ 12.566 * 2.89e15 ≈ approx 36.3e15 m², which is 3.63e16 m².

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake with the exponents. Wait, 5.375e7 squared is (5.375)^2 is about 28.9, and (1e7)^2 is 1e14, so 28.9e14, which is 2.89e15 m². Then 4π times that is approx 4*3.14=12.56 * 2.89e15 = 36.3e15 m², which is 3.63e16 m². So area is about 3.63e16 m².

Now plug into the entropy formula. S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). But I remember that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) multiplied by (k_B is Boltzmann's constant). Wait, no, the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) in units where ħ=c=G=1, but let me think in SI units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula as S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/(4)) Wait, no, I think the correct expression is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Wait, let me get the units right.

Wait, the area A is in m², c is m/s, ħ is J·s, G is m^3/(kg·s^2), and k_B is J/K.

So S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B) * something? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula as S = (A) * (k_B c^3) / (4 ħ G). Because I'm a bit confused, maybe I can look for the constants.

Wait, I think the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). So S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G).

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed with that. So I need to compute this.

Let me plug in the numbers:

A ≈3.63e16 m².

Compute the numerator: A * k_B c^3.

k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K.

c is 3e8 m/s. So c^3 is (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So numerator: 3.63e16 m² * 1.38e-23 J/K * 2.7e25 m³/s³.

Wait, let's compute the exponents and the coefficients separately.

Coefficients: 3.63 * 1.38 * 2.7 ≈ let's see, 3.63*1.38 is about 5.00, times 2.7 is about 13.5.

Exponents: 1e16 * 1e-23 * 1e25 = 1e(16-23+25) = 1e18.

So numerator ≈
