Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying after some time has passed without it decaying.

Alright, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so that means that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32. But wait, I'm a bit confused. In radioactive decay, I remember that the decay follows an exponential law, right? So the decay probability over time isn't linear. Oh wait, maybe they're talking about the probability within a certain time frame.

So the setup is: we have an atom, and we start monitoring it. After 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we're asking, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, 50 minutes have passed, and then we're looking at the next 150, which would be a total of 200 minutes. Or is it from the current time, which is 50 minutes in?

Wait, no. Let me read it again. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're looking at is 150 minutes from now. So the total time since the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the initial decay probability given is for 100 minutes. So I think I need to model this using the exponential decay formula.

Wait, what's the general formula for radioactive decay? The number of undecayed nuclei at time t is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The probability that a single atom has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). But wait, in the problem, they state the probability within 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). From that, I can find λ.

Let me write that equation again:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

So e^(-λ *100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Taking natural log on both sides:

-
