Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. From what I understand, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here, but maybe it's just extra info.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is same, T is same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the stars are radiating as black bodies. So that's settled.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, this should apply.

So, to find the luminosity ratio, L1/L2, let's plug in the values.

Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. T1 = T2 because their peak wavelengths are the same. So,

L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ (T1)^4
L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ (T2)^4

Dividing L1 by L2:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

Since T1 = T2, the T factor is (1)^4 = 1. So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem gives the radial velocities as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. How does that affect anything?

Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But the question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest (their peak emission) are the same. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Wait
