Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through this.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write down what S looks like. The first row is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices for spin-½ particles are similar. Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is actually the same as this S matrix. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So S here is the σ_y matrix.

So Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π). So substituting, Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's recall that for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let's compute Ay first. Since S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Wait, no, wait. Wait, because c is h/(4π) and S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so each element of S is multiplied by c. So the elements of Ay are:
- Ay_11 = 0 * c = 0
- Ay_12 = (-i) * c = (-i) * (h/(4π))
- Ay_21 = i * c = i * (h/(4π))
- Ay_22 = 0 * c = 0

So the matrix Ay is:
[ 0          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  0          ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

The determinant is calculated as ( ( -λ ) * ( -λ ) ) - ( ( (-i h)/(4π) ) * ( (i h)/(4π) ) ) ) = λ^2 - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, let's compute the elements:

Matrix (Ay - λ I) is:
[-λ      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -λ    ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ ( (-i h)/(4π) ) * ( (i h)/(4π) ) ]

Compute each part:

(-λ)(-λ) = λ²

The second term is [ (-i h)/(4π) ] * [ (i h)/(4π) ] 

Multiply those two: (-i)(i) = (-i²)
