Okay, so I've got this question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax in astronomy is the apparent shift in position of a star due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So it's like, how many stars you'd expect to find when you look at a range of parallaxes. Since stars are uniformly distributed, that means the same number per unit volume, right?

But wait, the volume in this contextâ€”how does that relate to parallax? Oh, because distance is related to parallax. So let's think about it. If I have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance?

Parallax plx is 1/d, so distance d = 1/plx. If plx increases, the distance decreases. So a larger parallax means a closer star. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with plx. So as plx increases (closer stars), do we have more stars in a given plx range?

Wait, no, because as plx increases, the volume of space you're considering decreases. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the volume. The number of stars depends on how much volume you're
