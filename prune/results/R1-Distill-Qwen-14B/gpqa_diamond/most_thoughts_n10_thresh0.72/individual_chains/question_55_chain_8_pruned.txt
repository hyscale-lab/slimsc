Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is among the four options. Let's see what I remember about NMR and how to interpret these spectra.

The question gives me the 1H NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

The options are two propenyl and two butenyl acetates, with cis and trans isomers.

First, I think I should draw the structures of each possible compound to see which one fits the NMR data.

Wait, acetates are esters, right? So the general structure would be R-O-C-O-R', where the R and R' groups are alkenes in this case. But wait, no, wait: propenyl and butenyl are substituents attached to the oxygen. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3 or something like that? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Actually, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. So propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2CHCH3 attached via the oxygen. Wait, maybe I should get the structures right.

Wait, the four options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate: So, CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. So butenyl would be like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or something?

Wait, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH3CH=CHCH2-? Wait, no, butenyl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond. The substituents could be in different positions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible structures of each option.

Let me list all four:

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. The butenyl group is in the cis configuration. So, the structure would be CH2CH2 with
