Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is given as f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, so the question is about evaluating ∫ (∇·f) dV over a spherical volume. I remember that there's a divergence theorem involved here. Oh wait, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the vector field. So, ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector to the surface.

So maybe I can compute the surface integral instead of the volume integral, which might be easier since the field is radial. Let me think about the field. Since it's radial and falls off as 1/r², the field is f(r) = (some constant) * r̂ / r². Wait, the magnitude is given as 1/r², so the vector field would be f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, right? Because in spherical coordinates, the radial component is the only one, so f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

Now, applying the divergence theorem, the volume integral becomes the surface integral of f · n over the sphere of radius R. But on the surface of the sphere, the normal vector n is just r̂, so f · n is the radial component of f at radius R. Which would be (1/R²) * 1, because f(r=R) is (1/R²) r̂, and n is r̂. So f · n = 1/R².

The surface integral becomes ∫∫ (1/R²) dA over the sphere. Since the integrand is constant, it's just (1/R²) times the surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So 4πR² * (1/R²) = 4π. So the volume integral of the divergence is 4π.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The divergence of a radial vector field f(r) = F(r) r̂ is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² F(r)). Because in spherical coordinates, the divergence for a radially symmetric field (only r component) is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F(r)).

So F(r) here is 1/r². So substituting into the divergence formula: (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ].

Let me compute that. r² * (1/r²) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is (1/r²) * 0 = 0. Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at r=0?

But wait, that's confusing because earlier using the divergence theorem gave me 4π. So which one is correct?

Hmm, maybe the divergence is zero except at the origin, which is a point where the function isn't defined. So in the volume integral, we're integrating over the region r < R, but if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the volume integral would be... but wait, wait. Let me think again.

If the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral over any volume that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But in our case, the sphere of radius R is centered at the origin, so it does include the origin. So that complicates things because the divergence isn't just zero everywhere; it's singular at the origin.

Wait, so wait. Let me clarify. The divergence theorem says that the integral of ∇·f over a volume V is equal to the flux through the surface S of V. But when the vector field has a singularity (like at the origin here), the divergence theorem in its standard form applies only when the field is smooth everywhere inside V. So in this case, since f(r) has a singularity at r=0, maybe the divergence isn't just zero except at the point. So perhaps I should reconsider.

But earlier, using the surface integral approach, I found the volume integral equals 4π. So where am I making a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the divergence earlier. Let me recalculate.

F(r) is 1/r², so f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. The divergence of a radial vector field f(r) r̂ is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F(r)).

So substituting F(r) = 1/r², we get:

d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ] = d/dr [1] = 0. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where the function isn't defined. So ∇·f = 0 for all r ≠ 0.

But then, if the divergence is zero everywhere inside the volume except at the origin, the volume integral should be zero, right? Because the integral of zero over any region is zero.

But wait, that contradicts the earlier result from the divergence theorem, which gave 4π. So where's the confusion here?

Ah, wait, the divergence theorem accounts for the flux through the surface, which includes the contribution from any singularities inside the volume. So even though the divergence is zero everywhere else, the field has a point charge-like singularity at the origin, which contributes to the flux.

So let me think again. The vector field f(r) = (1/r²) r̂ is similar to the electric field of a point charge, which is f(r) = k Q / r² r̂. The divergence of such a field is zero except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r), I think. Because in electromagnetism, Gauss's law says that the divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0, which for a point charge is a delta function.

So if ∇·f = 4π δ³(r), then the volume integral over any volume that includes the origin would be 4π. Because the integral of delta function over all space is 1, so 4π times that would be 4π.

Therefore, the volume integral ∫ ∇·f dV inside the sphere of radius R would be 4π, regardless of R, as long as R > 0.

Wait, that makes sense. So the correct answer is 4π, which is option A.

So putting it all together, the steps are:

1. Recognize that the divergence of the vector field is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's a delta function.

2. Using the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface. 

3. Alternatively, since the divergence includes a delta function, the integral over any volume containing the origin is 4π.

So the answer should be A) 4π.


The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin. The vector field is radial, with a magnitude **f(r) = 1/r²**, and its divergence needs to be computed.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Divergence of the Vector Field**:  
   For a radial vector field **f(r) = F(r) \hat{r}**, the divergence in spherical coordinates is given by:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F(r) \right).
   \]  
   Substituting **F(r) = 1/r²**, we find:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr}(1) = 0.
   \]  
   Thus, the divergence is zero everywhere except at **r = 0**, where the field has a singularity.

2. **Divergence Theorem**:  
   The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary of the volume:  
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S (\mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n}) \, dA,
   \]  
   where **\mathbf{n}** is the outward normal vector to the surface. For the given vector field, the flux through the surface of the sphere is:  
   \[
   \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} = \frac{1}{R^2},
   \]  
   since **\mathbf{f} = (1/R²) \hat{r}** and **\mathbf{n} = \hat{r}** on the surface. The surface area of the sphere is **4πR²**, so the flux is:  
   \[
   \int_S (\mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n}) \, dA = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4πR^2 = 4π.
   \]

3. **Singularity at the Origin**:  
   The divergence is zero everywhere except at **r = 0**, where the field has a point-like singularity. In such cases, the divergence is proportional to the Dirac delta function, **∇ · f = 4π δ³(r)**. The volume integral of the divergence over any region containing the origin is therefore **4π**, regardless of the radius **R** of the sphere.

### Conclusion:
The volume integral of the divergence of the vector field inside the sphere of radius **R** is **4π**, which corresponds to option **A**.
