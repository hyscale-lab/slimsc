Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. Good, that's one variable less to worry about.

Alright, the star's given parameters are mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. But their masses are 7 and 5 Earth masses, but I think for equilibrium temperature, mass might not matter directly. Wait, equilibrium temperature is about energy balance, so maybe it's more about the planet's size because that affects how much energy it absorbs.

Wait, but the important thing here is probably the distance from the star. Because the RV and transit methods give information about the planet's orbit. Radial velocity gives the mass and the distance (through the Doppler shift), and transit gives the distance through the orbital period and star's size. But in this question, both methods have been used, but I'm not sure if I need to calculate the actual distances.

Wait, the question gives the Doppler shifts induced by each planet on the [OI] line. Oh, right, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. So the RV method measures the star's velocity shift, which depends on the planet's mass and the distance (or the semi-major axis, as it's circular). So each planet causes a certain Doppler shift, which should relate to their orbital velocities.

Oh wait, the RV shift is caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star, causing the star to move. The Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. So the star's velocity (v) can be calculated using the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) = v/c, where c is the speed of light. Wait, but the formula is a bit more precise. The Doppler formula is v = (Δλ / λ) * c. But sometimes, this is approximated as Δλ in Å over the wavelength.

So for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 Å at 6300 Å. So the velocity would be (0.03 / 6300) * c. Let me calculate that. c is about 3e5 km/s. So 0.03 / 6300 is approximately 4.76e-6. Multiply by 3e5 km/s gives around 1.43 km/s. So Planet1 causes a 1.43 km/s shift.

For Planet2, the shift is 0.04 Å. So 0.04 / 6300 = ~6.35e-6. Multiply by 3e5 km/s gives about 1.908 km/s. So Planet2 causes a 1.908 km/s shift.

But wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the star's velocity. The formula for K is (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) /
