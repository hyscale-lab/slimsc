Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. So I need to check each compound for the presence of such centers. Also, sometimes molecules can have other forms of asymmetry, like in allenes or certain bicyclic structures, but I think the main focus here is on chiral centers.

Let me list out the compounds one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:
Wait, this is a chloroalkene. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but with substituents. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl attached to a double bond. So, structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe I should draw it. Oh, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the structure ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So, it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, that's impossible because but-1-ene has four carbons, with the double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2
