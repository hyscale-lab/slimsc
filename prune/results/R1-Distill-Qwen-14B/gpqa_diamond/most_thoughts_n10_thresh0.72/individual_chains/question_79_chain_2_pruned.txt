Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about an experiment where compound X, with the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. They gave the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the product, and I need to identify what compound X was from the options given.

Hmm, wait a minute. The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Sharpless epoxidation is an oxidation reaction that forms epoxides from epoxide precursors, like dienes. So I think compound X must be an epoxide because the product after reaction with this reagent would be something else. Wait, no, wait—actually, the starting material is X, and the reagent is for epoxidation. Or wait, no, the reagent is used in epoxidation reactions. Oh wait, no, wait. Sharpless epoxidation is used to form epoxides from certain dienes. So if X is reacting with this reagent, perhaps X is a diene, and the product is an epoxide. Or maybe X is an epoxide and the reaction is something else. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let me look at the NMR data first.

The 1H NMR of the product:
δ 2.28 (3H, s) — probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe a carbonyl or an aromatic ring. But since it's a singlet, maybe it's attached to a carbon with no neighboring protons. Another singlet at δ 2.31 (3H, s) — another methyl group, possibly attached similarly.

Then, the aromatic region:
6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). That looks like a couple of sets of doublets. Maybe there's a coupling through two or more protons, suggesting an aromatic ring with substituents. Let me think: the pattern could be a para-substituted benzene with some substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted styrene or something similar.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:
δ 21.3 and 28.4 (each 1C, s). These are probably methyl groups. One is around δ21, which is typical for a methyl attached to an oxygen, like in an epoxide (since in epoxides, the adjacent carbons can be around 20-30 ppm). The other is at 28.4, which might be a methyl attached to a CH2 or something similar. Wait, but the compound X is C11H12O, and the product would have more oxygen? Or perhaps it's the same number of carbons but different arrangement.

Wait, the product's molecular formula isn't given, but perhaps X is the epoxide and the reaction is something else. Alternatively, the reaction is an epoxidation, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's think again. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a base used in epoxidation. So perhaps the starting compound X is a diene, and the reaction forms an epoxide. Wait, but the product's NMR shows an epoxide, perhaps. Alternatively, the product might be a diol, but no, the NMR doesn't suggest that.

Wait, the product's 13C NMR has a peak at δ197.7, which is a carbonyl carbon. That's a high value, perhaps a ketone. But wait, 197 ppm is more like an ester or a ketone. Wait, but epoxides don't have carbonyls. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's look again. The product's 13C NMR shows 21.3 and 28.4 as two single methyl carbons. The rest are in the aromatic and carbonyl regions. The 197.7 is a carbonyl, maybe a ketone, but in the product. So if the starting material X is an epoxide, maybe the reaction is some ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is opening an epoxide. Oh wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is often used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which forms epoxides. So perhaps the starting material X is a diene
