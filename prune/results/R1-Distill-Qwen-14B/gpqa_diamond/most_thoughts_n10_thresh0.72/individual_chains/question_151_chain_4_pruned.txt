Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Okay, so that's a vector in 3-dimensional space. I think in quantum mechanics, this would be a state vector, probably a column vector in Dirac notation. So the state vector |ψ> is:

|ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T

Wait, wait. No, wait, no, in Dirac notation, it's usually a column vector. So in this case, yes, it's a 3x1 matrix.

Then, there's an observable represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has its first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). So let me write that out:

P = [
    [0, 1/√2, 0],
    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
    [0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, okay. Observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, right? Because their eigenvalues are real, which makes sense for measurements. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of P should equal P. Looking at the elements, since all the elements are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let's transpose P:

Transpose of P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]

Wait, that's the same as P. So yes, P is Hermitian, which is good because it's an observable.

The question is to find the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0.

I remember that when you measure an observable in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one is zero. Then, the probability of getting zero is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state |ψ>.

Wait, but first, perhaps I should find the eigenvalues of P. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, then see which eigenvalue is zero, and compute the probability.

So let's find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me compute the determinant of (P - λ I):

The matrix (P - λ I) is:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ]

Hmm, determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let's compute it.

The determinant formula is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ].

Wait, because the third column's first element is 0, so that term will be zero.

So expanding along the first row:

det = -λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0.

Wait, no, correction: The cofactor expansion on the first row. The elements are:

a11 = -λ, a12 = 1/√2, a13 = 0.

So the determinant is:

a11 * M11 - a12 * M12 + a13 * M13,

where M11 is the minor for (1,1), M12 for (1,2), etc.

So,

det = (-λ) * det( [[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]] ) - (1/√2) * det( [[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]] ) + 0 * det(...)

So let's compute each minor.

First minor M11:

det( [[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

Second minor M12:

det( [[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ]) = (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/(√2).

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ/(√2) )

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ)/2.

Second term: - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ*(1/(√2 * √2)) )= λ*(1/2).

So the determinant becomes:

(-λ^3 + λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

So the characteristic equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0

Factor this equation:

λ(-λ² + 1) = 0 → λ (1 - λ²) )= 0.

So the solutions are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

Wait, because 1 - λ² = 0 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, the determinant equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0, which is equivalent to λ^3 - λ = 0 → λ(λ² -1 )=0 → so λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1. Yes, correct.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but when we measure an observable, the possible results are the eigenvalues. So possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

So the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 in the state |ψ>.

So I need to find the eigenvector(s) for λ=0, then project |ψ> onto that eigenvector and find the square of its norm.

Alternatively, since P is a Hermitian operator, the eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. So first, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

Let me start with λ=0.

We have (P - 0 I)|v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

So the system of equations from P |v> = 0 is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1) v2 = 0 → v2 =0.

(1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → same as first equation, v2=0.

So from equation (1), v2=0. From equation (2), v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0, v1 = -v3. Let's set v3 = t, then v1 = -t, v2=0.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (-1, 0, 1). Or any scalar multiple. So the normalized eigenvector would be (1/√2)(-1, 0, 1), since the norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +0 +1^2 ) = sqrt(2), so 1/√2 times that gives a unit vector.

So the eigenvector |e0> corresponding to λ=0 is (1/√2)(-1, 0, 1)^T.

Wait, wait, because (v1, v2, v3) = (-t, 0, t), so when t=1, it's (-
