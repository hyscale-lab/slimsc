Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound is made up of five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and then they sequenced the target gene in all mutants. The changes are in the beginning of the sequence in the first exon area.

The question is asking which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The options are Mutant 1 to 4, and the choices are A to D.

I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so any mutation in the exons could potentially change the protein product. Since the compound is anti-nutritional, perhaps disrupting the gene (so it doesn't produce the compound) would be beneficial. So, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a premature stop codon or an amino acid change that makes the protein nonfunctional.

Looking at the sequences, I need to compare the intact gene with each mutant to see where the changes are and what they mean.

The intact gene is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let's break down each mutant.

Starting with Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, let's look at the beginning. The first few nucleotides: the intact is ATGTTTCTCG...

Mutant 1 has ATGTTCTACG. Wait, so let me write the first parts:

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TT... Wait, maybe I need to line them up.

Wait, maybe the first part is:

Looking at the first part, the intact is:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant 1 is:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TT...

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the differences. Let's see:

Looking at each position:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Looking at the initial part:

Intact starts: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, let's see from the start. The first 10 nucleotides:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCG
Mutant1:
