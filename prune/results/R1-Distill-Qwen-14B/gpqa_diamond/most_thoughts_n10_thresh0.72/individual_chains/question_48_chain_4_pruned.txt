Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Let's break down each step to figure out what the final product (product 4) looks like, and then determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms it has.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. I remember that when ketones react with bromine (Br2), it's usually a bromination. But wait, where does the bromine add? Oh right, ketones can undergo a halogenation via the enol mechanism. So, cyclohexanone would form a bromocyclohexanone. Wait, but more specifically, the bromine adds to the carbonyl group. Oh wait, no, maybe it's a different mechanism. Alternatively, I think ketones can undergo the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's with peracids. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, another possibility is that when cyclohexanone is treated with Br2 in a non-polar solvent, it might undergo a ring-opening addition. Or wait, maybe it's a dihydroxylation? No, dihydroxylation is with something else, like OsO4 or H2O2. Or maybe it's an alpha bromination.

Wait, alpha bromination for ketones. Oh yeah, when ketones are treated with bromine in the presence of a base, it's an example of the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, which adds a bromine to the alpha carbon. But wait, no, the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii is for carboxylic acids, adding bromine to the alpha position. Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is adding directly to the carbonyl group. Oh wait, cyclohexanone reacting with Br2 in a condition that leads to the formation of a dibromide. Or maybe it's a dienophile? No, because there's no diene here.

Wait, another point: cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine to a ketone, I think it's a 1,2-addition. So the bromine would add to
