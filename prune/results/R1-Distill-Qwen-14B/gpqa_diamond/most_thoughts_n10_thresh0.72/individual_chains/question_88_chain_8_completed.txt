Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this immune system question. Let's see what the question is about. 

So, the scenario is that someone tagged rotavirus's inner capsid proteins with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, they used in vivo imaging and noticed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus. They identified Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is, which process is happening?

Hmm. I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses, especially to oral antigens, occur. They contain a lot of B cells and other immune cells. 

So, the GFP-tagged proteins are probably acting as antigens. When they're given orally, they might get processed and presented to the immune system. The fact that some were destroyed by stomach acid but others made it suggests that maybe not all antigens are processed the same way. But the key part is that the fluorescent Peyer patches were identified, and when they looked at the cells there, their variable heavy chains were highly variable.

I think about immune responses. When an antigen is presented, B cells in the lymphoid tissues take them up. Once they are activated (usually by an antigen presenting cell and possibly a T cell helper), B cells undergo several processes. 

One of the processes is called somatic hypermutation. I remember that this occurs in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. Somatic hypermutation introduces mutations into the B cell's antibody genes, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. This process happens after the B cell is activated, leading to a more specific and stronger immune response. The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences suggests that this might be happening because each B cell is making slightly different antibodies.

The other options: complement activation is about the complement system attacking pathogens, not directly about B cell diversity. Class switching is about changing the type of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but that doesn't explain the variability in the sequences. VDJ recombination is during the early stages of B cell development, when the variable, diversity, and joining segments are combined to form the initial antibody repertoire. But that happens during maturation in the bone marrow, not after antigen exposure. 

So, the process that leads to high variability after the initial exposure and during the immune response is somatic hypermutation. That must be the answer.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. The experiment observes that some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus, but fluorescent Peyer patches are identified. Isolating the proliferating cell population from these patches reveals high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences. This suggests a process that increases antibody diversity after antigen exposure.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) and are key sites for immune responses to oral antigens. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes indicates that a process occurring in these patches is responsible for generating diverse antibody repertoires. Among the options:

- **Somatic hypermutation** is a process that introduces mutations into the antibody genes of activated B cells in germinal centers, increasing diversity. This matches the observed variability in the variable heavy chain sequences.
- **Complement activation** involves the complement system attacking pathogens and is unrelated to antibody diversity.
- **Class switching recombination** changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not explain the variability in the sequences.
- **VDJ recombination** occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, forming the initial antibody repertoire, not after antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after antigen activation and leads to increased antibody diversity. 

Answer: A
