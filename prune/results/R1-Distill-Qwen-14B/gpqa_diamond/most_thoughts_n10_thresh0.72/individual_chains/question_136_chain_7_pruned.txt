Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with divergence and all that. But let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. We need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Hmm, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. If the divergence is zero, it means the field is incompressible. But wait, this field isn't zero; it's 1/r² radially outward. So, what's the divergence of such a field?

Wait, I think about the divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field that only has a radial component, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r), where A_r is the radial component. Since f(r) is along the radial direction, let me write that down.

The vector field f(r) can be written as f(r) r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector. So, A_r = f(r) = 1/r².

So, the divergence ∇·f would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ). Let me compute that. The term inside the derivative is r² * (1/r²) = 1. So, the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Oh wait, so that would make the divergence zero? But wait, that can't be right because I remember something about point charges and Gauss's law.

Wait, another thought: Oh wait, this is similar to the electric field of a point charge. The electric field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) r̂. The divergence of E is zero everywhere except at r=0. But when you integrate the divergence over a volume that includes the origin, there's a delta function or something involved. So maybe the integral isn't zero after all.

Wait, but how does that connect to our problem here? Because the original problem is about the volume integral of the divergence. So, if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then
