Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by recalling some concepts.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can move freely. So, the presence of charge q will induce charges on the sphere. But wait, since it's grounded, the sphere's potential is zero. Oh right, because grounding means it's connected to the Earth, which is at zero potential.

Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would flow to the ground. So, initially, the sphere has no net charge, but when charge q is placed near it, the sphere's charges will redistribute. Oh wait, no. Wait, when a conductor is grounded, any induced charge that's on it can leave through the ground. So, for a conducting sphere, when you bring a charge near it, the sphere's free charges move, but because it's grounded, they can leave. Hmm, but wait, maybe not. Maybe the sphere acts as a conductor, so the charges on it will redistribute, but since it's connected to ground, the net charge remains zero because any induced charges can flow away.

Wait
