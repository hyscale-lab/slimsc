Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about the decay of a particle in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, so I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be affected by their velocity relative to the observer. Because of time dilation, moving particles appear to live longer from our frame of reference. The formula for the lifetime observed (τ) is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = E / (m c²), right? Since energy E is given, and mass m is provided. Wait, but units are in GeV. Oh, but when using E and m, we have to make sure the units are consistent. Since E is in GeV and m is also in GeV (as mass-energy equivalence), I think the calculation would involve just E / m.

So let's compute γ first. E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41... Well, 3.41 times 7 is around 23.87, and 3.41 times 8 is approximately 27.28. So 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. Let me compute accurately: 3.41 * 7.917? Hmm, maybe a calculator would help, but perhaps it's easier to just approximate.

Wait, 3.41 * 8 is 27.28, which is larger than 27. So 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let me compute 3.41 * 7.91: 3.41 *7 is 23.87, 3.41 *0.91 is approximately 3.1031. Adding them gives 23.87 +3.1031 = 26.9731, which is just under 27. So 7.91 is a good approximation. So γ ≈7.91.

Now, the observed lifetime τ is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that: 7.91 *8 is 63.28, so τ ≈63.28e-16 seconds, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should use the exact mass value. Let me double-check the numbers: X⁰ mass is 3.41 GeV, energy E is 27 GeV. So yes, E is much larger than m, so γ is indeed about 7.91.

Now, the next part is figuring out the minimum resolution needed. I think resolution in this context refers to the precision of the detector's measurement, specifically the proper length over which the decay products are detected. But wait, perhaps it's the minimum length the particle has to travel before decaying so that the decay can be observed.

Wait, the minimum resolution would be the minimum distance the particle travels during its lifetime (as observed in the lab frame) multiplied by how much of the decays we can capture. Oh, right, because not all particles will decay in the chamber; the problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, no. Wait,
