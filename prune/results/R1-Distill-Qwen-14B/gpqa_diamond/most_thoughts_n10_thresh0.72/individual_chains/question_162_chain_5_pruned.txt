Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy, and there's no dz term. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid, which is the universal cover of a hyperbolic space.

So, the metric might be representing a hyperbolic space. Now, the area of a pseudosphere with radius r. Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which is a pseudosphere in 2D) is given by 2πr * (1 - cos θ), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, the metric looks a bit like the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk model has a metric of the form ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. But the given metric here is in terms of x and y, so maybe it's similar. Let me compare the two.

In the Poincaré disk model, the line element is ds² =
