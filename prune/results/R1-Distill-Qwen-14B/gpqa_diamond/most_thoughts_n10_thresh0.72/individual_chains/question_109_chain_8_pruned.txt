Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so it's about two nucleons emitting a particle and the conservation laws involved. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The initial state is a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. So, the notation 1S0 tells me something about their spin, orbital angular momentum, and total angular momentum. Wait, the problem says the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). Oh right, so for 1S0, that means 2S+1=1 → S=0. So the total spin is zero. L is S here, so L is 0 because it's S. And J is 0. So the initial state is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum 0.

They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1. Now, the reaction is something like NN → NN' + X, but the problem is more about the outgoing states. Wait, actually, the problem is about the possible partial waves in the decay. So the question is about the allowed partial waves for the emitted particle, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

The condition given is Pauli statistics requiring that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused. T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. Oh, but wait, in the problem statement, it's the quantum numbers of the final NN state that must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Hmm, but I think for Pauli's exclusion principle, the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The wavefunction includes spatial, spin, and isospin parts. So the product of these must be antisymmetric. So when you have identical particles (like the two nucleons in the final state), the total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts. The overall symmetry depends on the product of symmetries of each part.

The Pauli exclusion says that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So if the two nucleons are in a symmetric spatial wavefunction, their spin and isospin parts must be antisymmetric, and vice versa. So for the final state, T(NN)=0. Wait, T is the isospin. So if T=0, that's symmetric or antisymmetric? Wait, isospin is a vector, and the combination T=0 is symmetric under exchange because the singlet state is symmetric. Or wait, maybe that's not quite right. Let's think: the singlet state is symmetric because swapping the particles, you get the same state. So for T=0, the isospin part is symmetric.

So the final NN state has T=0. So the isospin part is symmetric. The spatial part is the orbital angular momentum part, which is a symmetric or antisymmetric state depending on L. Spin S is the total spin of the NN. So the spin part is symmetric if S is even (like S=0, 2, ...) and antisymmetric if S is odd. Wait, because the spin state for two particles: when you swap them, the spin state with total S will pick up (-1)^{2S} factor, because each spinor (if half-integer) would contribute a factor. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, I think the exchange of two identical particles in the spin part: if the total spin S is even (like S=0, which is symmetric; S=2, which is symmetric because (2S+1) is 5, which is odd number of states?), or wait, no. Wait, each exchange of two spin-1/2 particles, for a given total spin S, the exchange is (-1)^{2S} times the original state. Since 2S is even, it's symmetric? Wait, no, because 2S is even, so
