Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, does that mean their actual number is the same throughout space, or that their density is uniform? I think it means their density is uniform, so there's the same number of stars in each cubic parsec, no matter where you look.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, if I have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars in that range depend on plx?

Wait, maybe I should think about how many stars are in a certain volume as parallax changes. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So the distance increases as plx decreases.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd would be 4πd² dd. Because the volume between d and d+dd is the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness (dd).

But since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that in. So the volume is 4π*(1/plx)^2 * (dplx). Hmm, wait, because dd is the change in distance, and dplx is the change in parallax. So how are d and dplx related? Since d = 1/plx, taking derivative: dd = -dplx / plx². So d = 1/plx → dplx = - plx² dd.

Wait, but I'm dealing with positive quantities here. Let me think again. So, for a small change in parallax dplx, the corresponding change in distance dd is negative because as plx decreases, distance increases. So maybe I should relate the differential elements.

Let me consider that d is distance, plx is 1/d. So plx varies from plx to plx + dplx, which would correspond to d varying from d to d + dd. But since pl
