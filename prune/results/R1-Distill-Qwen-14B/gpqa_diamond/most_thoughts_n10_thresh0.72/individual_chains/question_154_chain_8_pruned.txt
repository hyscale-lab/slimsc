Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. The options are four different compounds, each with some sort of chloro and maybe a functional group like acid or aldehyde. 

First, let's look at the mass data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and there's another peak at 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, a molecular ion usually indicates the molecular weight. So the molecular formula must have a molecular weight around 156. The other peak at 158 is a bit higher. Maybe it's a fragment or an isotope? Wait, but if the molecular ion is at 156, then 158 could be a doublet due to something like chlorine isotopes. Chlorine has a molecular weight of about 35.5, so each Cl atom contributes about 35. So if there's Cl in the molecule, we might see peaks that are 2 m/z apart because Cl has a common isotope (35Cl and 37Cl). So the molecular ion at 156 could be the lower isotope (with more 35Cl?), but wait, wait. The molecular weight is 156, so the formula probably includes Cl. Let me think about the formulas of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: (12*7)+(5*1)+(35.5)+(16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Hmm, close to 156. Oh, but m/z is 156. So perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, but if the actual formula is 156.5, maybe the mass is approximated. But the other peak is at 158, which would come from the Cl isotope. So that fits. 

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: same as option A, 156.5. So same idea here. So the molecular ion would be around 156, and a peak at 158 for the Cl isotopes.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The formula is C6H5COCl. Let's see: C7H5ClO. So molecular weight would be (7*12)+(5*1)+35.5 +16 = 84 +5 +35.5 +16= 140.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. So this doesn't fit. So option C is probably not correct.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as option B? No, wait, 2-chloro would have same formula: C7H5ClO2. So same molecular weight as B and A. So all three options A, B, D have the same molecular formula but different structures.

Wait, but the molecular weight for option C is lower, so it's out because the molecular ion is 156. So options are probably among A, B, D.

Next, looking at the IR data. The IR shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR often indicate O-H stretching. For example, in alcohols, carboxylic acids, or phenols. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So what functional groups have that? Maybe a carboxylic acid (which has a broad O-H and a strong C=O), or an aldehyde (but aldehyde C=O is usually around 1700 cm^-1 as well). Alternatively, could it be an ester or something else? Let's think.

So, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, and the C=O would be around 1700. But sometimes, the C=O can be a bit higher, depending on the substituents. So that fits with options B and D, which are benzoic acids. Option A is a benzaldehyde with a hydroxy group, so C=O would be from the aldehyde. Wait, aldehyde C=O is generally a little higher, around 1720 cm^-1, so that also fits. But the IR also has a broad peak, which is from O-H. So if it's an aldehyde, where would the O-H come from? Option A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a hydroxyl group (phenolic) and an aldehyde group. So the O-H would show up as a broad peak, and the aldehyde's C=O would be sharp. That fits.

Wait, but for a carboxylic acid, the -COOH group has a broad O-H stretch (because it's acidic and can form hydrogen bonds), and the C=O is strong. So in the IR, the presence of both a broad O-H and a strong C=O suggests a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, phenol would have O-H but without a C=O. So if the C=O is present, then it's either an aldehyde, ketone, ester, or acid.

Wait, also the aldehyde group would have a C=O peak around 1720, which matches the IR. But the aldehyde also has a peak from the aldehyde H (around 9-10 ppm in NMR), which I'll check in the NMR data.

Looking at the NMR data: 

1H NMR shows:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H)

8.02 ppm (d, 2H)

7.72 (d, 2H)

So, 11 ppm is a singlet. That's very high for a proton. Common protons at that region are aldehydic (around 9-10 ppm), or acidic protons like from a carboxylic acid (which can be around 10-12 ppm). Wait, but in the case of a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But in the NMR here, it's a singlet. For a carboxylic acid, the proton exchange might cause it to appear as a broad peak, but sometimes it can be a sharp singlet if it's exchanging slowly or in a certain environment. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is usually a sharp singlet around 9-10 ppm, but this is at 11.0, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility is that the 11 ppm is from an acidic proton, such as in a phenol. But phenol protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, unless it's a very strong acid. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl oxygen adjacent to the proton? Or perhaps a conjugated system making the proton more deshielded.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That looks like a pair of doublets, each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons on each side are equivalent, leading to two doublets each integrating for 2H. So the substituents are probably in the para positions relative to each other.

So considering all the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The structure would be
