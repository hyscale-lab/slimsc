Okay, so I've got this problem here about an algorithm that converts DNA sequences into numbers. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA ->176. I need to find out what ACAGTGACC gives. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I should look for a pattern or a rule that the algorithm is applying. The output is a number, so maybe each nucleotide is being converted into a digit or a number in some way.

Looking at the first example: AGG. So that's three nucleotides. The output is 115. Let me think about each letter. A, G, G. Maybe each letter corresponds to a number. Wait, A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4? Or another order?

Wait, let's think about their positions in the DNA alphabet. Adenine (A) is first, Thymine (T) second, Cytosine (C) third, Guanine (G) fourth. So A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4.

So for AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. If I add them up, 1 +4 +4 =9. But the output is 115. That doesn't match. So maybe it's not just summing. Alternatively, perhaps each letter is converted to a number and then concatenated.

So AGG would be 1,4,4. Concatenated, that's 144. But the output is 115. Hmm, not matching. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's the reverse. Looking at the first example: 115. So maybe each letter is converted to a number, and then multiplied or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's using the position in the sequence in some way. Let's consider the positions of each nucleotide. For AGG: positions 1,2,3. So A is 1 at position 1, G (4) at position 2, G (4) at position 3.

Another approach: Maybe the algorithm converts each nucleotide into a specific number and then sums them, but with some other factor. For example, maybe each position is multiplied by a certain weight.

Wait, the output for AGG is 115. Let's see: 1 (A) + something (G) + something (G
