Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax plx is 1 over distance in parsecs. So if distance r increases, parallax decreases.

The number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r (because r is in parsecs, I think), that would make plx = 1/r. So substituting that into N, I get N = k * (r)^5, where k is some constant. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh right, so it's the change in number per unit distance. So maybe I need to think about the derivative of N with respect to r.

Let me think. If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5r^4. But wait, the question says "how does the number... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So I think they're looking for the rate of change, which would relate to the derivative dN/dr.

But wait, the options are about how N changes with r, not the derivative. Let me read the question again. Oh, no, the question says "how does the number of stars [...] change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be proportional to something. Because when you go from a certain distance to a slightly larger one, how many stars are there in that small slice.

Hmm, I think the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr is proportional to r^2 (since the surface area of a sphere is 4πr²) multiplied by some factor. But in this case, the number isn't just proportional to r squared but depends on the parallax.

Wait, the question states that the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5. So for each star, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, 1/plx is r, so 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N = k * r^5.

But wait, the number of stars isn't just a function of distance, but also the volume or the area. Oh, wait no, maybe the region is a specific area, so the number per unit area. Or perhaps it's the number density.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap. The problem says that N ∝ 1/plx^5. And since plx = 1/r (parallax in arcseconds, r in parsecs), then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars in that region increases with r^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then for a given increase in r, the number increases by r^5.

Wait, but the options are about the dependence. So N is proportional to r^
