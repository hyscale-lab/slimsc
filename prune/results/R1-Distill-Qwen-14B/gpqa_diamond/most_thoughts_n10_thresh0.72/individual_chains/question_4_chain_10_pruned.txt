Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both North and South poles; you can't isolate them. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Let me recall what Maxwell's equations are. There are four of them, right? The first one is about the divergence of the electric field, Gauss's law. It states that electric flux through a closed surface equals the charge enclosed. The second is Gauss's law for magnetism, which says that the divergence of B is zero—so no isolated magnetic charges, like monopoles. Then there's Faraday's law of induction, which involves the curl of the electric field. And finally, Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition for the curl of the magnetic field.

So in our world, the divergence of B is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. That is equation number two: ∇·B = 0. If in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated North or South poles, that would mean magnetic monopoles exist. So equation two must change.

Wait, but what about the other equations? Let's think. Faraday's law, equation three, deals with changing magnetic fields and the curl of E. I don't think that would change because it's about how changing B fields create E fields, which is unrelated to monopoles. Similarly, Ampère's law, equation four, deals with the curl of B and relates it to current and displacement current. That also shouldn't be directly affected by the existence of monopoles, unless there's a change in how current is defined, but I don't think so.

Wait, but wait. If magnetic monopoles exist, how does that affect Maxwell's equations? Let me think again. The existence of magnetic charge would mean that the divergence of B isn't zero anymore. Instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So equation two would change from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.

What about the other equations? Faraday's law (equation three) relates the curl of E to the negative rate of change of B. If B can have sources (monopoles), does that affect Faraday's law? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe not directly. Faraday's law is about changing B fields inducing E fields, which doesn't directly involve the sources of B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maxwell's equations are symmetric when magnetic monopoles are introduced. In the presence of magnetic charges, the equations become more symmetric. Oh right, so if magnetic monopoles exist, then equation one (Gauss's law for E) would have a similar form as equation two. Like, ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ and ∇·B = ρ_m / something.

But in the question, what's changing? The question says Maxwell's equations look different. So the two equations that involve charge and current would now include magnetic charge and current as well.

Wait, no, the question is specifically about which equations are different. So in our universe, ∇·B = 0. In a universe with monopoles, it's ∇·B = something. So equation two definitely changes.

What about Ampère's law? Ampère's law in our universe is ∇ × B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). If magnetic current exists, perhaps there's an additional term in Ampère's law. But I'm not certain. Wait, I remember that if magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations become more symmetric, so both the divergence of E and divergence of B have sources. And both the curl of E and curl of B have certain terms.

Wait, another thought: without monopoles, the divergence of B is zero. So equation two is different. Also, what about Faraday's law? Faraday's law is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. If there's a magnetic current, does that introduce a term in Faraday's law? Or perhaps does it affect the equation
