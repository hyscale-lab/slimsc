Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy of the setup is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I think I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when particles are moving, their lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy.

Right, so gamma (γ) = E / (m c²). Oh wait, but E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. Since we're probably working in units where c=1 (like natural units), E is just gamma m. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 times 7.9 is approximately 27.0? Because 3.41*7=23.87, 3.41*0.9=3.069, so 23.87+3.069=26.939. So approximately 7.9. So γ is about 7.9.

So the observed lifetime τ = γ τ₀ = 7.9 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that.

7.9 *8 is 63.2, so 63.2e-16 s. So τ is 6.32e-15 seconds or 6.32×10⁻¹⁵ s.

Now, I need to find the minimum resolution. Wait, what's resolution in this context? Oh right, I think it refers to the minimum distance (length) that the bubble chamber can distinguish
