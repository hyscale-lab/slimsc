Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and the quantum numbers involved. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X. The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, I remember that when particles are identical fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So the product of spin, spatial, and other symmetry factors must be antisymmetric.

The initial state is 1S0, which I think means the spin is S=0 (since the S in 2S+1 notation is 0, giving S= (1-1)/2=0). The orbital angular momentum L is 0 because it's an S state. So the initial total angular momentum J is 0 (since J = L + S, but L=0 and S=0, so J=0).

The initial state has T=0? Or wait, wait. Wait, the problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So after emission, the isospin is 0. So the isospin of the initial state must be whatever it was, but the final must be 0. But perhaps the isospin part is about the product of the initial T and the emitted particle's isospin, but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the angular momentum and parity aspects.

The problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are all 1S0 -> something plus a particle. So let's look at each option and see if the quantum numbers work.

The initial state is 1S0, so J=0, L=0, S=0. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So I think that parity has to be considered for the overall process.

Pauli's exclusion principle says that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric for identical fermions. So the emitted particle is X, but wait, the NN are identical particles, and X is another particle. Wait, in this case, the system is
