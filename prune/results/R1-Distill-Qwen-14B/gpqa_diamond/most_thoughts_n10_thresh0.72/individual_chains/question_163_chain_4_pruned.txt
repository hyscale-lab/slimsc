Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down. 

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a monobasic strong acid. I need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a pH and a volume. 

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and when it reacts with an acid, it should undergo a neutralization reaction. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, it's probably something like HCl, HNO3, or similar. The reaction would produce water, the corresponding salt, and release the conjugate base of the acid, which in this case would be the anion of the acid. 

So the reaction should look something like this: Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe³+ + H2O. But wait, actually, the stoichiometry might be more precise. Let's write the balanced equation. 

Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+ (from the acid) to produce Fe³+ and water. The balanced equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. That makes sense because each Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, each requiring an H+ to neutralize. 

Now, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are present. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Let's calculate that. 

Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is 17.01 g/mol (16.00 for O, 1.01 for H). So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol. 

The mass given is 0.1 grams. So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let's say approximately 9.36 x 10^-4 moles. 

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ (because of the balanced equation), the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles. 

The acid used is 0.1 M (molarity). Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.1 M is 0.1 moles per 0.001 m³ (since 1 m³ is 1000 liters, 0.1 m³ is 100 liters, but wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, 0.1 M is 0.1 moles per liter. So, to find the volume of acid solution needed, we use the formula: M1V1 = M2V2. Wait, no, actually, it's moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So the volume needed would be moles of H+ / molarity of acid. 

So, moles H+ needed is 0.002808. Molarity of acid is 0.1 M. So volume (in liters) = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. 

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close to my calculation. So the volume part probably points to option C. 

But wait, the question also asks for the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm. So after dissolving Fe(OH)3 in the acid, the solution would be a solution of Fe³+ ions, which is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base (since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base). So the solution should be acidic. 

The pH would depend on the concentration of Fe³+ ions and their hydrolysis. I remember that for such salts, the solution can be acidic because the cation (Fe³+) can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions. 

So, first, I need to find the concentration of Fe³+ in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The moles of Fe³+ are the same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 moles. 

Concentration of Fe³+ is moles / volume (L) = 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M. 

Wait, no. Wait, the total solution is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L. So 0.000936 moles in 0.1 L gives 0.00936 M Fe³+.

But wait, the acid added is 28.08 cm³ (from earlier calculation), and the total solution volume is 100 cm³. Wait, the acid is added to 100 cm³ of solution, but the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. Or wait, maybe the initial solution is 100 cm³, and we add the
