Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these things. But let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The question says that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

First, I need to figure out what each compound looks like and how their NMR spectra would appear.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14: Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. Benzene rings contribute 4 (since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds), so each compound must have one benzene ring and maybe some substituents.

Looking at the options, all are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's think about each structure.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That's four methyl groups on the benzene ring at positions 1,2,3,4. So it's like 1,2,3,4-tetra-methyl. Alternatively, if the ring is numbered differently, but I think that's correct. The structure would have four methyl groups in a row, making a sort of para arrangement? Wait, 1,2,3,4 are adjacent positions, so it's actually a 1,4-disubstituted ring but with four methyl groups. Wait no, 1,2,3,4 are four consecutive positions on the benzene ring.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. So positions 1,2,4,5. That leaves positions 3 and 6 empty. So the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. Hmm, that's adjacent in some places. Like 1 and 2 are next to each other, then 4 and 5 are next to each other as well. So it's two pairs of adjacent methyl groups across the ring.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's check each compound's formula.

Wait, each compound is C10H14. Let me calculate the molecular formula for each option. For a benzene ring with four methyl groups: C6H6 + 4*(CH3) â†’ C10H10. Wait, but
