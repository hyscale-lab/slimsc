Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such setups often involves the interaction between charges and the potentials they create.

Alright, let's break down the problem. There's a conducting sphere with radius R, and it's grounded. So, grounding means that any excess charge on the sphere will go into the ground, right? Wait, but if the sphere is conducting, any external charge should induce charges on the sphere. But since it's grounded, the induced charges can move to the ground. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, if a conducting sphere is grounded, it's at zero potential. So any charges on it would be able to leave, but if another charge is near it, maybe it'll induce charges.

Wait, the setup: a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of the sphere. So I imagine the sphere is neutral initially because it's grounded. When the charge q is placed nearby, the sphere will have induced charges. Let me think about that. The charge q would cause the sphere to have induced chargesâ€”positive and negative, right? Because the conducting sphere is neutral, but the external charge q will polarize it.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can't stay on the sphere. Or wait, no. Grounding allows the sphere to maintain a zero potential. So when
