Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is about finding the energy at which the lifetime of these gamma-rays is limited by this process. Hmm, I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, they can annihilate each other, producing electron-positron pairs. 

The reaction given is γγ → e⁺e⁻. I think this is a process where a high-energy gamma (let's say from a gamma-ray burst or something) interacts with a low-energy CMB photon. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV, which is pretty low, as expected because the CMB is microwave radiation.

So, the problem is about the lifetime of these gamma-rays. I recall that the lifetime is limited by the interaction time due to this annihilation process. The idea is that if the gamma-ray has enough energy, it will interact with the CMB photons frequently, leading to a shorter mean lifetime. The energy where the interaction time becomes significant compared to the age of the universe would be the threshold.

I think the key here is to calculate the energy where the mean free path (the average distance a gamma-ray travels before annihilating) becomes comparable to the size of the universe. But wait, the size of the universe is roughly the age of the universe multiplied by the speed of light. The age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, so the size is on the order of 10^26 meters or something like that.

Alternatively, I remember that the interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the density of the target photons. The cross-section for pair production (like this annihilation) is probably proportional to some power of the energy. Let me think, for photon-photon interactions, the cross-section σ is proportional to (E²)/(m_e^4), but I'm not entirely certain. Wait, I think the cross-section for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is something like σ ~ (E²)/(m_e^2 c^4), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps σ is proportional to (E)^2? Because higher energy photons are more likely to have enough energy to create the pair, so the cross-section increases with energy squared.

The mean free time τ is the inverse of the interaction rate Γ. The interaction rate is Γ = nσv, where n
