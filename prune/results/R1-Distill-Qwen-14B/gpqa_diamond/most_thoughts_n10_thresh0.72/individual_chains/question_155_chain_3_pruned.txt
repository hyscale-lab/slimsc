Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2). Wait, or is it (−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2)? Let me check. Oh yeah, that's the state vector.

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That might be important because the matrix elements in this basis would be easier to handle, maybe.

First, I need to compute <P_z>. Since the state is already an eigenstate of P_x, but the operator P_z is diagonal in this basis because the basis is its eigenbasis. Wait, no. Wait, the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z? Or is the basis the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is expressed in that basis?

Wait, the problem says: the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is written in terms of these basis vectors. So when the state is expressed in the P_z basis, the matrix of P_z is diagonal. Because each basis vector is an eigenvector of P_z.

Wait, but the given state is an eigenstate of P_x. So in the P_z basis, the state is a superposition of the P_z eigenstates.

So to compute <P_z>, I can take the state vector, multiply by P_z, and then take the inner product. Alternatively, since the state is expressed in the P_z basis, the expectation value <P_z> is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait: the state given is in the P_z basis, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component of the state vector corresponds to the
