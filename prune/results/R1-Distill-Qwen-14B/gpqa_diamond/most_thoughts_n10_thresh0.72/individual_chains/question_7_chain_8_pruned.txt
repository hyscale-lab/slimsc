Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetimes in the universe would be limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the range of 1e4 to 3.9e5 GeV, which is really high energy.

Wait, I remember that when particles interact, their interaction rate depends on their cross-section and the density of the target particles. For gamma-rays, the primary interaction here is pair production—when two photons collide and produce an electron-positron pair. The process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. 

I think the key here is to find the energy where the mean free path of the gamma-ray becomes comparable to the size of the universe, which would limit their lifetime. The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before interacting. If the mean free path is smaller than the universe's size, the gamma-rays would annihilate quickly, so their lifetime is limited.

The cross-section for this process probably depends on the energy of the gamma-rays. I recall that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs increases with the center-of-mass energy. The threshold energy for this process is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the rest mass of the electron, which is about 1.02 MeV. But the question is about high-energy gamma-rays, so they're way above that threshold.

The cross-section σ for γγ → e+ e- is given by some formula. I think the cross-section is proportional to the square of the logarithm of the energy or something like that. Alternatively, it might involve the square of the energy divided by some higher power because at high energies, the cross-section increases but probably with a certain dependency.

Wait, I think the cross-section for this process at high energies (E >> m_e c²) is approximately σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / (s)), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Or wait, maybe it's σ ≈ (8π/3) (α² / (s)) ) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind: the cross-section σ ≈ (8π/3) (α²/(4E_cm^2)) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dependence.

Alternatively, maybe the cross-section is proportional to 1/E^2 or something else. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the photon-photon interaction rate. The interaction rate Γ for a photon is given by the product of the cross-section σ and the number density n of the target photons. 

The number density n of CMB photons can be calculated. The CMB has a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of about 2.7 K. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, but the actual energy distribution is a blackbody spectrum. The number density can be found using the formula for blackbody radiation: n = (8π g_s)/( (2πħc)^3 ) * (k_B T)^3, where g_s is the statistical weight. For photons, g_s is 2 (since they're massless and have two polarizations), so n ≈ 8π/( (2πħc)^3 ) * (k_B T)^3 * (1/2) )? Wait, maybe I should recall the approximate value of the photon density. 

I remember that the energy density u of CMB is about 1e-4 erg/cm³ or 1e-14 J/m³. Wait, but the number density n is u divided by the average photon energy. Since the average energy is ~1e-3 eV, which is 1.6e-16 J. So if u is about 1e-14 J/m³, then n ≈ u/( average energy ) = 1e-14 / 1.6e-16 ≈ 62.5 per
