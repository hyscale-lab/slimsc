Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. I remember equilibrium temperature has to do with the balance between the energy a planet absorbs and emits. The question mentions five planets in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Oh right, and they used the TTV method to discover them, but I think that's just a detail about how they were found, maybe not relevant to the temperature calculation.

The planets are in orbital resonance, so their orbital periods are in a ratio. The key thing here is to find the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, so that probably cancels out in the equation.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is given by the formula:

T = T_star * ( ( L / (16 * π^2 * σ * a^2) ) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is T = T_eff * sqrt( R_* / (2a) ) ), where R_* is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and T_eff is the star's effective temperature. Alternatively, another version I recall is T = ( L / (16 π σ a² (1 - A) ) )^(1/4 ), where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, and a is the orbital radius. Since all planets have the same albedo, A is the same, so it will cancel when taking the ratio.

Wait, the problem says same albedo, so A is the same for both. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the inverse square root of the square of their orbital distances. Alternatively, since T is proportional to ( (L / (a²)) )^(1/4 ), but L is the same for all planets (same star, I suppose?), so the ratio should be (a2 / a4)^(1/2) ?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [(L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ a²)]^(1/4). So if L, σ, and A are constants, then T is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of a.

So if I have two planets, Planet 2 and Planet 4, their equilibrium temperatures would be T2 and T4. The ratio T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2). Because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so if a4 is larger than a2, T4 would be smaller.

Wait, no. Wait, if a planet is farther from the star (larger a), it's colder. So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 is for a4, and T2 is for a2. So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) because T scales as 1/sqrt(a).

Yes, that makes sense. So the ratio
