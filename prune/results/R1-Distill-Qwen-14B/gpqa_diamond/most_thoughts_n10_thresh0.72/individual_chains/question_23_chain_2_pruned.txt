Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to pick which of the options A to D are the possible products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's usually an addition reaction. But wait, the structure here is an ether. The molecule is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So the structure would have a benzene ring with an ether oxygen connected to a butenyl group. Let me draw that structure mentally.

The butenyl group is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-O-Ph? Wait, no. The but-3-en-1-yl group would be CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH. Wait, but the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure would be:

The butenyl group is 3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So positions 1 to 4.

Wait, but the structure is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? No, wait. The correct structure would be:

The group is but-3-en-1-yl, which has four carbons, with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond from C3 to C4, making it CH2-CH2-CH=CH. But wait, but the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So on the second carbon in the chain, there's two methyl groups attached.

Wait, so
