Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what this unknown compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the Mass Spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, molecular weight of 156. Let me think about possible compounds. The options given are A, B, C, D, which are all chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Looking at the IR data: there's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks usually indicate O-H stretches. Oh, but wait, it's broad. O-H could be from a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's around the carbonyl region. 1720 is a bit lower than a typical ketone (which is higher around 1700-1750?), but wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid or an ester. Or maybe an aldehyde? Wait, no, aldehyde carbonyls are higher, like around 1720? Or maybe it's an acid. 

Wait, benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700 cm⁻¹. Let me check. Carboxylic acids have a strong peak around 1700, maybe a bit higher. Ester carbonyls are a bit higher, maybe like 1740-1760? So 1720 could be a carboxylic acid or maybe something else. But wait, the IR also has a broad peak, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid because aldehydes have sharp peaks, but their O-H (if any, like in formic acid) would be different. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the IR might show a peak around 2800-2720 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but I'm not sure if that's in the given data.

Looking at the 1H NMR: 

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a singlet at around 11 ppm. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton, maybe. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes can be upfield or downfield depending on substituents. Wait, 11 is a bit high, but phenyl groups can deshield it. Alternatively, that could be a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But in the NMR, it's a singlet and the integration is 1H. So if it's a carboxylic acid, it's usually a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde. 

Wait, but the IR didn't mention a peak that would correspond to an aldehyde's C-H stretch. Aldehydes have a peak around 2820 and 2720 cm⁻¹, which are usually sharp. The IR here has a broad peak from 3500-2700. Oh, that could include the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. So the broad peak is probably O-H of a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1H NMR would then show a broad singlet around 10-12 ppm, but in this case, the peak at 11 is a singlet. So maybe it's more like a formate ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe a phenol, but the NMR doesn't show a broad peak, it's a singlet. Hmm.

Wait, the options: Let me look at the options. 

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxy
