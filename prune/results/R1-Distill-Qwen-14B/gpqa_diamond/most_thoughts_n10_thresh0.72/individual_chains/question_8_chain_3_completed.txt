Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about gene interactions related to disease resistance in plants. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They did knock-out mutants and double mutants to see how they affect resistance to anthracnose. The resistance levels are given for each single mutant and the double mutants.

The results are:
- g1: 75% resistance
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. Remember that in genetics, if a double mutant has a resistance that's lower than the single mutants, it might indicate an epistatic relationship. Epistasis is where the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Like, gene A is epistatic to gene B if the phenotype of aa is the same as aa bb, meaning gene A is downstream.

Also, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of another. So, a transcription factor would typically activate other genes. If a TF is knocked out, the downstream genes wouldn't be expressed, leading to lower resistance.

Looking at the data, the wild type is 100%. Let's see each mutant:

g1: 75% → so it's less resistant than wild type. Maybe G1 is involved in increasing resistance, but not critical. Because when G1 is knocked out, the resistance drops, but not completely.

g2: 0% → So the mutant is completely susceptible. That's a big drop. So G2 is probably critical for resistance. Since the single mutant is 0%, that suggests G2 might be a transcription factor that activates other defense genes. Without G2, the downstream genes aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

g3: 50% → So knocking out G3 reduces resistance by half. Maybe G3 is downstream of another gene, or perhaps it's part of a redundant pathway.

Now looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → Both genes knocked out leads to 0% resistance. Since g2 alone is 0%, the double mutant with g1 might be similar because when g2 is already knocked out, knocking out g1 doesn't change the outcome. So perhaps G1 is epistatic to G2, or maybe G2 is upstream of G1. Wait, but g2 is a transcription factor, perhaps, so it's upstream.

Wait, the situation where a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants suggests epistasis. For example, if g2 is upstream of g1, then when both are knocked out, it's like just having g2 knocked out because g1's function is already blocked by the lack of G2. So in this case, g1g2 shows 0% like g2, which suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1, or that G2 is upstream. Because when G2 is not present, the action of G1 doesn't matter anymore.

Wait, G2 is a transcription factor, which would be upstream. So, if G2 is a TF that activates G1, then in a g2 mutant, G1 wouldn't be expressed anyway. So knocking out G1 in addition wouldn't change anything. So the double mutant g1g2 would have the same phenotype as g2 because G1 is downstream of G2. So this suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, but epistasis is where the effect of one gene is dependent on another. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of gene A masks the effect of gene B. So, in this case, G2 being upstream (a TF) would mean that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because if G2 is knocked out, G1's function is irrelevant because G2's product (the TF) isn't there to activate G1. So in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is the same as g2, which is 0%.

Looking at another double mutant: g1g3. Their resistance is 10%, which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So the double mutant is worse than either single. That might suggest that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but not necessarily epistatic. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 work in parallel pathways. If both are knocked out, the resistance drops further.

Wait, when you have two genes in parallel pathways (redundant), the double mutant would have a more severe phenotype than either single. Because each provides some level of resistance. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, the single mutants each have some resistance, but the double mutant would have much less, maybe additive or multiplicative effects.

Looking at the numbers:

g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. Their double, g1g3, is 10% which is much lower. So if each contributes say 75 and 50, but they're redundant, knocking both out would cause 75+50 = 125% which is impossible, so perhaps multiplicative: 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375 → 37.5% but the result is 10%, which is even lower. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're in separate pathways, but the loss of both causes a much bigger effect.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is upstream of G3. Then, if G1 is knocked out, G3 wouldn't be expressed. But wait, g3's resistance is 50%, while g1g3 is 10%. So if G1 is upstream of G3, then in g1, G3 wouldn't be expressed, so g1 would have 0% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75% which is higher than g3's 50%. So that can't be right. Maybe G3 is upstream of G1? Or perhaps they're in a different pathway.

Wait, another double mutant: g2g3. Their resistance is 0%. Since both g2 and g3 are single mutants, which are 0% and 50% respectively. The double mutant is 0%, which is the same as g2. So, in this case, the presence of the g2 mutation masks the effect of g3. So this suggests that G2 is epistatic to G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the effect of knocking out G3 doesn't matter. So G2 is upstream of G3. So G2's product is necessary for G3's function.

Wait, but the data for g2g3 is 0% resistance, same as g2. So knocking out G3 in a g2 background doesn't change anything. So if G2 is upstream of G3, then without G2, G3 can't function. So in the g2 mutant, G3 is not expressed, hence the same phenotype as g2.

So, putting this together:

- G2 is a transcription factor, as its knockout leads to 0% resistance. So G2 is acting upstream of other genes, possibly G1 and G3.

Wait, but in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So perhaps G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, but they might be in separate pathways or perhaps G1 is also a transcription factor downstream of G2.

Wait, but the question says at least one gene is a transcription factor. So G2 is the likely candidate for that, given that its knockout is completely susceptible. So G2 is a transcription factor, and it acts upstream of other genes.

Now, considering the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. So G2 is upstream of G1. So the function of G1 is dependent on G2.

But wait, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. If G2 is upstream of G1, then in the absence of G2, G1 wouldn't be expressed. So the g2 mutant would have no G1 product, which would explain why g2 is 0%. But then, in the g1 mutant, G2 is still present, so G1 can function. So the g1 mutant is 75%, which suggests that G1 contributes 75% resistance, and G2 perhaps contributes the remaining 25% when G1 is present.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is in a parallel pathway to G2. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Another point: looking at the double mutants involving G3.

g1g3 is 10% → which is worse than either single. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway or redundant.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, their double mutant would have a lower resistance than either. But if they are in parallel pathways, the effect would be additive or multiplicative. Let me think: if two genes are in redundant pathways, each provides some resistance. When both are knocked out, there's no redundancy, so resistance drops more.

For example, if each provides 75% and 50% respectively, perhaps the wild type is 100% because either gene can provide resistance. Then, the double mutant would have 0% resistance. But in our case, the double mutant is 10%, which is not zero. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are additive but not fully redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is downstream of both G1 and G2. Let me think.

Wait, let's try to map out the possible interactions.

G2 is a transcription factor. So it activates other genes. Those could be G1 and/or G3.

Looking at the data, when G2 is knocked out (g2), both G1 and G3 are not functional (assuming G2 activates them). So in g2, resistance is 0%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%).

So, if G2 activates both G1 and G3, then in g2, both are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance.

In g1, G1 is non-functional, but G3 is still functional. So why is resistance 75%? Hmm, that doesn't add up. Because if G3 is functional, maybe it contributes some resistance.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. G2 activates both. So when G2 is knocked out, neither pathway works, hence 0% resistance.

In g1 (only G1 knocked out), G3 is still active, but perhaps it alone isn't enough to provide full resistance. So g1 has 75% resistance, suggesting that G1 contributes more than G3. G3, when alone, gives 50% resistance. So perhaps G1 is in a more critical pathway.

Wait, but then why does the double mutant g1g3 have 10% resistance? If G2 is present, which activates both G1 and G3, but in the double mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So without G1 and G3, the resistance would be even lower. But wait, in the case of g1g3, it's the same as if neither G1 nor G3 is active. But when G2 is active, but G1 and G3 are knocked out, maybe there's another pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the only way the plant can resist the pathogen is through G2 which activates either G1 or G3. So in the single mutants, some level of resistance remains because the other gene is active. But in the double mutant, both are inactive, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but the data shows that g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. Hmm, that complicates things.

Let me try to make a table.

Wild type: 100% (all genes functional)
g1: 75% → G1 is non-functional, but G2 and G3 are okay. So maybe G2 and G3 are functional, but their combined activity is 75% of wild type.
g2: 0% → G2 is non-functional, so others are non-functional as well. So G1 and G3 are non-functional because G2 is the TF for them.
g3: 50% → G3 is non-functional, so G2 and G1 are okay. But the resistance is 50%, less than g1's 75%.

Wait, that seems confusing. Because if G2 is a TF, then g2 would have G1 and G3 non-functional. But if in g1, only G1 is non-functional, then G2 and G3 are okay. So why is the resistance 75%?

Hmm, perhaps G1 and G3 work in parallel pathways. So the plant's resistance is additive based on both. So, G1 contributes 75% and G3 contributes 50%, but their combined contribution is additive.

Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either. So perhaps their contributions are redundant, but not fully additive.

Alternatively, perhaps the resistance is determined by the sum of the contributions. Let me think: maybe each gene contributes a certain amount. So G1 contributes 75%, G3 contributes 50%, and G2 is a TF that activates both, so without G2, neither is expressed.

But in the single mutants:

g1: G1 is knocked out, so only G3 is active, which is 50%. But the data shows 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about gene function.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then without G2, other genes (like G1 and G3) can't be expressed. So in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 aren't expressed, which matches the 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G1 is not expressed, but G2 and G3 are. So why is the resistance 75%? Maybe G2's function is to activate other defense mechanisms beyond G1 and G3. Or perhaps G2 is not required for G3 in this case.

Wait, but the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So G2 is the likely candidate.

Another possibility is that G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. So without G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. Without G1, G3 might not be expressed either, but perhaps G2 can activate G3 directly. Hmm.

Wait, but in the g1 mutant, G1 is knocked out. If G2 is upstream of G3, then G3 can be expressed. So in g1, G3 is functional, which would explain g1's 75% resistance. But in the data, g3 has 50% resistance. Hmm, so if G3 is functional in g1, why is it less than g1?

Wait, perhaps G1 is an activator of some other genes, and G3 is a different gene. So in g1, G3 is functional but G1's function is missing, leading to 75% resistance. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the double mutants again.

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. So the presence of a non-functional G2 masks the effect of G1's mutation.

g1g3: 10% → lower than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. If both are knocked out, the pathway is completely inactive, leading to very low resistance.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3, so knocking out G3 when G2 is already knocked out doesn't change anything.

So, from this, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. That suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Now, if G2 is a transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in g2, resistance is 0% (matches data).

In the g1 mutant, G1 isn't expressed, but G2 and G3 are. So perhaps G3 is expressed, but its function isn't enough to provide full resistance. So the resistance is 75% in g1, which is higher than g3's 50%. That suggests that without G1, but with G3, resistance is higher than without G3 but with G1?

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think: If G2 is the TF for both G1 and G3,

In g1: G1 is knocked out, so G2 can still activate G3. So G3 is expressed.

In g3: G3 is knocked out, so G2 can activate G1. So G1 is expressed.

If both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, their individual knockout's resistance would depend on which is more important.

In the data, g1 (only G1 knocked out) has 75%, and g3 has 50%. So G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So when G1 is present, the resistance is higher than when G3 is present.

But when both are knocked out (g1g3), resistance is 10%—much lower than either single mutant. That suggests that both genes contribute to resistance, and their functions are additive or synergistic.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF for both, and in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present, so why is the resistance 10%? Because G2 is present but can't activate G1 or G3. So in g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so G2 can't activate them. Thus, all three genes (G1, G2, G3) are non-functional in g1g3? Or no—wait, in g1g3, only G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 is functional.

Wait, no: the mutants are g1 (G1 knockout), g2 (G2 knockout), etc. So in g1g3, G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional. So G2 can activate any downstream genes, but perhaps G1 and G3 are the only ones downstream.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then in g1g3, G2 is still active, but since G1 and G3 are knocked out, the downstream genes (maybe others) aren't active. But in this case, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than any single mutant. So maybe the only way to get resistance is through the G1 and G3 genes. So without G1 and G3, even if G2 is active, there's no resistance.

So, the resistance is provided by the downstream genes that G2 activates, which are G1 and G3. So if both are knocked out, then no resistance, but the data says 10%. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe G2 also has a function independent of G1 and G3.

Wait, the data shows that in g1g3, resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined knockout further reduces resistance beyond either single mutant. So, perhaps they're in a redundant pathway.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then in the single mutants, each can provide some resistance. But in the double mutant, neither is present, so resistance is much lower.

But in that case, how does the presence of G2 affect this? Because G2 is a TF upstream.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of different pathways, but both require G2 to function.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, the data suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1 (because g1g2 is 0% same as g2). So G2 is epistatic to G1, which fits this option. But the option says G1 is a TF. But from the data, G2 is more likely the TF because g2 is 0%, which suggests it's critical.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

If G1 and G3 have same promoter, they would be co-regulated by G2. So knocking out G2 would knock out both. But in the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. So in g1, G3 is functional, leading to 75% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So if G1 and G3 are co-regulated, why are their single mutants different?

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Wait, G1 is epistatic to G3. So in a double mutant, the phenotype would be same as g1. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is not same as g1 (75%) nor g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy means that the two genes provide the same function. So knocking out both would have a more severe effect. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in a double mutant, the phenotype is same as G1.

But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single. So this suggests that their functions are additive, not epistatic. So perhaps they are redundant, but the double mutant is worse than either single, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so their double knockout would be worse than either single.

Wait, going back to the question. The options are about what conclusion we can draw.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But our analysis suggests that G2 is a TF, not G1. So option A is unlikely.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, what's pleiotropy? Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. But I'm not sure how that applies here. Maybe it's a distractor.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 have multiple functions, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the data again, the double mutants involving G2 have resistance same as g2: 0% for g1g2 and g2g3. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the single mutants:

g1: 75% → so without G1, resistance is 75%, meaning G1 contributes 25% of the resistance.

g2: 0% → G2 is a TF, so without it, resistance is 0%.

g3: 50% → Without G3, resistance is 50%, so G3 contributes 50% of the resistance.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3, then without G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So their levels would be 0%, but the data shows that in g1 (G1 knockout), G2 and G3 are present. So in g1, G3 is expressed, which provides 50% of the resistance. But the data shows that g1 is 75% resistance. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates other TFs, which in turn activate defense genes. So maybe G2 → G1 and G3, which then activate other genes that provide resistance.

In that case, the absence of G2 would mean no G1 and G3, hence no resistance (g2: 0%).

In g1, G1 is absent, but G2 and G3 are present. So G3 can still activate its downstream genes, leading to 50% resistance. But the data shows g1 is 75%. Which is higher than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit unless G1 is involved in a more potent defense pathway.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both activated by G2, but when G1 is knocked out, G3 is still active, leading to 50% resistance. But the data shows g1 is 75%, which is higher. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G1, and G1 activates G3. So without G2, G1 isn't expressed, so G3 isn't either. But if G2 is present, G1 is expressed, which then activates G3.

In that case, in g1 mutant, G3 isn't expressed because G1 is needed to activate it. So in g1, resistance would be the same as g2, which is 0%, but the data shows g1 is 75%. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it from the options.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is likely option A, C, or D.

Wait, the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1.

But earlier analysis suggests G2 is the TF. So this is probably not correct.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here. But perhaps G1 and G3 are involved in other functions beyond resistance, but that's not relevant to the question.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in a double mutant, the phenotype is same as G1. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is not same as either. So that's confusing.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy would imply that knocking out both would have a worse phenotype than either single. So in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either (75% and 50%). So that fits.

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then each contributes to resistance, but in the absence of both, resistance is much lower.

Additionally, the double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) are 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, which fits.

So in this case, G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. So G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, providing redundant functions. When either is knocked out, the other can compensate, but when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower.

Looking at the data: g1 (only G1 knocked out) is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. That's confusing because if they are redundant, you would expect their single mutants to have similar resistance levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the redundancy isn't perfect. Maybe G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. So in the absence of G1, the remaining G3 provides 50% resistance, but in the absence of G3, the remaining G1 provides 75% resistance. That would explain the single mutant data.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant but not fully, meaning each contributes a certain amount, and together they make up the full resistance.

But in the double mutant, without both, resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single, thus fitting the idea of redundancy.

So, in this scenario, G2 is a TF activating G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, each contributing to resistance. When either is knocked out, the other can compensate, but only partially. When both are knocked out, the redundancy is gone, leading to very low resistance.

Additionally, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because the presence of a non-functional G2 masks the effect of G1 and G3 knockouts.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but redundancy is about function, not epistasis. So in a redundant scenario, each gene can compensate for the other, so the double mutant's phenotype would be the same as the more severe single mutant. But in our case, the double mutant is worse than both. So perhaps this isn't about redundancy but additive effects.

Wait, another possibility: G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their functions are additive. So each contributes a certain percentage, and together they provide more. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is the sum of their individual contributions subtracted from 100%.

But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So if they are additive, the double mutant would be 75% + 50% - 100% = 25%. But the data says it's 10%, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps their functions are multiplicative. 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375 → 37.5%, but the data is 10%. So that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me try to map out the possible interactions.

Another approach is to look for which option fits the data.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in a double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as G1. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is not the same as G1's 75%. So this doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype is same as G1. But again, it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3, but in this case, the double mutant's resistance is lower than G1's. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe G1 is upstream of G3. So G1 activates G3. Therefore, in g1, G3 isn't expressed. So the resistance in g1 would be due to G3 not being present. But the data shows g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is upstream of G1. So in g3, G1 isn't expressed. But the data shows g3 is 50%, which is lower than g1's 75%, which fits.

But then, what about the double mutant g1g3? If G3 is upstream of G1, then in g3, G1 isn't expressed. So in g1g3, you have both G1 and G3 knocked out. But why is the resistance 10%?

If G3 is upstream of G1, then in g3, G1 isn't expressed, so the resistance is 50%, perhaps because G1 isn't there. But why is g1's resistance 75%? Because in g1, G3 is present and active, so it activates G1, but wait, no, G1 is knocked out. So if G3 is upstream and activates G1, then in g1, G3 can't activate G1 because G1 is knocked out. So maybe G3 has another function.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about what each option implies.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So they have the same function. Each contributes the same amount. So in a single mutant, each would have 50% resistance (if each contributes 50% to 100%). But the data shows g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So this doesn't fit redundancy. Hence, option D is probably incorrect.

Wait, but maybe G1 contributes more than G3. So G1 is 75% and G3 is 50%. So when both are knocked out, their combined effect is 75% +50% - 100% = 25%. But the data says 10%, which doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Let me try another approach. Let's think about what each double mutant tells us.

In double mutant g1g2 (resistance 0%):

Since g2 is 0%, the presence of the g1 mutation doesn't change the phenotype. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, in g2g3 (0%), same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

In the double mutant g1g3 (10%):

This is worse than either single mutant (75% and 50%). So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined knockout leads to a much lower resistance.

So, if G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, which are in the same pathway, then their combined knockout leads to more severe resistance.

So, the pathway might look like: G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance.

In that case, in g1, G3 is expressed (since G2 is active), so resistance is due to G3. But why is g1's resistance higher than g3? Because g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. So maybe G1 is more efficient than G3 in activating the resistance pathway.

Wait, but if G2 activates both G1 and G3, then in the absence of G1 (g1), G3 is expressed, leading to resistance via G3. But why would g1 have higher resistance than g3? That would imply that G3 is more active when G1 is present. Which seems a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is a TF that activates G3. So G2 → G1 → G3 → resistance.

In that case:

- In g1, G1 is knocked out, so G3 isn't activated. So resistance would be same as g2 (0%), but data shows g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Maybe it's better to just pick the option that fits the epistatic relationships.

G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as seen in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both being 0% (same as g2).

Now, looking at the interaction between G1 and G3:

g1g3 is 10%, lower than either. So their effects are additive. That suggests that they function in parallel pathways.

But if G2 is a TF for both, then their functions are dependent on G2.

So, in the wild type, G2 activates both G1 and G3. Each contributes to resistance. If G1 is knocked out (g1), G3 is still active (50% resistance). If G3 is knocked out (g3), G1 is active (75% resistance). If both are knocked out (g1g3), neither is active, leading to 10% resistance.

So in this scenario, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So their double knockout leads to additive effects beyond either single.

Which would suggest that G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but are in separate pathways.

So, in terms of the options, which one matches this?

Looking back at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1.

No, because G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter suggests same regulation. But in the data, their single mutants are different.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3.

Not sure about pleiotropy.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

But if they're redundant, the single mutants should have similar resistance. Here, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is none of these, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor. The data suggests that G2 is the TF because its knockout leads to 0% resistance, and it's epistatic to G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the double mutants, g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and they're both downstream of G2. So, in the absence of both G1 and G3, there's no resistance, but even with one, there's some.

But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which suggests that G1 is more important than G3 in that pathway.

So, perhaps the pathway is G2 → G1 → defense genes, and G2 → G3 → other defense genes.

So, in g1, without G1, only G3's pathway is active (50% resistance), but in the data, g1 is 75%, which doesn't fit. So perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Maybe I should look for which option correctly describes the epistatic relationships.

In the data:

g2 is epistatic to g1 and g3.

In the double mutants, when G2 is present (in g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single. So this suggests that G1 and G3 are in a pathway that's separate from G2.

Wait, but G2 is a TF, so it's upstream of other genes.

I'm going to make an educated guess. The correct answer is option A: G1 is a TF, but earlier analysis suggests G2 is the TF. So maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But I'm not confident. Another approach is to think about what each option implies about the double mutants.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. So when both are knocked out, it's same as G2. Which matches the data (g1g2 is 0%).

Option D: G1 is epistatic to G3. So in g1g3, the phenotype would be the same as G1 (75%), but the data shows 10%, which doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the problem states that at least one gene is a TF upstream of others. So the transcription factor is likely the one whose knockout leads to a severe phenotype. So in this case, g2's resistance is 0%, which suggests that G2 is a TF.

So, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

If G2 is a TF activating G1 and G3, then in the absence of G2 (g2), both G1 and G3 are not expressed, so resistance is 0%.

In g1, G1 is not expressed, but G2 and G3 are. So G3 is expressed, but why is resistance 75%? Maybe G3's function isn't as crucial as G1's.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. So in g1, G3 isn't expressed, leading to lower resistance. But the data shows g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. That doesn't fit.

I think I need to make a choice based on the options and the data.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Does this fit?

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as G1. But in the data, it's 10%, which is not same as G1's 75% or G3's 50%. So this doesn't fit.

Option D) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy implies that each gene can compensate for the other. So, in the absence of one, the other can take over. So in the double mutant, the resistance should be the same as either single mutant. But the data shows worse resistance (10%) than either. So this contradicts redundancy.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, and G2 is upstream. So G2 → G1 → G3 → resistance.

In this case:

- g2: 0% (can't activate G1 or G3)
- g1: G1 non-functional, so G3 isn't activated. So resistance would be same as g2, but the data shows 75%. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes. So in the absence of G1 (g1), G3 is still active, leading to some resistance (50%). But the data shows g1 is 75%, which is higher than g3's 50%. So that suggests that G1 contributes more than G3.

But in the double mutant, without both G1 and G3, the resistance is 10%. So perhaps the combined effect is additive beyond either single. I'm not sure how that fits in.

At this point, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

In a double mutant, the phenotype would match the more epistatic gene. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype would be same as G1. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is not same as G1. So option D is probably incorrect.

I think I'm going to have to go with option A, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps option C.

Wait, another approach: the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since both G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, their combined knockout would lead to the most severe phenotype. But how does this relate to epistasis?

Alternatively, perhaps the double mutant's low resistance suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their double knockout has a more severe effect.

But I'm stuck. I'll go with the conclusion that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their interaction is such that each contributes to resistance, but when both are knocked out, their combined effect is much worse.

Looking at the options, the one that fits this is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D.

Wait, the correct answer is likely option A, but based on the initial analysis, I think option A is not correct because it says G1 is a TF, but G2 is the TF.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, but without more info, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, perhaps the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, but their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. So the answer is option D.

But in that case, their single mutants would have similar resistance, which they don't. So perhaps that's not right.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess. Based on the data, the correct answer is option A is incorrect because G1 is not the TF. Option C says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: the fact that g1g3 is 10% suggests that both G1 and G3 are required for full resistance. So, their functions are additive, and without both, the resistance drops much lower.

So, perhaps G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their effects are additive. So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower.

In this scenario, G1 and G3 are not redundant but additive.

But the options don't include an additive scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their functions are partially independent. So their combined knockout leads to a much worse phenotype.

But without knowing the exact gene functions, it's hard to say.

I think the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined knockout leads to more severe resistance. But I'm not sure which option matches this.

Looking at the options again, the only one that says G2 is a TF is options A, C, and D.

Option C says G1 is epistatic to G3, but data doesn't fit.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which doesn't fit the data.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of what each option says about epistasis.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1.

Yes, because in g1g2, the resistance is same as g2.

Option C: G1 is epistatic to G3.

No, because in g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either.

So, the correct answer must have G2 as the TF and G2 being epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Which options have G2 as TF and G2 epistatic? Let's see.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So yes.

But option A says G1 is a TF, which conflicts with G2 being the TF.

Option C: G2 is a TF, and G2 is epistatic to G3 (since in g2g3, resistance is same as g2).

But option C says G2 is a TF, but doesn't mention G2 being epistatic to G3.

Wait, the options are:

Option C) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So, this doesn't address G2 being epistatic to G3.

Only option A and D have G2 as TF and G2 epistatic.

Wait, no. Option D says G2 is a TF, but doesn't mention G2 being epistatic to G3.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck, but based on the double mutants, the correct answer is that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, which points to the correct option being either A or C.

But since option A says G1 is a TF, which is not supported by data, I think the correct answer is option C.

Wait, I think I'm getting myself more confused. Another approach: what conclusion can be drawn from the data?

We can conclude that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because in the double mutants involving G2, the resistance is same as G2.

We can also conclude that G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other because the double mutant g1g3 has a worse phenotype than either.

Thus, G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their effects are additive.

Looking at the options, the one that fits is option A, but it says G1 is a TF.

Another option: none of the options perfectly fit, but perhaps option C is the best fit.

Wait, the only option where G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic to others is option C? No, option C says G2 is a TF but doesn't state G2 is epistatic.

Hmm. I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.


The question involves analyzing the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine to determine their roles in resistance to anthracnose. The data provided includes resistance levels for single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The goal is to draw conclusions about the genetic interactions, particularly focusing on transcription factors, pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistasis.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **Resistance Levels**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (G1 knockout).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (G2 knockout).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (G3 knockout).
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (both G1 and G2 knocked out).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (both G1 and G3 knocked out).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (both G2 and G3 knocked out).

2. **G2 as a Transcription Factor**:
   - The g2 mutant has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance. This strongly suggests that G2 is a transcription factor (TF) upstream of other genes, as its absence completely abolishes resistance.

3. **Epistasis**:
   - In double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3), the resistance is 0%, matching the resistance of g2. This indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The function of G1 and G3 is dependent on G2, meaning that without G2, the effects of knocking out G1 or G3 are masked.

4. **Interactions Between G1 and G3**:
   - The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is lower than either single mutant (g1: 75%, g3: 50%). This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a non-epistatic manner, likely through additive or synergistic effects. However, their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% vs. 50%), indicating they are not fully redundant or pleiotropic.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. This is inconsistent with the data, as G2, not G1, is the transcription factor, and pleiotropy is not supported by the observations.
   - **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 share the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1. This is unlikely because the single mutants (g1 and g3) have different resistance levels, contradicting the idea of shared promoters or G3 being epistatic to G1.
   - **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, pleiotropy is not supported, and the data does not indicate that G1 is epistatic to G3 (as g1g3 resistance is lower than either single mutant).
   - **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Redundancy is not fully supported, as the single mutants have different resistance levels. Additionally, the double mutant g1g3 resistance (10%) is lower than either single mutant, contradicting the idea of redundancy.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is a transcription factor and that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. However, none of the options perfectly fit the observations. Based on the analysis, **Option C** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and partially aligns with the non-epistatic interaction between G1 and G3, even though pleiotropy and epistasis claims are not fully supported.
