Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They are moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just use the classical velocity addition formula. Instead, I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I get that right. So the first astronaut's velocity is 0.6c, and the second is 0.5c. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the first from the second's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, that's one of the options. So I think the relative speed is around 0.14c.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the relative speed, but which direction? Oh, right, since the first is moving faster than the second, the relative speed of the first from the second's perspective is positive, so 0.14c.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's total energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c². So I need to compute the total energy of both astronauts and sum them.

First, the astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Gamma for this one is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c. So v squared is 0.36 c². 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So the energy for this astronaut is gamma * m c². Wait, but the mass is 2m, so 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Next, the astronaut with mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Let's calculate gamma. v is 0.5c, so v²/c² is 0.25. 1 -
