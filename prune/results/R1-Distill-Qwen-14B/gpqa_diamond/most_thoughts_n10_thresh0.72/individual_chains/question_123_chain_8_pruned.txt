Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the distance an ejecta travels. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that a supernova happened in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames, which means no acceleration involved, so maybe I can use some special relativity here. Wait, but the problem statement says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so that's good, no complicating factors there.

From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. Time measurements can differ between frames. Oh right, time dilation comes into play here because of the high speed. So the time experienced in the galaxy's frame isn't the same as the ejecta's frame.

I remember that in special relativity, the time experienced in one frame is longer than the other if they're moving relative to each other. The formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and t is the time in the stationary frame (the galaxy's frame), while t' is the proper time in the moving frame (ejecta's frame).

Wait, but wait. Which frame is which? The ejecta's frame sees the galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, right? Because in relativity, the relative speed is symmetrical in that way.

Wait, no, wait. According to the problem, the ejecta and galaxy are both inertial frames. So the speed between them is 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at that same speed. So that's correct.

So the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (t'). I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the
