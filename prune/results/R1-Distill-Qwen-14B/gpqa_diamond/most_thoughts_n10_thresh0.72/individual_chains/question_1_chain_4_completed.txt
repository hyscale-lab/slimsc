Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. So about 6.6e-7 eV.

Second state has Δt2 = 1e-8 seconds:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.055e-26 J. 

Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-8 eV. So about 6.6e-8 eV.

The total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the two individual uncertainties, right? Because each state's uncertainty contributes to the overall uncertainty when measuring the difference. So total uncertainty ΔE_total ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So ΔE_total ≈ 6.6e-7 eV + 6.6e-8 eV = 7.26e-7 eV. 

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1, and the uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of the uncertainties in E1 and E2. Oh, because ΔE is the difference, so Δ(ΔE) = ΔE2 - ΔE1? Or wait, maybe the uncertainties add in quadrature. Or perhaps it's the sum when the two are independent. Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the uncertainty in the energy difference being the sum of the two individual uncertainties. Because each state's lifetime contributes to the uncertainty in their respective energies, and the difference's uncertainty would be the combination. So ΔE_diff = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, it must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. So E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

In our case, let's compute the sum. ΔE1 is about 6.6e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.6e-8 eV. So sum is 7.26e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 7.26e-7, so no good.
Option B)1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.
Option C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 eV vs 7.26e-7 eV. Oh wait, 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 7.26e-7. So that's way bigger than the uncertainty. So that would be resolvable.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 eV, which is less than 7.26e-7, so not enough.

So the only option that's larger than 7.26e-7 eV is option C, 1e-4 eV. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait another thing. The energy difference has to be larger than the combined uncertainty. So, if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7.26e-7 eV, so that would be clearly resolvable.

So the correct option would be option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Total uncertainty in the energy difference
The total uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare the energy difference to the total uncertainty
For the energy difference to be clearly resolved, it must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is not resolvable.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is not resolvable.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is approximately \( 1 \, \text{mV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This energy difference is clearly resolvable.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is not resolvable.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that is greater than the total uncertainty and can be clearly resolved is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

**Answer: C**
