Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of two reactions. Let's start by taking it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I'm thinking this might be a Claisen or some kind of aldol addition reaction. Wait, wait. The molecule is a ketone, specifically 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1 on the cyclohexane ring. The substituents are ethyl and methyl groups at positions 2 and 6, respectively.

Ethyl acrylate is an ester with a double bond. Acrylate has the structure CHâ‚‚=CHCOOEt. So when a ketone reacts with an acrylate under basic conditions, it's probably a Michael addition or a conjugate addition. Alternatively, since it's a cyclic ketone, maybe a Claisen-like reaction or some kind of cycloaddition.

Wait, another thought: when a ketone has adjacent substituents, the base could deprotonate alpha to the carbonyl. In this case, the carbonyl is at C1, so the alpha carbons are C2 and maybe C6. The substituents are already bulky at C2 (ethyl) and C6 (methyl). So maybe the base will deprotonate the less substituted position? Or perhaps the more accessible one.

But wait, the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1. The positions adjacent (alpha) would be positions 2 and position 6? Because in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to the next. Wait, numbering the cyclohexane ring: position 1 is the carbonyl, 2 is next to it, 6 is the other adjacent. So the carbonyl is at C1, and the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. But wait, looking at the structure, I think more carefully: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohex
