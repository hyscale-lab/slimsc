Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the main thing here is the Doppler shifts they caused: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's Doppler shift relates to the planet's mass and orbital period. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation. Let me think. The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the planet's orbital period, and the distance between them. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since the planets are similar to Neptune, which is much less massive than the star (M_p << M_*), we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies, right? K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but in this case, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_*, so M_* is the same for both. And both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both. Therefore, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K = (constant) * (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Since M_p and M_* are the same, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 / K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, no. Let me get that right.

Wait, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7. But K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so (K1)/(K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Let me write that down.

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait, wait, no. Let me be careful. Let's think of it as K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3
