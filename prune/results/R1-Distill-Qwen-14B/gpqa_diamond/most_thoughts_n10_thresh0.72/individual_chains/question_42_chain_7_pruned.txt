Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question involves three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure how that's relevant here, so maybe I can ignore that part for now.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by a factor of 1.4, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 2.3. So the temperatures are Planet1 > Planet2 > Planet3.

Then it gives the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So, Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, which in turn is more massive than Planet3.

The question asks for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. So, we're looking for (Period3 / Period1) = ?

All planets have the same albedo, which is 0.3, like Earth. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature, but since all are the same, maybe that cancels out in the calculations.

Hmm. I think equilibrium temperature relates to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L (1 - a))/(16 π D² σ)]^(1/4), where L is stellar luminosity, a is albedo, D is distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, but I don't know the luminosity here, but since all the planets are orbiting the same star, L is the same for all. So the ratio of their temperatures would depend on the distance. 

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula can be rewritten in terms of distance. Let me think. The formula is T ∝ sqrt(D) ? No, wait, no. Because T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4). So T ∝ D^(-1/2). Because L is a constant. So T ∝ (1/D)^(1/2) → T ∝ D^(-1/2). So if T1 / T2 = 1.4, then D2 / D1 = (T1 / T2)^(-2) = (1.4)^(-2).

Wait, let's make it precise. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π D² σ) ]^(1/4)

But since L, a, and σ are the same for all three planets, T is proportional to (1/D)^(1/4). So T ∝ D^(-1/4). Alternatively, D ∝ T^(-4).

Wait, wait, if T is proportional to D^(-1/2), no. Let me rederive it.

The equilibrium temperature equation is:

T = [ (L (1
