Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of flux between two energy bands. Let me think this through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, with the proton-proton (pp) chain being the main one. The pp-III branch is part of this chain, right? So if the pp-III suddenly stops, what happens to the neutrino flux?

Wait, neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun. The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, like the ones in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. Oh wait, no, actually, the neutrinos from the pp chain are lower energy, aren't they? Or wait, I think the dominant neutrinos come from the CNO cycle as well, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, I think most solar neutrinos are from the pp chain, specifically the pp-I branch. But the pp-III branch is a minor contributor. So if pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that process would stop, but the main pp and other processes continue.

But wait, the question says that only the pp-III branch stops. So other reactions, like pp-I and CNO, are still ongoing. So neutrinos from those would still be produced.

But the neutrinos from pp-III must be a significant portion of the high-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop, but lower

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the Sun produces neutrinos through various processes, and the pp chain is a big one. The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III branch stops, that change would only be felt here on Earth after that delay.

So, the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton cycle in the Sun's core. I think the main pp chain produces a lot of neutrinos, specifically electron neutrinos. The neutrinos are produced in the process where protons fuse to form deuterons, and then eventually helium-4. The main neutrinos come from the Beryllium-7 capture, which is part of the pp-I branch, but wait, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping.

Wait, maybe I should clarify what the pp-III branch does. Oh right, the pp chain has different branches, like pp-I and pp-II. Oh wait, actually, I think the main branch is pp-I, which produces boron-8, and then pp-II and pp-III are sub-branches. Or maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, maybe the pp chain is the dominant process and has a few sub-processes.

If pp-III stops, but the other reactions continue, what does that mean for neutrino production
