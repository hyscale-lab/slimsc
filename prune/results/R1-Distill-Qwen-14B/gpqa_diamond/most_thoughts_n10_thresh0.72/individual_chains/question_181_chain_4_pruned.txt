Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of flux between two energy bands. Let me think this through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, with the proton-proton (pp) chain being the main one. The pp-III branch is part of this chain, right? So if the pp-III suddenly stops, what happens to the neutrino flux?

Wait, neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun. The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, like the ones in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. Oh wait, no, actually, the neutrinos from the pp chain are lower energy, aren't they? Or wait, I think the dominant neutrinos come from the CNO cycle as well, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, I think most solar neutrinos are from the pp chain, specifically the pp-I branch. But the pp-III branch is a minor contributor. So if pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that process would stop, but the main pp and other processes continue.

But wait, the question says that only the pp-III branch stops. So other reactions, like pp-I and CNO, are still ongoing. So neutrinos from those would still be produced.

But the neutrinos from pp-III must be a significant portion of the high-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop, but lower
