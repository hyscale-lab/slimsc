Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined, and their energy levels are quantized. The problem is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, so they're fermions, right? Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state in the system. So for a one-dimensional infinite potential well, each particle will have a quantum number n, and because of the exclusion principle, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²) * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²) = n² E, where E is the given constant. Oh right, the question defines E as π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy depends on n squared.

Since we have four particles, we need to distribute them into the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion. Each state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin state. But wait, spin is 1/2, so for each n, there are two possible spin states: up and down. So each n can accommodate two particles, each with opposite spins.

So let's think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. For four fermions, we'll need to fill the lowest available n levels with two particles each.

The lowest n is 1. So two particles will have n=1, each in a different spin state. Next, n=2 can hold two more particles. So in the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two). The total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option C says ground state is 4E. Huh, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Wait, four particles, each in their own state? Or is the question considering the total energy of the system, adding the individual energies?

Wait, no, the energies of the ground state would be the sum of the energies of each particle

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know. Each particle is a spin-1/2 fermion, which means they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. They can't all occupy the same quantum state. Each quantum state is described by a set of quantum numbers, but in a 1D well, the main quantum number is n.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is E multiplied by n squared. So E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), as given in the problem. So each particle's energy would be E multiplied by their n squared.

But wait, since we have four identical fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each can't have the same set of quantum numbers. But in a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by n and their spin. Since spin is 1/2, each state can have two particles: one spin-up and one spin-down.

So for each energy level n, we can have two particles. Let's think about how the particles fill up the energy levels.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energy. So we fill the lowest energy levels with as many particles as we can. Each level can hold two particles.

Let me list the possible n values and their energies:

n=1: E = 1² E = E
n=2: 4E
n=3: 9E
n=4: 16E
n=5: 25E
n=6: 36E
...and so on.

Wait, wait, no. Because the given E is already (pi²...), so each n squared times E. So n=1 is E, n=2 is 4E, etc.

So with four particles, let's see how they fill up.

Each level can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down).

So the first level (n=1) can have 2, then n=2 another 2. So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles
n=2: 2 particles

So the ground state is when all four are filled into the first two energy levels. So the total energy of the system is the sum of each particle's energy.

But wait, each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E. So two in n=1: 2*E, two in n=2: 2*(4E) =8E. So total energy is 10E for the ground state.

Wait, but that's the total energy of the system. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but in the options, some options have the ground state as 4E or 10E. Let me check the options again.

Option C says 4E,10E,15E. Option B is 4E,10E,50E. So if the ground state is 10E, the options B and C have that as first or second. Wait, no, let me see the question again.

Wait, the question says, what are the energies of the ground state, first excited, second excited state of the system in terms of E. So the possible total energies for each state.

Wait, wait, no, no. No, the system's energy is the sum of individual energies. So each particle's energy adds up.

But wait, when particles are in the same energy level, their individual energies are the same. So for the ground state, two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the system's ground state energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

Then, the first excited state... Hmm, what's the next possible arrangement.

In the ground state, the lowest two levels are filled. To get the first excited state, we have to promote one particle to the next available level. But since we have four particles, and each level can hold two, perhaps the first excited state would have one particle promoted to the next level.

Wait, but let me think again. The ground state is n=1 and n=2 each with two particles. The next possible state would involve moving one particle to a higher energy level.

Wait, but in fermionic systems, each level can hold two particles. So after n=2 is filled, the next level is n=3. So to get the first excited state, perhaps we have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in the ground state, all four are in the lowest possible. So in the ground state, n=1 and n=2 are each filled with two particles. To get the first excited state, you can't just promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, because that's higher energy. But perhaps the lowest possible next state is when one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3.

So the configuration would be: n=1 (two particles), n=2 (one particle), n=3 (one particle).

Then the total energy would be 2*E + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that would be for the first excited state? Or is that the second excited state?

Wait, no, because with four particles, perhaps the order is more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of possible states, ordered by their energies.

The ground state is the lowest possible, which is
