Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined, and their energy levels are quantized. The problem is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, so they're fermions, right? Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state in the system. So for a one-dimensional infinite potential well, each particle will have a quantum number n, and because of the exclusion principle, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²) * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²) = n² E, where E is the given constant. Oh right, the question defines E as π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy depends on n squared.

Since we have four particles, we need to distribute them into the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion. Each state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin state. But wait, spin is 1/2, so for each n, there are two possible spin states: up and down. So each n can accommodate two particles, each with opposite spins.

So let's think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. For four fermions, we'll need to fill the lowest available n levels with two particles each.

The lowest n is 1. So two particles will have n=1, each in a different spin state. Next, n=2 can hold two more particles. So in the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two). The total energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option C says ground state is 4E. Huh, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Wait, four particles, each in their own state? Or is the question considering the total energy of the system, adding the individual energies?

Wait, no, the energies of the ground state would be the sum of the energies of each particle
