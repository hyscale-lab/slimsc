Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which is a framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators.

The question gives four options about symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. I need to determine which of these must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Hmm, first, I need to recall what each symmetry means and whether SMEFT enforces them.

Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the SM, so I think all operators in SMEFT must maintain Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, the theory would conflict with the SM's predictions.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Oh right, because the Poincare group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations in spacetime. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which already incorporates the SM symmetries. The SM respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT should too. But wait, I thought that when you write operators in SMEFT, they are written in a way that respects the symmetries of the SM. So I'm thinking that both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected. But wait, if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz symmetry, then it can't
