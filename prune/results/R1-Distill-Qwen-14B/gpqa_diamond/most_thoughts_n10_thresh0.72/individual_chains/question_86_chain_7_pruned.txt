Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll take it step by step.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on unknown compounds A and B. The products are both (R) and (S) forms of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, I need to figure out what A and B are based on the reagents used.

Let me recall what I know about reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically for carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes, turning them into alcohols. BH3 is another reducing agent, but I think it's usually used in a different context, maybe in the formation of alkenes from epoxides or in hydroboration reactions. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! BH3 is a part of the reducing agents used in the reduction of esters. Wait, or is it for ketals or acetals?

Wait, another thought. Oh! When you have a ketone or ester, certain reducing agents can affect it. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think clearly.

So, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure sounds like a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, right? So, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would have a ketone at position 2 and a saturated ring (so it's a cyclic ether, like a tetrahydropyran). Wait, no, a tetrahydropyran would have four single bonds, but the 2H suggests that there's a double bond elsewhere. Hmm, maybe the ring is partially hydrogenated.

But I'm more focused on the formation of this product. The starting materials are A and B, treated with either LiBH4 and H+ or BH3 and H+.

Wait, the product is a ketone. So, maybe the starting material is an ester or some kind
