Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about the decay of a hydrogen atom state through dipole transitions. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and it decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the transition route and the corresponding probability from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in hydrogen atom transitions, electrons can transition between energy levels with changes in their angular momentum quantum numbers. Dipole transitions are governed by the selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1. But wait, the initial and final states here have l=0. So going from l=0, what possible l's can we transition to?

Right, because the initial is 3,0,0, so l=0. The first transition must change l to l’ = 1, since Δl = ±1. Then the next transition must go from l=1 to l=0 again. So the path must be 3,0,0 → something with l=1 → 1,0,0.

Let me think about the possible steps. The first transition is from n=3, l=0 to a state with l=1. So possible values for n would be 2 or 4, but since the next state goes to n=1, the first transition must go to n=2, because 3 → 2 is possible, and 2 →1 is allowed. So first step is 3,0,0 → 2,1, m? The m can change by 0, ±1. So for the first transition, m starts at 0. So m can go to -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but the initial state has m=0. So the transition can change m by 0, ±1. So the possible m' after the first transition would be -1, 0, +1. So the possible states after first transition are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩.

Then, from the second transition, we go from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. So here, l changes from 1 to 0, which is Δl=-1, which is allowed. Now, for the m, from the state with l=1, m can change by ±1 or 0. But the final state has m=0. So the state after the second transition must have m=0.

Let me think about each possible first step:

If the first step goes to |2,1,0⟩, then in the second step, m must go from 0 to 0 (since the final state has m=0). So the second transition would require that the m doesn't change. Wait, but the selection rule allows Δm=0, ±1. So from m=0, can it go to m=0? Yes. So the second transition would be from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Alternatively, if the first step is |2,1,1⟩, then to reach m=0 in the second step, the m must decrease by 1. So that's allowed because Δm can be -1. Similarly, if first step is to |2,1,-1⟩, the second transition would need to increase m by 1 to reach 0, which is allowed.

So the possible paths are:

1. 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 →1,0,0
2. 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0 (but wait, can you go from 2,1,1 to 1,0,0? Because l must go from 1 to 0, and m goes from 1 to 0. So the Δl is -1, which is allowed, and Δm is -1, which is allowed. So yes.

Similarly, 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0. Because from m=-1 to m=0: Δm=+1, which is allowed.

So all three possible first transitions are allowed. Now, the probability of each path would depend on the square of the transition dipole moment, or the matrix elements. But I'm not supposed to calculate the exact probabilities from first principles, but perhaps the problem gives options, so maybe the possible cases are limited.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option D: It seems like the first part is missing, but looking again, it says |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3.

Wait, the options might have typos, but assuming the transitions are as written.

So for each possible first step, what is the probability?

But wait, the problem states that the transition occurs via two dipole transitions, but it doesn't specify whether all possible paths are considered. If the total probability is the sum of all possible transition paths, but the options give a single path with a certain probability.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about all possible paths but the specific transition route used. Or maybe each transition has a selection probability, and the total is the product of the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps each transition's probability is |dipole matrix element| squared, and the two-step transition would be the product of each step's probability.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible states and their matrix elements. The allowed dipole transitions depend on the integral of the wavefunctions with the dipole operator.

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m}, where Y are spherical harmonics. The matrix element for a transition from state |n1, l1, m1⟩ to |n2, l2, m2⟩ is proportional to δ_{l2, l1 ±1} and δ_{m2, m1 ±1, 0}.

But more accurately, the integral involves the Gaunt coefficients, which depend on the spherical harmonics involved.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to recall that for each transition step, the probability is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or other factors.

Wait, another approach: when considering the possible transitions from |3,0,0⟩, the first step can go to any of the |2,1,m⟩ with m=-1,0, +1. The second step must then go to |1,0,0⟩.

So for each first transition, the probability to reach |1,0,0⟩ would be the product of the probabilities of each individual step.

But to compute the probabilities, I think each transition's probability is dependent on the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator.

But perhaps the probabilities for the first step to each m are the same. For example, if each m state has the same transition probability from |3,0,0⟩, then each would have a 1/3 chance. But wait, is that the case?

Alternatively, the first transition can have different probabilities for m=-1,0,+1.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{10}, Y_{11}, Y_{1-1}.

Wait, maybe the transition amplitude for each m is:

⟨ 2,1,m | r Y_{1k} | 3,0,0 ⟩.

But the initial state has l=0, so the integral involves Y_{00} and Y_{1k}.

The product Y_{1k} * Y_{00} would involve terms with Y_{1k}, Y_{1k-1}, Y_{1k+1}... wait, but since Y_{00} is a constant, multiplying it by Y_{1k} would just give Y_{1k}.

So the integral for the matrix element would be the integral of Y_{1m} * Y_{1k} * Y_{00} multiplied by some radial parts. Since Y_{00} is 1/(sqrt(4π)), the integral becomes (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1m} Y_{1k}^* dΩ.

Which is (1/(sqrt(4π))) * ∫ Y_{1m} Y_{1k}^* dΩ.

But this integral is zero unless m = -k, because the integral of Y_{l,m} Y_{l',m'} is zero unless l=l' and m=m'.

Wait, no, the integral ∫ Y_{a}^* Y_{b} dΩ is zero unless a = b. So in this case, Y_{1m} * Y_{1k}^* is integrated. So unless m = -k, the integral is zero. Wait, no, because Y_{1k} * Y_{1m} integrated is zero unless k = -m. Or wait, no, the product Y_{1k} Y_{1m} would go into terms of spherical harmonics with l up to 2, but when you integrate over all angles, only the same l and m would contribute.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps for the initial state |3,0,0⟩, the matrix element for transition to |2,1,m⟩ is non-zero only for m = 0, ±1?

Wait, no, because the dipole operator has angular components with l=1, so the transition from l=0 to l=1 would involve m changing by 0, ±1. So the initial m is 0, so the final m can be 0, ±1. Therefore, the possible m's are 0, +1, -1 for each transition.

So the transition matrix elements for each m would be non-zero. But what about the magnitude of each matrix element?

I'm not exactly sure, but maybe the transition probabilities for each m are the same. So the probability for each m is 1/3, because there are three possible m's (0, +1, -1). If that's the case, then the first transition has a 1/3 chance for each m.

But wait, in reality, the probabilities might not be the same for each m. For example, the transition from m=0 to m=0 might have a different probability than m=+1 or -1. Because the integral would depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the Gaunt coefficients.

Wait, I think the selection rules for m are Δm=0, ±1. But the probability for each Δm isn't necessarily the same. So for the initial state |3,0,0⟩, the possible m transitions are to 0, +1, -1. But which of those have non-zero matrix elements?

Wait, more accurately, the matrix element ⟨2,1,m| r Y_{1k} |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero only when m = k, because the initial state has m=0, and Y_{1k} contributes m=k. So the matrix element is non-zero only when m = k.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the integral:

⟨2,1,m| r Y_{1k} |3,0,0⟩ = something that depends on m and k.

But the initial state |3,0,0⟩ is Y_{00}, so the matrix element becomes ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} Y_{00} dΩ.

Wait, the product Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} Y_{00} would be integrated over the sphere. But Y_{00} is 1/(sqrt(4π)). So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} dΩ.

But Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} is proportional to the sum of terms involving Y_{2, m−k}, Y_{0, m−k}, and other terms. But when integrated, only the term where m -k =0 would contribute, because others would integrate to zero. So the integral is non-zero only when m =k.

Wait, no, because the integral of Y_{l1,m1} * Y_{l2,m2} is zero unless m1 = m2. Wait, no, that's not the case. The integral ∫ Y_{a} Y_{b}^* dΩ is zero unless a = b. So in this case, Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} is ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} dΩ. This is zero unless m = -k (since Y_{l,m}^* = (-1)^m Y_{l,-m}).

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the specifics, but maybe an alternative approach is better. Let's think about the possible transitions.

From |3,0,0⟩, the first transition can go to |2,1, m⟩ where m is -1, 0, +1.

Each of these would have a certain transition probability. Let's denote P1 as the probability for each m transition.

But the question is about the total probability for a two-step transition: from 3,0,0 → intermediate → 1,0,0.

Each path's probability would be the product of the probabilities of each step.

Wait, but if each step's probability is the square of the matrix element for that transition, then the total probability for each path is the product of the squares.

But if each first-step transition probability is the same (which I'm not sure about), then the total probability would be 3 times the square of a single path's probability.

But looking at the options, the probabilities given are 1/3, 1/4, and 2/3. So perhaps each first-step has a different probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from 3,0,0 →2,1,0 is more probable than others. But why?

Wait, considering that the dipole operator has components in Y1m for m= -1, 0, +1. The matrix elements for the transitions would vary depending on how well the initial and final states overlap with these Y1m terms.

But the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0, so Y00), and the dipole operator has terms like Y10, Y11, Y1-1. So when the initial state is Y00, the transition amplitudes would involve the product of Y00, Y1m, and the final state which is Y1m. So the integral would depend on the Gaunt coefficients for three spherical harmonics: Y00, Y1m, Y1m.

Wait, the Gaunt integral is zero unless the sum of angular momenta allows it. Hmm, but perhaps for our purposes, the transition for m=0 is more probable.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition to m=0 is allowed, but what about the others?

Wait, let me think of the possible m transitions. The initial state has m=0. The dipole operator has m components of -1, 0, +1. So when you multiply by Y1m, the transition can change m by 0, ±1.

So for each possible m change, the matrix element would be non-zero.

But the question is about the probability, which depends on the square of the matrix element. The matrix elements could be different for m=0, +1, -1.

Wait, but the matrix element for m=0 would involve the integral of Y10 Y10 Y00. Because the initial state is Y00, the dipole operator is Y1k, and the final state is Y1m.

So for the first transition, the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y1m Y1k Y00 dΩ. But since Y00 is 1/(sqrt(4π)), the integral reduces to (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y1m Y1k dΩ.

Wait, but Y1m Y1k is a product of two spherical harmonics, which can be expressed in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or Gaunt integrals.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the exact integral, but perhaps the key point is that the transition probabilities are the same for m=0, +1, -1. If that's the case, then the first transition has three possible paths, each with equal probability. So the probability for each first step is 1/3.

Then, for each of these first steps, the second transition must go to |1,0,0⟩.

So for each first step, the second transition's probability would be... Well, the second step is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Again, the matrix element for this transition would involve the dipole operator. The initial state is |2,1,m⟩, and the dipole operator would change l by ±1. Since we're going from l=1 to l=0, which is Δl = -1. So the dipole operator must have l=1 component.

The selection rules again apply: m can change by 0, ±1.

So the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed only if m' = m ±1 or m. But the final state has m=0.

So for the transition from |2,1,0⟩, the m can change by 0, +1, or -1. But since the final m is 0, the initial m must be 0, +1, or -1.

Wait, no, wait: the transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. So:

- If the initial m is 0, then the final m must be 0, so Δm=0.

- If the initial m is +1, then Δm must be -1 to reach 0.

- If the initial m is -1, then Δm must be +1 to reach 0.

Each of these is allowed, as Δm can be 0, ±1.

So all three possible first steps can lead to the final state.

Assuming that each step's transition probability is the same, which I'm not sure about, but perhaps.

So the first step has probability 1/3 for each m, then the second step would have some probability.

But for each first step, the second step's transition probability depends on the matrix element.

Wait, maybe the second transition's probability is the same for all m.

If so, the total probability for each path would be (1/3) * (p), where p is the probability of the second step.

But how to find p?

Alternatively, perhaps the overall probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible two-step paths.

So total probability would be sum over m of (probability of first step to m) × (probability of second step from m to 0).

If each first step's probability is 1/3, then the total probability would be 3 × (1/3) × p = p, where p is the probability of the second step from each m.

But this is getting complicated; perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, let me think about the possible options given.

Option A says the route is 3,0,0→2,1,0→1,0,0, with probability 1/3.

Option D says the same route, but probability 2/3.

Option B and C have m=+1 and m=-1 in the first step, respectively, with probability 1/4 each.

So if the first step's m=0 is more probable, then the total probability through that path would be higher.

But why would m=0 be more probable?

Wait, maybe the transition for m=0 is more likely because it's symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix elements for m=0 are larger.

Wait, the dipole operator has components in all m directions, but perhaps the transition for m=0 is more probable because it's aligned with the dipole. Or perhaps the matrix elements for m=0 are larger.

Alternatively, considering that the initial state is spherically symmetric, transitions where m=0 are more probable because of symmetry. So perhaps the first transition to m=0 has a higher probability than the others.

If that's the case, then the path via m=0 would have a higher probability.

But without knowing the exact matrix elements, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, but I remember that in hydrogen atom transitions, the transition probability from state |n,l,m⟩ to |n', l±1, m'⟩ is proportional to (2l ±1) for certain conditions. Not sure, but perhaps it's more likely to transition to m=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each m transition is the same, which would mean each path has equal probability. Since there are three possible paths, each would have a probability of 1/3. But since the process is two steps, the total probability would be the sum of each path's probability.

Wait, no. The total probability is not the sum of the path probabilities. Each path is a two-step process, so the total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each individual two-step path.

If each first step is 1/3, and each second step is 1/3, then each two-step path would have probability (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9, and there are three such paths, so total probability 3*(1/9)=1/3. But the options don't have 1/3 as the total, but some options have 1/3 as the probability.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the corresponding probability" for the transition route given. So perhaps the probability refers to the specific two-step path, not the total.

So, for example, option A's path is 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0, and the probability is 1/3. So if the first step has a 1/3 chance, and the second step for that path has a 1/3 chance, then the total for that path is (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9. But option A says the probability is 1/3, which doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the total probability is the sum of the squares of the matrix elements for each possible m. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is allowed, and the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed. So the probability would be multiplying the two transition probabilities.

But without knowing the exact values, perhaps the correct answer is option A, as it's the only one where the first step is m=0, which might have a higher probability.

Wait, I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which has a higher probability, 2/3.

Wait, another thought: the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is more probable because m doesn't change. Let's assume that the first transition's probability is higher when Δm=0.

So, if the transition probabilities are not equal for each m, but favor Δm=0, then the first step would have a higher probability for m=0.

In that case, the first transition to m=0 might have a higher probability, say 1/2, and the other two each have 1/4.

Then, the second transition from m=0 to m=0 would have a certain probability, say 1/2 as well. So the total probability for that path would be (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

But option A says the probability is 1/3, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step's probability for m=0 is 1/2, the others 1/4 each. Then, the second step's probability for each is 1/2, so the total for each path is (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4 for m=0, (1/4)*(1/2) = 1/8 for m=+1 and -1. Summing all three gives 1/4 +1/8 +1/8= 1/2. But the options don't have 1/2.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, I remember that the transition probability for each change in l and m is given by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding angular momenta can determine the transition probabilities.

The dipole transition involves the matrix element of the dipole operator, which is proportional to r Y_{1m}.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ = R_{3,0}(r) Y_{00}.

The intermediate state after first transition is |2,1,m⟩ = R_{2,1}(r) Y_{1m}.

The matrix element for the first transition would involve the integral ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} Y_{00} dΩ.

Wait, but Y_{00} is 1/sqrt(4π), so the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} dΩ.

Which is (1/sqrt(4π)) times the integral, which is zero unless m = -k.

Wait, because Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} = (-1)^m Y_{1,-m} Y_{1k}.

The product of Y_{1,-m} and Y_{1k} can be expressed as a sum over l=0,1,2 of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients multiplied by Y_{l, m +k}.

Wait, but when you integrate over all angles, only the term where l=1 will contribute, but that requires m +k =0? Maybe I'm not getting this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is zero unless m +k =0, because Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} = something that has terms in Y_{0,0} only when m +k =0.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} can have terms for l=0, 1, 2. For example, Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} can be expressed as a sum over l and m', involving terms like Y_{l, m'} where m' = m +k.

So, when you multiply them together, the integral over all angles will be non-zero only when l=0 and m' =0, because Y_{00} is the only spherical harmonic with m'=0 and l=0.

Wait, but in our case, the integral is ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} Y_{00} dΩ.

Which is ∫ [Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k}] Y_{00} dΩ.

Since Y_{00} is 1/sqrt(4π), the integral becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} dΩ.

Which is (1/sqrt(4π)) times the integral of Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k}.

Which is zero unless m = -k.

Wait, because Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} is proportional to Y_{0, m +k} + Y_{2, m +k} + ... and when you integrate, only Y_{0,0} contributes. So m +k must be zero.

So m = -k.

So for the matrix element to be non-zero, k = -m.

Wait, but the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1k}, so in the initial transition, the allowed m values are those where m = -k, where k can be 0, ±1.

So for each m, k must be -m. So for m=0, k=0; for m=+1, k=-1; for m=-1, k=+1.

So the transitions are:

m=0 → k=0 → allowed.

m=+1 → k=-1 → allowed.

m=-1 → k=+1 → allowed.

So all three transitions are allowed.

Now, the matrix element for each transition would be proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining Y_{1m} and Y_{1k} to get Y_{00}.

Wait, the integral of Y_{1m}^* Y_{1k} Y_{00} dΩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding the two angular momenta 1 and 1 to get 0.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding two l=1 states to get l=0 is non-zero only when m1 + m2 =0.

In our case, m = -k, so m +k =0. So the integral is non-zero and proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining two l=1 states with m1 = m and m2 = k (but k=-m) to get l=0, m=0 is given by:

⟨ 1, m; 1, -m | 0, 0 ⟩.

The value of this coefficient is known. For example, when m =0, the coefficient is 1. When m=1, the coefficient is - (1/√2) (something?), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, let me think. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states to get l=0 are only non-zero when m1 + m2 =0.

The coefficients are as follows:

For l=0, m=0:

⟨1, m1; 1, m2 | 0, 0⟩ = 0 unless m1 + m2 =0.

So:

- For m1=0, m2=0: the coefficient is 1.

- For m1=1, m2=-1: the coefficient is (1/√2).

- For m1=-1, m2=1: the coefficient is (1/√2).

Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into l=0:

The general formula for ⟨l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M⟩.

When L=0, M=0, the only possible combinations are when m1 + m2 =0.

The coefficients are:

- For m1=0, m2=0: ⟨1,0;1,0|0,0⟩= 1.

- For m1=1, m2=-1: ⟨1,1;1,-1|0,0⟩= (1/√2).

- For m1=-1, m2=1: ⟨1,-1;1,1|0,0⟩= (1/√2).

So the integral for the matrix element is proportional to these coefficients. Therefore, the transition probabilities are proportional to the square of these coefficients.

So for each transition:

- m=0: coefficient is 1 → probability proportional to 1² =1.

- m=1: coefficient is (1/√2) → probability proportional to 1/2.

- m=-1: coefficient is (1/√2) → probability proportional to 1/2.

So the three possible m transitions have probabilities proportional to 1, 0.5, 0.5.

So the total probability would be 1 + 0.5 +0.5 = 2.

But the actual probabilities would be normalized by dividing by 2. So:

P(m=0) = (1) / (2) = 1/2.

P(m=+1) = (0.5)/2 = 1/4.

P(m=-1)= (0.5)/2 = 1/4.

So the first transition probabilities are:

- m=0: 1/2.

- m=+1: 1/4.

- m=-1: 1/4.

So now, for each first step, the second transition must occur.

The second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Again, the matrix element for this transition would involve the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The initial state is |2,1,m⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩.

The dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1k}, so the matrix element is proportional to:

⟨1,0 | Y_{1k} | 2,1,m ⟩.

Which is proportional to the integral of Y_{10}^* Y_{1k} Y_{1m} dΩ.

Wait, because the initial state is Y_{1m}, and the dipole operator is Y_{1k}, and the final state is Y_{00}.

Wait, no, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, which is Y_{10}.

Wait, I think I need to reevaluate.

The second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element is ⟨1,0 | r Y_{1k} |2,1,m⟩.

Which is proportional to ∫ Y_{10}^* Y_{1k} Y_{1m} dΩ.

Again, this would involve the product of three spherical harmonics. The integral is non-zero only if certain conditions are met.

The product Y_{1k} Y_{1m} can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics with l=0,1,2.

The integral ∫ Y_{10}^* Y_{1k} Y_{1m} dΩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨1, m; 1, k | 0, 0⟩, but only when the sum of the angular momenta can produce l=1.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the integral is zero unless the angular momentum addition allows it.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the matrix element as being non-zero only if m +k =0, because the final state has m=0.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Maybe it's easier to think that the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed only if m' = m ±1 or 0, but since the final m is 0, the initial m must be 0, ±1.

So for each m in |2,1,m⟩, the allowed transitions are:

- m=0: can go to m'=0 (Δm=0).

- m=+1: can go to m'=0 (Δm= -1).

- m=-1: can go to m'=0 (Δm= +1).

So for each initial m, the transition is allowed.

Now, the probability for the second transition would be proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients involved.

Assuming that the second transition's probabilities are the same for each m, or perhaps vary based on m.

But let me proceed.

Assuming that the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ has a probability proportional to (1/2), regardless of m. Or perhaps the probabilities are the same for each m.

Wait, but let's use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients again.

The transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ would involve combining l=1 and l=1 to reach l=0.

Wait, no, the dipole operator has l=1, and the initial state has l=1. The final state has l=0, which is a change of Δl= -1. So the transition is allowed.

The matrix element is ∫ Y_{10}^* Y_{1k} Y_{1m} dΩ.

Which would be non-zero only if m +k =0, because the final state has m=0.

Wait, but how? Because Y_{10}^* Y_{1k} Y_{1m} must combine to a spherical harmonic with m=0.

Wait, this is getting too complicated for me. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities for the second transition are the same for each m. So the second transition's probability is the same, say p, regardless of the initial m.

In that case, the total probability for each two-step path would be (probability of first step) × p.

So, the total probability would be:

P_total = (P1_0 × p) + (P1_+1 × p) + (P1_-1 × p)

= p × (P1_0 + P1_+1 + P1_-1 )

Since P1_0 =1/2, P1_+1=1/4, P1_-1=1/4.

So sum is 1/2 +1/4 +1/4 =1.

So P_total = p ×1 = p.

But the options don't have p as part of the given. Alternatively, perhaps each step's probability is normalized.

Wait, but the problem only asks about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So perhaps each option gives a specific two-step path and its probability.

So, for example, option A's path is 3,0,0→2,1,0→1,0,0 with probability 1/3.

But according to our earlier calculation, the first step's probability is 1/2, and if the second step's probability is 1/2, then the path's total probability is (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4. But option A says 1/3.

This doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition's probability is the same for all m and is 1/3. Then, each two-step path's probability would be (1/2) * (1/3) =1/6 for m=0, and (1/4)*(1/3)=1/12 for m=+1 and -1. The sum would be 1/6 + 2*(1/12) )= 1/6 +1/6=1/3. But the options don't directly reflect this.

Wait, but the question is about the probability for a specific two-step path, not the total.

So option A says that the probability is 1/3 for the path via m=0.

But according to our earlier calculations, the first step's probability is 1/2, and if the second step's probability is also 1/2, then the total for that path is (1/2)*(1/2) =1/4, which doesn't match option A's 1/3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step's probability depends on the initial m.

Wait, for the second step, from |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the transition is allowed if m =0, Δm=0; m=+1, Δm=-1; m=-1, Δm=+1.

Now, the probability for each of these second steps would be proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

For example:

- For m=0: the coefficient is 1 → probability 1.

- For m=+1: the coefficient is (1/√2) → probability 1/2.

- For m=-1: the coefficient is (1/√2) → probability 1/2.

So the second step's probabilities are:

- m=0: 1 → probability 1.

- m=+1: 1/2.

- m=-1: 1/2.

So the probabilities for each second step are:

P_second(m) = 1, 1/2, 1/2 for m=0, +1, -1 respectively.

So the total probability for each two-step path would be:

- Path via m=0: (1/2) *1 =1/2.

- Path via m=+1: (1/4) * (1/2) =1/8.

- Path via m=-1: (1/4) * (1/2)=1/8.

Adding these up: 1/2 +1/8 +1/8 = 1/2 + 1/4= 3/4.

But the options don't have 3/4.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the first step's probabilities are:

P1(m=0) =1/2.

P1(m=+1)=1/4.

P1(m=-1)=1/4.

The second step's probabilities for each m are:

P2(m=0) =1.

P2(m=+1) =1/2.

P2(m=-1)=1/2.

So the total probability for each path is:

P_total = sum over m [ P1(m) * P2(m) ]

= (1/2 *1) + (1/4 *1/2) + (1/4 *1/2)

= (1/2) + (1/8) + (1/8) )

= 1/2 + 2/8 = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.

But none of the options have 3/4. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step's probabilities are all 1, meaning that any allowed transition occurs with probability 1. If that's the case, the total probability would be 1/2 +1/4 +1/4 =1.

But the options don't have this either.

At this point, I'm getting stuck and perhaps need to refer back to the options.

Looking at the options, only options A and D involve m=0 in the first transition.

Option A: Path is 3,0,0 →2,1,0→1,0,0, probability 1/3.

Option D: Same path, probability 2/3.

If the first step's probability is 1/2, and the second step's probability is 1, then the total for this path is 1/2. But option D is 2/3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition's probability is 1/3 for each m, so the path via m=0 has probability 1/3, and the second step's probability is 1, leading to 1/3, which would match option A.

But earlier analysis suggested that the first transition's probabilities are 1/2, 1/4, 1/4 for m=0, +1, -1 respectively.

But perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the probabilities for the first transition are the same for all m. So each has a probability of 1/3.

In that case, the total probability for each two-step path would be (1/3) × P2(m).

But what is P2(m)?

If all P2(m) are the same, say p, then each two-step path would have a probability of (1/3)*p.

But without knowing p, perhaps the given options suggest that the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, as it has a higher probability.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Another approach: think of the possible allowed transitions.

The given options are:

A) 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0, probability 1/3.

B) 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

C) 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

D) 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0, probability 2/3.

So the options suggest that the probabilities are either 1/3, 1/4, or 2/3.

From earlier, the first transition's probabilities are 1/2, 1/4, 1/4 for m=0, +1, -1.

Assuming that for each first step, the second transition's probability is 1, the total would be 1/2 + 1/4 +1/4=1, but none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step's probability is 1/2 for m=0 and 1 for others.

Wait, that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step's probability is 1 for m=0, and zero for others. But that's not possible because the transitions for m=+1 and -1 are allowed.

Wait, but perhaps the dipole operator allows transitions with m=0 only.

No, because the dipole operator has components for all m.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step is more probable for m=0.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps it's best to conclude that the correct answer is option A, as the path via m=0 is the most probable, and the probability is 1/3.

But I'm not very confident.


The problem involves the decay of the hydrogen atom state \(|3,0,0\rangle\) to \(|1,0,0\rangle\) via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are \(\Delta l = \pm 1\) and \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\). Starting from \(|3,0,0\rangle\), the first transition must go to a state with \(l=1\) (\(n=2\)), and the second transition must go to \(|1,0,0\rangle\). The possible intermediate states are \(|2,1,-1\rangle\), \(|2,1,0\rangle\), and \(|2,1,1\rangle\), corresponding to \(m = -1, 0, +1\), respectively.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition Probabilities**:
   - The transition probabilities from \(|3,0,0\rangle\) to \(|2,1,m\rangle\) depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. These coefficients determine the overlap between the initial state, the dipole operator, and the intermediate state.
   - The probabilities for the first transition are proportional to the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For \(m = 0\), the coefficient is \(1\), and for \(m = \pm 1\), the coefficients are \(\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\). Normalizing these probabilities gives:
     \[
     P_1(m=0) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P_1(m=\pm 1) = \frac{1}{4}.
     \]

2. **Second Transition Probabilities**:
   - From \(|2,1,m\rangle\) to \(|1,0,0\rangle\), the transition is allowed for \(m = 0, \pm 1\), with probabilities dependent on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining \(l=1\) states into \(l=0\). The probabilities for the second transition are:
     \[
     P_2(m=0) = 1, \quad P_2(m=\pm 1) = \frac{1}{2}.
     \]

3. **Total Probability for Each Path**:
   - The total probability for each two-step path is the product of the probabilities of the first and second transitions:
     \[
     P_{\text{total}}(m=0) = P_1(m=0) \cdot P_2(m=0) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2},
     \]
     \[
     P_{\text{total}}(m=\pm 1) = P_1(m=\pm 1) \cdot P_2(m=\pm 1) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}.
     \]
   - Summing these probabilities gives the total decay probability:
     \[
     P_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{5}{8}.
     \]

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: The path \(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle\) has a probability of \(\frac{1}{3}\). This does not match the calculated probability for this path, \(\frac{1}{2}\).
   - **Option B**: The path \(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,1\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle\) has a probability of \(\frac{1}{4}\). This matches the calculated probability for this path, \(\frac{1}{8}\), but the total probability is not \(\frac{1}{4}\).
   - **Option C**: The path \(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,-1\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle\) has a probability of \(\frac{1}{4}\). This matches the calculated probability for this path, \(\frac{1}{8}\), but the total probability is not \(\frac{1}{4}\).
   - **Option D**: The path \(|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle\) has a probability of \(\frac{2}{3}\). This does not match the calculated probability for this path, \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Conclusion:
The most likely answer is **Option A**, as it corresponds to the most probable path (\(m=0\)) and provides a reasonable approximation for the probability. However, the exact match to the calculated probabilities is not perfect, and the reasoning involves approximations.
