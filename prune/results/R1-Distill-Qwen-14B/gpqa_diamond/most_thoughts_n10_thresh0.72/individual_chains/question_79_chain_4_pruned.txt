Alright, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, the question is about identifying Compound X after a reaction. The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, what's that reagent used for? Oh right, that's a common catalyst for epoxidation reactions, especially using peracids. Oh wait, but the compound X is reacting with it, so maybe X is an alkene that's being epoxidized. So the product would be an epoxide.

The theoretical NMR data of the product is given. Let's look at the 1H and 13C NMR.

Starting with the 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): That's a singlet for 3H, probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded. Maybe attached to an epoxide? Or perhaps a substituent on a benzene ring.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet for 3H, so another methyl group. Wait, is that two separate methyl groups? Both singlets, so no splitting, which suggests they're each attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like a quaternary carbon or maybe a symmetrical structure.
- The rest are aromatic protons. Let's see: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So four peaks in the aromatic region. Let me think about the coupling. A doublet of 1H and 2H each. Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic system with substituents causing coupling. Or perhaps a substituted styrene?

Wait, the product is an epoxide. So the starting material X was something with a double bond, which was epoxidized. The reaction would add an oxygen across the double bond, creating an epoxide ring.

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: So the oxirane (epoxide) is at position 2, with a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is a benz
