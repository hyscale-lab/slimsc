Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to parse the structure. So, looking at the formula, it's a hydrocarbon with several substituents. I notice there are double bonds in there; specifically, I think there are two C=C double bonds. Let me count the atoms... Well, maybe the exact structure isn't crucial for the enthalpy calculation, but perhaps the bonds are.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies. Oh right, enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula I remember is that the enthalpy of formation (Î”Hf) is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products, but wait, no. Wait, I think it's the other way around. Oh wait, no, wait. When forming a molecule from its constituent atoms, you have to break bonds in the reactants and form bonds in the products. So, the standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change as the sum of the energies of the bonds in the product molecules minus the sum of the bonds in the reactant molecules. But wait, another way I remember is using the enthalpy of atom
