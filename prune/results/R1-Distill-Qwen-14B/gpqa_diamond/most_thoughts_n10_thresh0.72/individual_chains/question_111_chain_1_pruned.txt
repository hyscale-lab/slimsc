Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. The question presents two separate reactions, A and B, and gives four options to choose from. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, which usually suggests an elimination reaction or maybe an aldol addition? Wait, but when a ketone reacts with an acrylate ester, I think it's about conjugate addition or maybe a Michael addition? Oh wait, no, wait—Michael addition is when a nucleophile attacks a beta, gamma-unsaturated carbonyl. But here, ethyl acrylate is the Michael donor, perhaps? Or is it acting as an electrophile?

Wait, the starting material is a ketone—2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1, and substituents at 2 and 6. Position 1 is a ketone, so that's the carbonyl group. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. Oh, wait, position 2: two substituents—ethyl and methyl. And position 6 is another methyl. So the ring would have a ketone at position 1, ethyl and methyl at position 2, and methyl at position 6. So the structure is a cyclohexanone with substituents in specific positions.

When this reacts with ethyl acrylate in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, I think it's about a conjugate addition (Michael addition) or maybe a Claisen-like condensation. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates the alpha position to form an enolate, which then attacks the acrylate.

Wait, another possibility is that the acrylate is acting as a nucleophile. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an ester. The structure is CH₂=CH-CO-OEt. So the acrylate is a good Michael donor because
