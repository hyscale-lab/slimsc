Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin, and muons are elementary particles with spin-1/2, right? So their spin operators should be 2x2 matrices.

The question says that the Y-component of the operator, Ay, is given as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

Wait, I think the Pauli matrices are similar. Let me recall: the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix. Oh, right! So Ay = c * S. And c is h/(4π). 

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the options don't directly ask for the eigenvalues; I need to think about the statements provided.

Let me first figure out the eigenvalues of Ay. The matrix Ay is c times S. Since S is a Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are ±1. So when I multiply by c, the eigenvalues become c*(±1).

So c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues a are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So a = ±h/(4π). Wait, but wait—Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so yes. But h/(4π) multiplied by these gives the eigenvalues of Ay as ±h/(4π). 

Looking at the options, let's check each one. 

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, how can the eigenvalues have imaginary parts? Wait, the eigenvalues are real because Ay is Hermitian. Because S is Hermitian, since S† = S because the matrix is [[0,i], [-i,0]] which is same as S. Because S† would be first row [0, i], second row [-i, 0], but wait S is [[0, -i],
