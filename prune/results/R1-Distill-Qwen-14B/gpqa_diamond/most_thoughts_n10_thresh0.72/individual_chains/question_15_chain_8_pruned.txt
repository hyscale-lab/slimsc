Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so that the researchers can prioritize their observation. Let me break down the information I have.

First, both planets are Earth-like, meaning they're probably similar in size, but I don't know their exact radii. The important thing here is that transiting probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is closer to edge-on, which allows it to pass in front of its star from our perspective.

Wait, but how do we calculate the transit probability? I remember that the probability (p) is approximately equal to R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, that's the geometric probability. Oh right, the formula is roughly p = (R*) / a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, that's a simplification because the exact formula involves the impact parameter and the inclination, but since we don't know the inclination, we assume random orientations, leading to that geometric probability.

So, to compute the probability, I need to find R* / a for each planet. But wait, the problem gives the orbital periods instead of the semi-major axes. So I need to find a way to get a from the period and the star's mass.

The formula for the semi-major axis comes from Kepler's third law. The law is P^2 = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets are Earth-like, their mass is negligible compared to the star's mass. So, M+m ≈ M. Thus, the equation simplifies to P² = (4π²/(G M)) * a³. We can rearrange this to find a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a = cube root( (G M P²)/(4π²) ).

Alternatively, in terms of solar units, I remember that Kepler's law is often written as P² = a³ / (M_star), when P is in years, a in AU, and M_star is in solar masses. Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Let me think again.

The more precise version in SI units. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to compare the two planets without getting into the actual numbers. Let me think about the ratio of a1 (Planet_1's semi-major axis) and a2 (Planet_2's semi-major axis).

Given that both planets have the same mass, but different periods and different host star masses. The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

Wait, no. The problem states that Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P_1 = (1/3) P_2.

So, let me write the Kepler equation for both:

For Planet 1: P1² = (4π²/(G M1)) a1³

For Planet 2: P2² = (4π²/(G M2)) a2³

Dividing the two equations: (P1² / P2²) = (M2 / M1) (a2³ / a1³)

Because P1 = P2/3, so P1² = P2² / 9. So substituting:

( (P2²/9) ) / P2² = (M2 / M1) * (a2³ / a1³ )

Simplify the left side: (1/9) = (M2/M1) * (a2³/a1³ )

We know M1 is twice M2. So M1 = 2 M2 → M2 = M1/2.

So plug that in:

1/9 = ( (M1/2) / M1 ) * (a2³/a1³ )

Simplify the M terms: (1/2) * (a2³/a1³ ) = 1/9

So (a2³/a1³ ) = (1/9) * 2 = 2/9

Take cube roots: a2/a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6

Wait, (2/9) is about 0.222. The cube root of that is approximately 0.606, so a2 ≈ 0.606 * a1.

Alternatively, let's compute it numerically. 2/9 is about 0.2222. So (0.2222)^(1/3) is about 0.606. So a2 ≈ 0.606 a1.

But wait, I'm trying to find a1 in terms of a2 or vice versa. Let me rearrange:

a2³ = (2/9) a1³ → a1³ = (9/2) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (9/2)^(1/3)

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the equation:

(1/9) = ( (M2/M1) ) * (a2³ / a1³ )

M2 is half of M1, so M2 = M1/2.

Thus, substituting gives:

(1/9) = ( (1/2) ) * (a2³ / a1³ )

Multiply both sides by 2:

2/9 = a2³/a1³ → a2³ = (2/9) a1³ → a2 = a1 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Which is approximately a2 ≈ a1 * 0.606.

So
