Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of the major isomer of product 3. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think through what I remember.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with cyclooctatetraene. First, it's heated with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with methanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid to get product 2. Finally, product 2 is heated with cyclopentadiene to form product 3. I need to find out what product 3 looks like, particularly its major isomer.

Let me start by recalling the reactions involved here.

First Reaction: Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic Anhydride â†’ Product 1

Cyclooctatetraene is a conjugated cyclic diene. When it reacts with maleic anhydride, I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. Maleic anhydride is a dienophile. The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds. So, cyclooctatetraene has four double bonds, but when it reacts, it probably uses two adjacent double bonds as the diene part. Wait, but cyclooctatetraene is a bicyclic compound? Or is it a monocyclic with eight-membered ring? Oh wait, cyclooctatetraene is a monocyclic eight-membered ring with four double bonds, making it a conjugated system. But wait, for a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene needs to be conjugated and in s-cis conformation. So, cyclooctatetraene can act as a diene, but perhaps each double bond is part of a conjugated system. Wait, maybe the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition with maleic anhydride as the dienophile.

Product 1 would then be a bicyclic structure, perhaps a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative because the Diels-Alder adds two rings. Alternatively, since cyclooct
