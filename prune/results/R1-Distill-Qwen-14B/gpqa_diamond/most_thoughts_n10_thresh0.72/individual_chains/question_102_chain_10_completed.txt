Okay, let's try to tackle this question. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step. So, the question is about a genetic construct and why a green signal isn't observed in the offspring when visualized under a confocal microscope.

First, let me go through the setup. The experiment involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic vectors have two coding regions (two ORFs) under a single promoter, right? So this vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end and the receptor ORF at the 3'. Each is fused to different fluorescent proteins: mCherry and eGFP, respectively.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor would be translated as a separate ORF after the ligand's translation, because the ribosome can initiate at the IRES without needing a termination codon. Wait, no, IRES is used in some vectors to allow for the expression of two proteins from a single mRNA. So the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is probably after the ligand's stop codon.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but between them is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, the receptor is fused to eGFP, but between them is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. When Cre is present, it excises the stop cassette, allowing the ORFs to be in frame. So, if the Cre is active, the stop would be removed, and the mCherry would be expressed along with the ligand, and similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

In the experiment, antibodies were made against the overexpressed proteins and used in a Western blot. But the question is about the mouse model. The mice are homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they're crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so I bet the Cre is under the control of SOX10, meaning it's active in neural crest-derived cells.

After the offspring are born, they're visualized under a confocal microscope looking for green signal, which would come from eGFP. But they don't see it. Why?

Possible options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. If the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, the receptor would be on those cells, not the ones expressing the ligand. But I'm not sure how that would affect the GFP expression. Maybe the construct isn't expressed where needed? Not sure yet.

B) Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't trafficked to the cell surface, it might not fluoresce. But why would it be stuck? If the construct is faulty. But the question is about the expression in the right cells.

C) Enhancer missing. The construct might not have the right regulatory elements. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which should allow expression. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't sufficient. But the problem is in the offspring, not in the initial expression in culture.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORFs aren't in frame after stop cassette removal, then perhaps the eGFP isn't properly expressed. But wait, the stop cassettes have loxP and lox2272, which are different sites. Cre would recognize loxP (if it's the standard Cre), and maybe another system for lox2272? Or perhaps the loxP and lox2272 are used to excise the stop cassettes only when Cre is present.

Wait, the construct is a bicistronic vector with two stop cassettes. The ligand is 5' with a stop in loxP, and the receptor is 3' with a stop in lox2272. So in the absence of Cre, these stops prevent read-through. When Cre is introduced, it should recombine and remove the stops, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

So in the mice, SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells. When the mice are crossed with the homozygous construct, the Cre should excise the stops at the appropriate lox sites. So the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But in the offspring, no green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct, meaning the two ORFs are on the same transcript. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which allows for its expression.

When Cre is active, the loxP sites in the ligand's stop cassette should be excised, so the ligand and mCherry are expressed together. Similarly, the lox2272 in the receptor's stop cassette would be excised, so receptor and eGFP are expressed together.

So why no eGFP? Let's think about the expression. If the Cre isn't active in the cells where the construct is, then the stops remain, and the ORFs aren't expressed. But the SOX10-Cre is supposed to be active in neural crest cells, which are where the ligand and receptor were initially expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse model, the construct is placed into the genome. The SOX10-Cre mice have Cre under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So when the construct is in the mouse, the Cre would be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, excising the stop cassettes and allowing expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But in the offspring, when they're visualized, no green. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Possible issues: Maybe the IRES isn't working properly. Or maybe the eGFP isn't being correctly translated. Or maybe the stop cassette in the receptor isn't being excised.

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 are different. So the Cre used must recognize both. But standard Cre recombinase only recognizes loxP sites. Lox2272 is a variant that requires a different Cre (like Dre or something else) maybe. Wait, no, lox2272 is another variant, but I think standard Cre can't recombine it. Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Cre binds to loxP sites, but lox2272 is a mutated site that requires a different Cre, like Dre. So if the construct uses lox2272 for the receptor's stop cassette, and the Cre is only loxP-specific, then the lox2272 wouldn't be cut. So the stop cassette in the receptor would remain, so the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Ah, that rings a bell. So in the vector, the ligand's stop is between ligand and mCherry, and it's a loxP cassette. The receptor's stop is between receptor and eGFP, and it's a lox2272 cassette.

SOX10-Cre is probably providing a Cre that can only cut loxP sites. So when the Cre is introduced into the mouse, it would excise the loxP stops in the ligand, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 stops in the receptor's cassette wouldn't be cut because standard Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. So the receptor-eGFP would not be expressed.

Thus, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no green signal. That would explain the result.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But if the stop isn't excised, they're not even expressed. So that's not the issue.

Option B is about the receptor being stuck in the Golgi. That's a trafficking issue, but I don't see evidence pointing to that.

Option C is about enhancer missing. The ligand is under CBA, which is a promoter, not necessarily needing enhancers. But if the enhancer was missing, the ligand wouldn't be expressed either. But in the Western blot, when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, perhaps both proteins were expressed? The question says the expression was tested on Western blot after plasmid transfection, but the result is only about the mouse.

So in the mouse model, the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette isn't excised, so the receptor and eGFP aren't translated.

Wait, but the ligand's stop is in loxP, which would be excised by Cre. So the ligand and mCherry would be expressed. But the question is about the receptor. So the ligand might be expressed, but the receptor isn't.

But the question is why isn't the eGFP expressed. So the reason is that the lox2272 stop cassette isn't being cut, so the receptor and eGFP remain under a stop codon.

So the problem is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains. Thus, the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this reasoning.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would happen if the stop isn't excised, but that's not a framing issue. The stop would prevent expression. So option D is not the best fit.

Option C says enhancer is missing, but again, the ligand is under CBA promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is a regulatory element. So enhancer's absence would affect both, but in the mouse, maybe the ligand is expressed but the receptor isn't.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't working. So the most likely reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't being excised by Cre, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

Wait, but the options given don't directly state that. Looking at the options again:

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is excised, the ORF is disrupted. But if the stop isn't excised, the ORF isn't even initiated.

Wait, the stop cassette is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So the receptor is followed by stop, then eGFP. When Cre excises the stop, the receptor and eGFP are in frame. If they're not in frame, it would be a problem. But how would that happen? It would depend on the cloning. If the lox sites are correctly placed, then the ORFs would be in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is inserted in the wrong frame, so when the stop is removed, the receptor is followed by eGFP but out of frame, leading to a frameshift and a nonfunctional protein. But this seems less likely than the stop cassette not being excised.

Wait, but the question is why there's no green signal. If the stop isn't excised, eGFP isn't made at all. If not in frame, perhaps a truncated protein is made, which might not fluoresce, but it's less likely than the stop being there.

So the most likely reason is that the stop cassette isn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But in the setup, the Cre is supposed to be able to excise the stops.

Wait, but the two stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. The Cre used (from SOX10-Cre) might only recognize loxP. So the lox2272 stop wouldn't be cut, meaning that the receptor and eGFP are not expressed.

So the problem is that the lox2272 site isn't being excised because the Cre can't cut it. Hence, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, which one says that the enhancer is missing? No, the issue is about the cre's ability to excise the stop cassette.

Wait, the options don't directly address the lox sites. Let me re-read the options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would cause a problem if the stop is excised. But if the stop isn't excised, then the eGFP isn't made. So maybe the real issue is that the stop isn't excised, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't working. The IRES is between the ligand and the receptor. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed. But IRES allows for translation of the second ORF. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and then the IRES would drive translation of the receptor and eGFP. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But why would that happen? Because of the stop cassette? Or perhaps the IRES is not working because of the construct's design.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, but the options don't directly address that.

Looking again at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in paracrine. If they are, then the ligand is secreted and acts on another cell's receptor. But that doesn't directly affect the expression of GFP in the same cell.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would prevent surface expression, but the problem is the lack of expression entirely. The Western blot would show the protein, but in the confocal, you wouldn't see it because it's not at the surface. But the question states that the blot was done on total proteins, which would detect it regardless of location. The Western blot result isn't mentioned in the mouse model part, only that the offspring didn't show green.

Wait, the question says after the mouse is born, they are visualized, but the Western blot was done on the transfected plasmid into astrocyte culture. So perhaps the expression in culture worked, but in the mouse, something is wrong.

So the problem in the mouse is that the eGFP isn't expressed, but mCherry (from ligand) might be. But the question's result is no green.

So the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette isn't excised. Which would happen if the Cre can't cut the lox2272 site.

But the options don't mention that. So perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame. So option D says they're not in frame.

Wait, another thought. If the Cre is active, it excises the loxP stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But for the receptor, the stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. Hence, no green.

But why would that be the case? Because the Cre can't cut lox2272. So the problem is that only the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but not the receptor and eGFP. Hence, no green.

But the options don't have an option that says that. So perhaps the intended answer is D, receptor and eGFP not in frame.

Wait, no. If the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't made at all. So the lack of GFP would be because the stop isn't excised, not because of frame issues.

But the options don't have that as an option. So perhaps the correct reasoning is that the Cre didn't excise the stop, due to the lox2272 not being compatible. But none of the options mention this.

Alternatively, maybe the vector wasn't correctly designed. For example, the stop cassettes are in the wrong orientation or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES didn't function, but that's a different issue.

Wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. So after the ligand is translated, the ribosome can terminate, but the IRES allows for the translation of the receptor. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed via IRES.

But if the IRES isn't working, then the receptor isn't expressed. But why would that be the case? Because it's under the same promoter as the ligand.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression of the receptor requires the IRES to function, but if the IRES is in a lox2272 cassette that isn't excised, it might not work.

Wait, if the IRES is part of the stop cassette, then when Cre excises it, the IRES is gone, and the receptor is not expressed. Hmm, no, that can't be.

Wait, the way the construct is described: the ligand is 5', then a stop in a loxP cassette; then the receptor is 3', with a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the mRNA is ligand followed by IRES followed by receptor.

Wait, no, the IRES is in the construct between the ligand and the receptor. So perhaps the structure is: [5'] CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop cassette (loxP) -> IRES -> receptor ORF -> stop cassette (lox2272) -> eGFP [3'].

Wait, perhaps that's the arrangement. So when Cre is present, the loxP stop is excised, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. Then, the IRES allows the receptor and eGFP to be expressed. But for the receptor and eGFP, the stop cassette is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

So the answer would be that the Cre can't excise the lox2272, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly address this.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would cause a problem if the stop is excised, but perhaps if the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed at all. So that's not D's issue.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship, so the ligand is expressed in one cell and the receptor in another, but the construct is such that both are expressed in the same cell. But that wouldn't directly prevent eGFP expression.

Wait, the question states that the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. If the construct is in a cell where Cre is active, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would be expressed. But the issue is with eGFP.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette isn't excised. So the problem is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272.

But the answer options don't include this. So perhaps the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the vectors are not correctly spliced, leading to the eGFP not being expressed.

Wait, another thought: the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. The IRES requires the presence of a functional ribosome. If the IRES isn't working, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why would the IRES not function? Because of some mutation or incorrect cloning.

But the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, implying that the construct worked when transfected into cells, but not in the mouse. So in the mouse, perhaps the IRES isn't working. But why? Because the Cre activity is affecting it?

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't compatible with the lox2272 sites. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, considering that the Western blot showed expression proportional to actin loading. So the total protein is fine. So perhaps the issue is with the detection method, like eGFP not being expressed, but mCherry is. But the confocal is looking for eGFP.

So the most plausible answer is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette in lox2272 isn't cut. But the options don't directly say that. Among the given options, the one that would prevent eGFP expression is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to no expression. But this is not the same as the stop cassette not being excised. Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre, so the stop is never removed, leading to no eGFP expression. So the correct reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't being cut, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the IRES isn't working, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The stop cassettes are in between the ORFs. So when Cre is present, it excises the stop cassettes, allowing the ORFs to be expressed. If the lox sites are different, perhaps the Cre can't excise both stops. 

Wait, the ligand's stop is in loxP, so Cre (loxP-specific) would cut it, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, which requires a different Cre. So the Cre from SOX10-Cre doesn't cut lox2272. So the stop remains, and the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

Thus, the eGFP isn't made because the stop isn't excised. So the reason is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272 site, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But none of the options directly refer to this. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the IRES isn't functional, but again, that's not among the options.

Looking at the options again, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the IRES is present but the stop isn't excised, then the ORFs are not linked, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is excised, but the ORFs are out of frame, you get a truncated, nonfunctional protein. But in that case, the Western blot would show a band, but the confocal wouldn't fluoresce. However, the question states that the construct was tested on the Western blot after plasmid transfection, but it doesn't mention the result in the mouse. So perhaps in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't cut, leading to no expression.

But among the given options, the only possible one is option D, which would cause no eGFP expression. Alternatively, option C says the enhancer is missing. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, so enhancer might not be necessary. However, the receptor is under IRES, which is a regulatory element. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor isn't expressed. But why would that be? Because of the stop, perhaps.

I think I'm going in circles here. The most plausible answer is that the Cre can't cut the lox2272, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But since that's not an option, the next best fit is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. However, I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another thought: the lox sites are used to excise the stop cassettes. If the loxP and lox2272 are in the same orientation, the Cre would excise the cassettes. If they are in opposite orientations, perhaps the excision isn't possible. But the question doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 stop cassette isn't correctly placed, so when Cre is introduced, it doesn't excise it. But again, the options don't cover that.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't made. But the option D suggests a different reason, which is frame shift.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassette isn't excised, but the ORFs are in frame. That would mean the eGFP isn't expressed. But the Western blot in the mouse would show the eGFP? Or not? Hmm.

If the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed, so the Western wouldn't detect it. But the question says that the Western was done on the primary astrocyte culture after plasmid transfection. So the construct worked there. So the problem is in the mouse model, not the transfected cells. So the stop in the mouse construct isn't being excised.

But the question is why. The only possible answer from the options is D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the lox2272 site isn't being cut, so the stop remains. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is inserted in the wrong reading frame relative to the receptor.

Wait, if the eGFP is inserted in a different frame, then when the stop is excised, the receptor would be followed by eGFP in a different frame, leading to a frameshift and a nonfunctional protein. So the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce because it's not properly expressed. But in that case, the Western blot would show a protein, but it might be a different size.

But the question states that the expression was tested on the Western blot after plasmid transfection. So in the plasmid, maybe the eGFP is in frame, but in the mouse construct, it's not. Alternatively, perhaps the mouse construct was not correctly cloned, leading to the eGFP being out of frame.

But this all feels a bit too speculative. Given the options, I think the intended answer is D, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is that the IRES is not functional, but that's not an option.

Wait, the IRES is between the ligand and the receptor. The ligand is under CBA, the receptor under IRES. So when Cre is present, the ligand is expressed, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. If the IRES is non-functional, the receptor isn't expressed. But why would that be? Perhaps because the stop isn't excised. No, I think the stop cassettes are separate.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of which option is correct.

The correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, no. If the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no fluorescence. But the option D is about the ORFs being out of frame, which is a separate issue.

Given that, the correct answer would be that the lox2272 isn't being cut, leading to the stop remaining. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes were in the wrong orientation, making the Cre unable to excise them. But again, the options don't address that.

Wait, another approach: the loxP and lox2272 are used to allow for the expression of the two ORFs in a Cre-dependent manner. The ligand's stop is in loxP, which is excised by Cre, allowing ligand and mCherry expression. The receptor's stop is in lox2272, which requires a different Cre (like Dre) to excise. SOX10-Cre only expresses Cre, which can't cut lox2272. Thus, the receptor and eGFP are not expressed, hence no green signal.

So the problem is that the lox2272 site can't be cut, but again, the options don't directly address this. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, the question is highlighting that the lox sites are different, leading to the stop not being excised, but this isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Wait, that would mean the ligand is secreted, so the receptor is in a different cell. But in this case, the construct would express both in the same cell, which is autocrine. If they're in a paracrine relationship, perhaps the construct is designed to express both in the same cell, but the ligand is secreted. But that doesn't explain why eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ligand and receptor are expressed in different cells, and thus the eGFP isn't expressed because the Cre isn't active in the same cells as the construct. But the SOX10-Cre should activate the construct in neural crest cells.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is likely D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. Because if the stop is correctly excised, but the ORFs are not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But if the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed at all.

But the question is why there's no eGFP. So the most likely reason is that the stop isn't excised, making the eGFP not expressed. Since the options don't mention this, the next possible is D.

Wait, perhaps the stop cassettes are in a way that when the Cre cuts, the ORFs are in frame. If they're not, then no eGFP. So the problem is that the ORFs are not in frame, so D is the answer.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent tags mCherry and eGFP, respectively. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites are used to control expression. SOX10-Cre mice are used to excise the stop cassettes in neural crest-derived cells, but no green signal (eGFP) is observed in the offspring. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design and Cre Activity**:
   - The ligand ORF is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor ORF is under the IRES element.
   - The ligand is flanked by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor is flanked by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.
   - SOX10-Cre is expected to excise the loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes, allowing expression of the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP fusion proteins.

2. **Observed Outcome**:
   - No green signal (eGFP) is observed in the offspring, indicating that the receptor-eGFP fusion is not being expressed.

3. **Critical Observations**:
   - The ligand is under a strong promoter (CBA), so it is likely expressed.
   - The absence of eGFP suggests that the stop cassette upstream of the receptor-eGFP fusion is not being excised, preventing receptor-eGFP expression.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A (Ligand and receptor in a paracrine relationship)**: This would imply the ligand acts on a different cell, but the construct is designed for co-expression in the same cell. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.
   - **Option B (Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi)**: This would prevent surface expression but not total expression. The Western blot in the question focuses on total proteins, so this is unlikely.
   - **Option C (Enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing)**: The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong and does not require enhancers. The receptor is under an IRES, so this is unlikely to be the issue.
   - **Option D (Receptor and eGFP are not in frame)**: If the stop cassette is not excised, the receptor and eGFP would not be expressed at all. This aligns with the observation of no green signal, as the stop cassette prevents translation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The most plausible explanation is that the stop cassette upstream of the receptor-eGFP fusion is not being excised, preventing receptor-eGFP expression. This aligns with **Option D**, as the absence of eGFP expression suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not being translated correctly due to a lack of excision.

Answer: D
