Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me think about what I know. So, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, the question is about finding the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

Right, LTE means that the photospheric conditions can be described by the Boltzmann equation. I remember the Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of different energy states in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of populations being equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), right?

So the Boltzmann factor is (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two energy levels, E_i and E_j, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me assume that in star_1, the excited state is higher in energy than in star_2. Wait, no, actually, wait. The energy difference is between two levels, but the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is higher in star_1.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the ratio of populations. Let's say the excited level is E, and the ground level is E0. Then, in star_1, (n_E / n_E0) = 2 times that of star_2. Or wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Oh, wait, maybe it's that the ratio of the number of atoms in a specific excited state compared to another state is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1
