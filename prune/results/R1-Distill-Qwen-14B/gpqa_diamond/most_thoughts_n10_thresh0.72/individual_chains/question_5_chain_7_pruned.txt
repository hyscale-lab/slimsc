Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvectors correspond to the eigenstates of the direction of spin.

Wait, the operator P is probably the spin operator, but I'm not entirely sure. The components P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2 give the components of the spin operator. So P is the spin operator, maybe like S?

The eigenvector we're looking for is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction is determined by an angle θ from the z-axis, right? So the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Wait, no, if it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I might have that reversed. Wait, no, typically, θ is measured from the z-axis. So for example, in a direction making an angle θ with the z-axis in the x-z plane, the components would be x = sinθ, z = cosθ.

The operator we're looking at is P · n, or maybe more accurately, the component along n. Wait, the operator for the spin along an arbitrary direction n is given by n · P, which would be P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator becomes P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which makes sense because for a spin-1/2 particle, the maximum eigenvalue is ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector of the operator (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvector should satisfy (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write down the matrices for each component. The given matrices are:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator along n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Let me compute that. Since n is in the x-z plane, n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1.

So the operator becomes:

P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0 1],[1 0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1 0],[0 -1]]

Which can be written as (ħ/2) times the matrix:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix P is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

We're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Substituting P:

(ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives the system of equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me rearrange each equation.

First equation: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
Second equation: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

So, the system is:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

For non-trivial solutions (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. But wait, since we already know that this is an eigenvalue equation, perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, we can write this as a homogeneous system and find the ratio of a to b.

From the first equation:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b
=> a = [ -n_x / (n_z -
