Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows some anomalies. Let me break down the details. The NMR's 1H spectrum is mostly as expected, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. So, that suggests that maybe the proton is split into two, but the integral together is just one, so maybe it's a doublet? Wait, but the question says they integrate to 1H together. So each peak is about 0.5H on average.

The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not like vicinal coupling where you might get a doublet or something. Hmm. So, what else could cause two peaks for the same proton without coupling? Maybe some kind of splitting due to the structure itself.

Then looking at the LC-MS analysis. The crude compound has two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, matching the expected molecule. So the mass is correct, but the LC shows two peaks. That suggests that there are two components with the same mass, but different structures—like maybe enantiomers or diastereomers, or something else.

Wait, but if they're enantiomers, their LC retention times could be the same if the column isn't chiral. Or maybe the LC is achiral. But in that case, you might see two peaks if the column can separate them. Alternatively, maybe it's a diastereomer which would have different retention times even on achiral columns.

Wait, but the question says the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass. So same molecular weight, but different structures—like isomers. So what's the possible isomer here?

The options are A to D. Let's look at them.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a precursor would have a larger mass. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as the expected. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. If the compound is a pure enantiomer, it should have a single peak on LC if the column is achiral. But if it's a racemic mixture, maybe in some cases the peaks would co-elute, but if the column is chiral, you'd see two peaks. But the problem states that the LC-MS shows two peaks, so maybe the column is chiral, so it's separating the enantiomers. But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. How does that fit?

If the compound is a racemic mixture, each enantiomer would have their own NMR spectrum. But in a racemic mix, you'd see a single peak for each proton because the environment is the same in both enantiomers, right? No, wait. For chiral centers, the alpha protons (like in amino acids) would be equivalent in each en
