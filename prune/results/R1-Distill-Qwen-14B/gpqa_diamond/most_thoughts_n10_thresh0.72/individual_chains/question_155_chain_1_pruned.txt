Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty of an observable is calculated using the expectation values. The formula I think is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I'll need to find these expectation values.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, because P_z is one of the Pauli matrices, maybe? Or perhaps it's a spin operator in the z-direction, which would have eigenstates aligned with the z-axis.

Wait, wait. The matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z are given. Let me look at them.

P_x matrix:
Row 1: 0, ħ/√2, 0
Row 2: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2
Row 3: 0, ħ/√2, 0

Hmm, but wait, I thought the Pauli matrices are 2x2, but here they're 3x3. Oh, wait no, perhaps these are not the Pauli matrices, but maybe they're for spin-1 systems. Because spin-1 has three possible states (m = -1, 0, +1), so the matrices are 3x3.

Wait, the P_z matrix is given as:
Row 1: ħ, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -ħ

So the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. Wait, that's interesting because for a spin-1 system, the z-component usually has eigenvalues mħ where m is -1, 0, +1. So yes, that makes sense
