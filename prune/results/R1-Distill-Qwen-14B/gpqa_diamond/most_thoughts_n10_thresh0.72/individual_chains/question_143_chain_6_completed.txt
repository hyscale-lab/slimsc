Okay, so I've got this question about the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that pinacol is a molecule with two adjacent alcohol groups. When it undergoes this rearrangement under acidic conditions, it forms a ketone called pinacolone.

The question has two reactions, right? Let me read them again. 

The first reaction is A + H2SO4 yielding 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. The second is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate plus H2SO4 gives B.

I need to find what A and B are. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possibilities for A and B.

So, focusing on the first reaction: starting material A reacts in acid to form a ketone. Since it's a pinacol rearrangement, A must be the pinacol structure. Pinacol has two adjacent hydroxyl groups on a carbon adjacent to another group. Wait, wait. No, pinacol has two adjacent diols, right? So the structure is something like two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, perhaps in a cyclic structure.

The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that. It's a cyclohexane ring where the 2 position has two p-tolyl groups attached, and the 1 position is a ketone. So the structure is cyclohexanone with two p-tolyl groups on C2 and a ketone on C1.

Wait, no. The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1, and two p-tolyl groups on position 2. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring where C1 is a carbonyl group (O), and C2 has two p-tolyl substituents.

So how does the pinacol rearrangement lead to this? Let me think. In the rearrangement, the pinacol (two adjacent alcohols) would lose water, form a carbocation, and then undergo a hydride shift.

Wait, the mechanism: protonation of one OH, leading to the loss of water and forming a carbocation. Then a hydride shift occurs, leading to a carbonyl group. So the original diol has two adjacent OH groups. When one is protonated, it leaves as H2O, creating a carbocation next to the other OH. Then a hydride shift happens, moving a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon to the carbocation, which forms a new carbonyl group.

So, the starting material A must have two adjacent hydroxyl groups. After rearrangement, the product is a ketone, with substituents at a particular position.

Looking at the product 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone has two p-tolyl groups on C2 and the ketone on C1.

In the pinacol structure, the two OHs would be on adjacent carbons. Let's say in the starting material, the two OHs are on C1 and C2 of a cyclohexane ring. Wait, but wait, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the original structure has adjacent diols.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material. Suppose we have a cyclohexane ring with two adjacent diols (two OH groups on adjacent carbons). When the reaction occurs, one OH is protonated, and water leaves, forming a carbocation on the adjacent carbon. Then a hydride shift occurs, moving a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon to the carbocation, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

So, if the starting material has two OHs on adjacent carbons, say C1 and C2, then after rearrangement, these would form a carbonyl on C1 and some substituents on C2.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol where the two OHs are on the same carbon? No, wait, no. Pinacol is a vicinal diol, meaning the two OHs are on adjacent carbons. So, structure is RCH(OH)CH(OH)R'.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclohexanone. So perhaps the starting material is a diol in a cyclohexanol structure.

Let me think again. The product is a six-membered ring (cyclohexanone) with two p-tolyl groups on C2 and the ketone on C1. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexanol derivative with diols on adjacent positions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,2-diol (vicinal diol) on a cyclohexane ring. So, for example, 1,2-bis(p-tolylhydroxymethyl)cyclohexane. Wait, but the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So, the cyclohexanol has two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, but wait that's not possible because cyclohexanol has a single OH. Wait, no, wait: if it's 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol, that would imply a structure where the cyclohexanol (OH on C1) is attached to a CH(OH) group that's connected to two p-tolyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diol where one carbon has two p-tolyl groups and an OH, and the adjacent carbon has another OH.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is (p-tolyl)₂C(OH)CH₂OH, but that's for a non-cyclic compound. But the product is a cyclohexanone, so the starting material must have a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon has two p-tolyl groups and another OH, and the adjacent carbon has another OH.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So, that would mean the cyclohexan-1-ol has a CH(OH) group attached to two p-tolyl groups. Wait, how?

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. The starting material A is a molecule where two adjacent carbons have OH groups. One of those carbons is attached to the cyclohexane ring and has another substituent.

Wait, perhaps A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So, the structure is a cyclohexanol (OH on C1) that is connected to a -CH(OH) group, which is then connected to two p-tolyl groups. So the diol is on the same carbon as the cyclohexane ring?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the product. The product has a ketone on C1 and two p-tolyl groups on C2. So during the rearrangement, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons, C1 and C2.

Wait, no. Let's think about the mechanism again. The pinacol rearrangement involves protonation of one OH, loss of water to form a carbocation on the adjacent carbon, followed by a hydride shift from a neighboring carbon, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group on the original position of the protonated OH.

So, if the starting material has OH groups on carbons 1 and 2, then after rearrangement, the ketone would form on carbon 1 (where the protonated OH was), and the substituents would be on carbon 2.

Wait, that would make sense. So in the product, the ketone is on C1, and the substituents (two p-tolyl groups) are on C2.

So the starting material A must have diols on C1 and C2. But wait, in the product, the ketone is at C1, and the two p-tolyl groups are on C2.

So, in A, the diol is on C1 and C2 of a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, but in the product, the substituents are on C2. So in the starting material, perhaps C2 has two p-tolyl groups and an OH, and C1 has another OH.

Wait, that would complicate the structure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diol where the two OHs are on adjacent carbons, and one of those carbons is connected to two p-tolyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexane ring with an adjacent diol, where one of the diol carbons is connected to two p-tolyl groups.

Wait, like (p-tolyl)₂C(OH)-CH₂OH attached to a cyclohexane ring? No, wait, that wouldn't be a cyclohexane ring. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is (p-tolyl)₂C(OH)CH₂OH as a diol, but that's a non-cyclic structure. Which reaction would form a cyclohexanone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic diol. Like, 1,2-bis(p-tolylhydroxymethyl)cyclohexane. That is, the cyclohexane ring has two adjacent CH(OH) groups, each attached to a p-tolyl group.

Wait, but then when the rearrangement occurs, one OH is protonated, water leaves, forming a carbocation on the adjacent carbon. Then a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon, moving towards the carbocation, leading to the formation of a ketone.

So, suppose the structure is:

Cyclohexane ring where C1 has a CH(OH) group (with two p-tolyl substituents), and C2 has another OH group. Then, upon acid treatment, the OH on C1 is protonated, becomes H2O, leaving a carbocation on C1. Then a hydride shift occurs from C2's adjacent carbon (C3) to C1, forming a carbonyl on C1. But wait, that would form a ketone on C1, and the substituents on C1 would be... Hmm, wait, no.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol where the two OHs are on a bridge or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclohexanol derivative with two adjacent OH groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexanol where the adjacent carbon (like C2) has another OH and two p-tolyl groups.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the options to see what the possible A structures are.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

So, the structure would be a cyclohexan-1-ol (OH on C1) with a CH(OH) group attached to two p-tolyl groups. So, the structure would be:

Cyclohexanol with a substituent at C1, which is a CH(OH) group connected to two p-tolyl groups. So, the diol is on C1 (cyclohexanol) and on the adjacent carbon (the CH(OH) group). Wait, but that would be a vicinal diol.

So, when acid is added, one OH is protonated, turns into water, leaving a carbocation on the adjacent carbon. Then a hydride shift occurs from the CH(OH) group? Or from another position.

Wait, so in this structure, the diol is on C1 (cyclohexanol) and on C1's substituent (the CH(OH) group). So, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons (the cyclohexanol's C1 and the substituent's C of CH(OH)).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(OH)(p-tolyl)₂ group attached to C1 of the cyclohexanol. So, the diol is between C1 (cyclohexanol) and the substituent's OH.

Wait, that may not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group with two p-tolyl groups and an OH, and the cyclohexanol has another OH on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the product.

The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ketone is on C1, and two p-tolyl groups on C2. So, the starting material must have a diol where the two OHs are on C1 and C2. But then, upon rearrangement, the OH on C1 becomes a ketone, and the substituent on C2 (which was something else) becomes two p-tolyl groups.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think in terms of the mechanism.

Original structure: C1 has OH, C2 has two p-tolyl groups and another OH? No, because the starting material is a diol, so two adjacent OHs.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (p-tolyl)₂C(OH)CH₂OH attached to a cyclohexane ring. But that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a structure where the two OHs are on a central carbon that's attached to the cyclohexane ring and to two p-tolyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (p-tolyl)₂C(OH)CH₂OH in a cyclic form. That is, the central carbon is connected to two p-tolyl groups, two OHs, and a cyclohexane ring. But that would make the central carbon have four substituents, which isn't possible.

Wait, no, perhaps the starting material is a diol where one of the OHs is on the cyclohexane ring's adjacent carbon to another carbon that has two p-tolyl groups and another OH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: the cyclohexane ring has a CH₂ group attached to a carbon that has two p-tolyl groups and another OH. And the adjacent carbon (on the ring) has an OH.

So, the structure would be like cyclohexane with a CH₂-CH(OH)(p-tolyl)₂ group. Then, the adjacent ring carbon has an OH.

So, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons.

When the acid is added, one OH (say, the one on the CH₂) is protonated, then deprotonated as water, leaving a carbocation on that carbon. Then the hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon (which has the two p-tolyl groups and the OH) to the carbocation.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the hydride shift is from the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

So, the cyclohexan-1-ol has a methyl group attached to C1, which in turn is connected to a hydroxyl group and two p-tolyl groups. So, the structure is:

Cyclohexanol (OH on C1) with a substituent: CH(OH)(p-tolyl)₂ attached to C1.

So, the diol is on the same carbon (C1) with the cyclohexanol's OH and the CH(OH) substituent. But wait, that would make it a diol on the same carbon, not adjacent.

No, wait, the substituent is a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)₂ group attached to C1, which is the same carbon as the cyclohexanol's OH. So, that would make the diol on the same carbon, not adjacent. Hmm, that can't be right because pinacol needs adjacent diols.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the substituent is a CH₂ group attached to C1, which has an OH and two p-tolyl groups. So, the structure is more like:

Cyclohexane with a CH₂ group at C1, which is connected to a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)₂ group. So, the diol would be on the CH₂ and the CH(OH). So, the two OHs are on adjacent carbons (the CH₂ and the CH(OH)).

Wait, that would make sense. So, the starting material A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. So, the structure is cyclohexan-1-ol (OH on C1) with a substituent on C1 which is a CH₂ group connected to a CH(OH)(p-tolyl)₂ group. So, the diol is on the CH₂ and the CH(OH).

So, when acid is added, one OH (say, on the CH₂) is protonated. The water leaves, forming a carbocation on the CH₂. Then a hydride shift occurs from the adjacent CH(OH) group to the carbocation, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group on the original CH₂ position. The two p-tolyl groups would end up on the adjacent carbon (where the hydride came from), which is now connected to the carbonyl.

So, the product would have a ketone on the original CH₂ position (now C1 of the cyclohexanone), and the two p-tolyl groups on the adjacent carbon (which was the CH(OH) group, now becomes C2).

That makes sense. So the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, which matches the first reaction.

Now, looking at the options, which option for A matches this structure?

Option A says A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. Yes, that's exactly what we were thinking. So option A or D.

Wait, the options for A are:

Option A: A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

Option B: A is cyclopentan-1-ol.

Option C: same as B.

Option D: A is cyclohexan-1-ol.

So, if the starting material is a cyclohexane ring with substituents as discussed, then option A or D is correct for the first part.

Wait, looking again: in the product, it's cyclohexanone, so the starting material should have a cyclohexane ring. So, options A and D are possible.

Now, moving to the second reaction: methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 → B.

I need to find what B is. The starting material here is a methyl ester of a dihydroxybutanoate. The structure is: OMe-O-C-O- with substituents at positions 2 and 3, where position 2 has a p-tolyl group and hydroxyl groups at 2 and 3.

Wait, the structure is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate, which would be:

The butanoate ester: CH₂(COOCH3)CH(OH)CH₂OH? Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, butanoate is four carbons, with the carboxylic acid at the end. So, structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-OH?

No, wait, let me write it correctly. The butanoate is CH₂CH₂CH₂COOCH3, but with substituents.

Wait, the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-OH? No, because the numbering is 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl).

So, the structure is:

COOCH3 is at position 4 (the end), then position 3 is CH₂, position 2 is CH(OH)(p-tolyl), and position 1 is CH₂OH.

Wait, no. The formula is CH₂(OH)-C(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

Butanoate ester: the four carbons are:

1: CH₂OH

2: CH(OH)(p-tolyl)

3: CH₂

4: COOCH3

So, the structure is: CH₂(OH)CH(OH)(p-tolyl)CH₂COOCH3.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain with hydroxyl groups on C2 and C3, and a p-tolyl group on C2.

Wait, but in the Pinacol rearrangement, the diol must be vicinal (adjacent). In this structure, the hydroxyl groups are on C2 and C3, adjacent carbons. So, this is a vicinal diol.

So, under acidic conditions, the Pinacol rearrangement would occur.

The mechanism: protonation of one OH, loss of water, formation of a carbocation on the adjacent carbon, then a hydride shift to form a ketone.

So, the starting material is a diol with a p-tolyl group on C2.

In the product B, what would form?

The starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

After acid treatment, the reaction would proceed as follows:

Protonation of one of the OH groups (say, on C2), loss of water, forming a carbocation on C3. Then, a hydride shift occurs from C4 (the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbocation) to form a carbonyl group on C3.

Wait, but wait. The starting material has C2 and C3 as diols. So, the carbocation would be on C3 after the loss of water from C2.

Wait, perhaps the hydride shift is from C2 to C3? No, because after losing the water, the carbocation is on C3. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C4.

So, the hydride can come from C2 (which has a p-tolyl group) or from C4 (a CH₂ group).

If a hydride shifts from C2 to C3, what would happen?

Wait, but C2 has a hydroxyl group and a p-tolyl group. So, when the carbocation is on C3, the possible hydride sources are from C2 (if it's a CH group) or C4 (CH₂ group).

Wait, the structure is CH₂(OH)CH(OH)(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH3.

Wait, upon protonation of, say, the C2 OH, it becomes H2O and leaves, forming a carbocation on C3.

Now, the C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH(OH)(p-tolyl)), and C4 (CH₂COOCH3). So, the carbocation is on C3.

Possible hydride shifts: from C2 or C4.

If a hydride shifts from C2 to C3: then the structure would form a double bond between C2 and C3, but wait, that's not a carbonyl.

Wait, no. Alternatively, if a hydride shifts from C4 to C3, that would form a carbonyl on C3.

Wait, the carbocation is on C3. Let's imagine the structure:

CH₂(OH) - C(OH)(p-tolyl) - CH₂ - COOCH3.

After losing an OH from C2 (protonated, then becomes H2O), the carbocation is on C3. So, the structure is:

CH₂(OH) - C(OH)(p-tolyl) - [CH₂+]- COOCH3.

Wait, no, the carbocation is on C3, which is a CH₂ group. So, the structure is:

CH₂(OH) - C(OH)(p-tolyl) - [CH₂+]-COOCH3.

Wait, but that would require the carbocation to be on a CH₂ group. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is:

CH₂(OH) - CH(OH)(p-tolyl) - CH₂ - COOCH3.

Upon protonation of the C2 OH, it becomes H2O, leaving a carbocation on C3 (which is CH₂+).

Now, the C3 is CH₂+, adjacent to C2 (which is CH(OH)(p-tolyl)) and C4 (CH₂COOCH3).

Possible hydride shifts: from C2 or C4.

If a hydride comes from C2, which is connected to a CH group (since it's CH(OH)(p-tolyl)), perhaps it can donate a hydrogen.

Wait, but C2 is CH(OH)(p-tolyl). If it donates a hydrogen, moving from C2 to C3, that would form a double bond between C2 and C3, but that would produce an alkene, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps a hydride from C4 (which is CH₂) can shift to C3.

So, the CH₂ group (C4) donates a hydrogen to C3's carbocation. That would form a carbonyl group on C3.

So, the product would have a ketone at C3.

So, the structure becomes:

CH₂(OH) - CH(OH)(p-tolyl) - CO - COOCH3? Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, wait, when a hydride shifts from C4 to C3, the carbocation on C3 captures a hydride from C4's CH₂ group, turning it into a CH group. Then, the carbocation would be at C3, but after the shift, it would form a double bond? Or a carbonyl.

Wait, no. The shift would be a hydride (H-) moving from C4 to C3, resulting in the formation of a carbonyl group on C3.

So, the structure would be:

CH₂(OH) - CH(OH)(p-tolyl) - C(O) - COOCH3.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, with a ketone on C3. So, the product would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Wait, because the carbonyl is on C3, which is the same as the original C3.

Wait, the starting material is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

After the rearrangement, the product would have a carbonyl group on C3. So, the structure would be methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

So, product B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Looking at the options, which option has B as this structure?

Option A: B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Option B: same as A.

Option C: B is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate.

Option D: same as C.

So, in this case, product B is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A is cyclohexan-1-ol derivative, B is correct.

Option B: A is cyclopentan-1-ol, which would have a five-membered ring. But the product is a six-membered ring, so option B and C are incorrect for the first part.

So, the correct option for the first reaction is when A is a cyclohexane derivative, which is options A or D.

Wait, but looking at option D, B is methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate, which doesn't match our product. So, option A and B have B as the correct structure.

So, for the first reaction, options A and B have the correct structure for B.

But wait, the first reaction's product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the starting material A must have a cyclohexane ring, so options A and D are possible for part A.

In option A, A is a cyclohexan-1-ol derivative, and B is correct. So, A would be correct.

In option D, A is a cyclohexan-1-ol derivative, but B is incorrect.

So, option A is correct for both.

Wait, but looking back, in the first problem, the product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, which requires the starting material A to have diols on adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of the ketone on one and substituents on the other.

So, the starting material A is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol.

Which is option A and D for A. But option D's B is incorrect.

So, the correct option is option A.


The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement involves the conversion of a vicinal diol into a ketone under acidic conditions. The reaction proceeds via protonation of one hydroxyl group, loss of water to form a carbocation, and a 1,2-hydride shift, leading to the formation of a ketone.

### Reaction 1:  
**A + H₂SO₄ → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one**  
The product, 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, is a cyclohexanone with a ketone at position 1 and two p-tolyl groups at position 2. For this product to form, the starting material must be a vicinal diol with two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons. The structure of **A** is 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol. This molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxyl group on C1 and a CH(OH) group attached to two p-tolyl groups. Under acidic conditions, one hydroxyl group is protonated, water is lost, forming a carbocation on C1. A hydride shift occurs from the adjacent carbon (C2), leading to the formation of a ketone on C1 and leaving the two p-tolyl groups on C2.

### Reaction 2:  
**methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H₂SO₄ → B**  
The starting material is a methyl ester of a dihydroxybutanoate with hydroxyl groups on C2 and C3, and a p-tolyl group on C2. Under acidic conditions, one hydroxyl group is protonated, water is lost, forming a carbocation on C3. A hydride shift occurs from C4 (a CH₂ group), leading to the formation of a ketone on C3. The product is methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate.

### Analysis of Options:  
- **Option A:**  
  - A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol (correct for Reaction 1).  
  - B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate (correct for Reaction 2).  

- **Option B:**  
  - A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol (incorrect, as the product is a cyclohexanone, not a cyclopentanone).  
  - B = methyl 3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate (correct for Reaction 2).  

- **Option C:**  
  - A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclopentan-1-ol (incorrect, as the product is a cyclohexanone, not a cyclopentanone).  
  - B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate (incorrect, as the product is a butanoate, not a propanoate).  

- **Option D:**  
  - A = 1-(hydroxydi-p-tolylmethyl)cyclohexan-1-ol (correct for Reaction 1).  
  - B = methyl 2-methyl-3-oxo-2-(p-tolyl)propanoate (incorrect, as the product is a butanoate, not a propanoate).  

### Conclusion:  
The correct option is **A**, as it provides the correct starting material and product for both reactions.  

**Answer: A**
