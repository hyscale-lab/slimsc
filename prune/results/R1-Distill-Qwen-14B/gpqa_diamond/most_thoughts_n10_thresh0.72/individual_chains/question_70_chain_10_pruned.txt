Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the problem gives a series of reactions and asks about the molecular symmetry of product E. The options are various symmetry groups, so I need to figure out what E is first.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. I'm trying to think of a bright red product. Maybe something like sulfur? Or perhaps a metal oxide? Wait, another thought: maybe it's about transition metals. For example, copper compounds can be red. Or maybe iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 8 equivalents of gas B. So, the ratio of A to B is 1:8. That's a lot. Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen? Like, 8 equivalents would imply something like 8 moles of B per mole of A. If A is, say, copper, and B is chlorine gas (Cl2), then 8 equivalents of Cl2 would make sense for a reaction like Cu reacting with Cl2 to form CuCl2. But wait, copper reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio usually, but maybe under certain conditions?

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a +3 ion. If B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl per mole of A. So, if A is aluminum, then AlCl3 would be the product. But aluminum is a solid, and AlCl3 is a gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Wait, the product C is bright red. Hmm, could it be something like mercury(II,II) chloride, which is red? Or perhaps a different compound. Another possibility is that C is a transition metal complex, maybe something with a d^6 configuration that has a bright red color. Or perhaps it's a nitrate, like sodium nitrate is white, but maybe not.

Alternatively, another approach: let's think of reaction sequences. The first reaction is A + 8 B → C (bright red). Then, C reacts with 2 D → E (extremely hazardous). Then, C reacts with
