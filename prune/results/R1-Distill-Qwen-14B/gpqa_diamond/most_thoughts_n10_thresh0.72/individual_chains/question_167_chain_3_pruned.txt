Okay, I've got this physics problem about calculating non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, I remember that non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are those that can be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent states or thermal states. Non-Gaussian states can't be described that way, so their density matrices have non-Gaussian properties, like higher-order moments that don't fit a Gaussian distribution.

The problem asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) using relative entropy. The formula given is delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state, and rho is the non-Gaussian state's density matrix.

But wait, relative entropy is usually S(rho || tau) = trace(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). Oh wait, the formula given here is delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Oh, that's actually the negative of the relative entropy between rho and tau. Because S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Hmm, but the problem says tau is the reference Gaussian. So maybe delta_b is that difference.

But regardless, I think the idea is that the non-Gaussianity is calculated based on how different rho is from a Gaussian state tau. However, for some specific states, like maybe when the state is Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

Wait, let's look at the state given. It's a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian states. So when you take a superposition, the state becomes non-Gaussian only if the superposition doesn't result in a Gaussian state.

But wait, the state here is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Let's compute N first. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²
