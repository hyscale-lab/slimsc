Okay, so I've got this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The reaction is gamma gamma → e+ e-.

The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays their lifetimes in the universe would be limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, so it's a high-energy physics problem.

I think this has to do with the concept of photon-photon interactions and the mean free path of gamma-rays. Gamma-rays with high enough energy would interact with the CMB photons, causing them to annihilate. The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before interacting. If the mean free path is small, the gamma-rays can't travel far because they annihilate quickly, so their lifetime (or how far they can go) is limited by this process.

So, how do I find the energy where the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this annihilation process?

I remember that the cross-section (σ) for the γγ → e+ e- reaction is important. The cross-section depends on the energy of the gamma-rays. At high energies, the cross-section increases as energy increases. The process is more probable at higher energies.

The general approach might involve calculating the optical depth (τ), which is the product of the number of target photons (n) and the cross-section (σ). The optical depth tells us the probability that a gamma-ray will annihilate after traveling a certain distance. If τ becomes of order 1, that's when the process starts to significantly affect the gamma-ray's journey.

The mean free path (λ) is the inverse of the product of cross-section and photon density: λ = 1/(nσ). The lifetime of the gamma-ray is limited when the optical depth is around 1, so when τ ≈ 1, the mean free path is about the same as the distance the photon can travel before annihilating.

So, I need to model τ for the CMB. The CMB photon density is based on the CMB temperature. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, which is about 0.001 eV. I think the CMB has a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of about 2.7 K. The energy of a blackbody photon is related to temperature by E = k*T, where k is Boltmann's constant. Let me compute that: E ~ (8.617e-5 eV/K) * 2.7 K ≈ 2.3e-4 eV. But the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, which is higher. Maybe it's the peak energy or an approximation.

Wait, but perhaps the exact energy isn't crucial here because the cross-section formula might account for it. I think the cross-section for γγ → e+e- at high energies (when the center-of-mass energy is much larger than the electron mass) can be approximated using the formula derived from the photon-photon collision cross-section.

I recall that the cross-section σ for two photons with energies ε1 and ε2 is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / (s)) * (m_e^2), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, s = (ε1 + ε2)^2 (since for massless particles, s = (ε1 + ε2)^2). Alternatively, at high energies, when ε1 ≫ m_e c² and ε2 ≫ m_e c², the cross-section can be approximated as σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / (4 ε̄^2)), where ε̄ is the typical photon energy. Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The photon-photon cross-section for pair production can be expressed as σ ≈ (σ_T * α) / (4 π ε_cm^2), where ε_cm is the center-of-mass energy. Alternatively, I might be mixing some terms here.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the cross-section for two photons with energy ε and ε' is σ = (8π/3) * (α²)/( (ε ε') ) ) * (1/(16 π²)) ) ... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, using the approximation for the cross-section when both photons are high energy, so ε, ε' >> m_e c².

The cross-section for γγ → e+e- is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2) / (4 ε^2), where ε is the energy of each photon in the center-of-mass frame? Or perhaps each photon's energy in the lab frame. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively,
