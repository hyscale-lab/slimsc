Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons. 

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes. So if both bromides are eliminated, we might get some kind of diene or maybe a bridged diene.

The product is a light yellow solid. Looking at the IR spectrum, there's a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That peak is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), so maybe the product is an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides don't have carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. But wait, where would that ketone come from? Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: when two vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalide) are treated with a base, they can undergo an elimination to form an alkene. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So elimination might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann condensation? No, that's for cyclic esters from esters. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the KOH is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but for each Br, but since they're on 1 and 3, perhaps two eliminations happen to form a conjugated diene. But then, where would the carbonyl come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts pro
