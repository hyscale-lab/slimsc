Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The problem is about the decay of a particle in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X^0 decays into Y+ and Z-. The proper lifetime of X^0 is given as tau_0 = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed in the chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when a particle decays, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame depends on its speed. Since particles moving at relativistic speeds will have their lifetimes dilated due to time dilation from special relativity. So the lifetime in the lab frame (tau) is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau_0).

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is gamma = E/(m c^2). Oh wait, since we're dealing with units where c is 1 (like in particle physics), then gamma is just E/m. But wait, E here is the total energy of the particle, right.

So the energy of X^0 is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41*8 is 27.28. Oh wait, 3.41 * 7.9 is 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.917. So gamma is around 7.917.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. So tau = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.917 * 8 = 63.336. So tau is approximately 63.336e-16 seconds, which is 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but why do we need
