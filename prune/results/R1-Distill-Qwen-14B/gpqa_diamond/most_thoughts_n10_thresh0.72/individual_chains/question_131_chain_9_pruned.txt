Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read through it again and break it down step by step.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. That acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. So dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride, which makes sense. Now, the anhydride has some specific NMR characteristics. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Wait, 7 ppm is usually in the aromatic region. So maybe the anhydride has some aromatic protons? But wait, anhydrides can sometimes form rings, like cyclic anhydrides. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclopentanone or something else.

Looking at the 13C NMR, there are two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon, like a ketone or an ester. The 137 ppm is probably a carbon attached to double bonds or maybe an aromatic carbon. Hmm, but wait, if the diacid had a cis-alkene, when it dehydrates, it would form an anhydride with a double bond? Or perhaps form a ring.

Wait, when a diacid with a cis-alkene is heated, it can form a cyclic anhydride. For example, if the acid has two COOH groups and a double bond between two adjacent carbons. So when dehydrated, it forms a five-membered ring, like a succinic anhydride, but with a double bond.

Wait, but the 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that all the protons in that region are equivalent. Maybe it's a substituted benzene? Or perhaps it's a conjugated system where the protons are in a symmetrical environment. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has a bridged structure or some symmetry.

Wait, another thought: if the diacid is something like maleic acid (which is a cis-diacid), when it forms an anhydride, it's maleic anhydride,
