Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right?

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the different phosphate species. Let me think. H3PO4 is triprotic, so it can donate three protons. The first dissociation gives H2PO4^- (that's dihydrogen phosphate), the second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-.

But the question is about orthophosphate ions. So I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.

The solution has 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me figure out the molar amounts first.

Let me calculate the moles of each. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

So for KH2PO4: moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol. Let me double-check that division. 136.09 multiplied by 0.00734... Wait, 136.09 * 0.00734. Hmm, 136 * 0.007 is 0.952, 0.00734 is a bit more. So approx 0.00734 mol.

Wait, actually, let me compute it more accurately. 1.00 / 136.09. Let me use a calculator in my mind. 136.09 is roughly 136.1. 1/136.1 ≈ 0.00734. Yes, so 0.00734 moles of KH2PO4.

Now, Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol. Let me compute that: 178 is about 178, so 1/178 ≈ 0.005618. So about 0.005618 mol.

Now, considering the salts. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So from KH2PO4, we get 0.00734 mol of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: when it dissociates, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water, but the water is part of the structure, so the main ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-. So from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, we get 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but what about the solution? The solution will have these ions. But phosphate can exist in different forms depending on pH.

Wait, but H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can interconvert. The question is about PO4^3- concentration. So I need to calculate how much of each species is present, considering the dissociation constants.

Wait, but the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So we have a buffer solution here, perhaps?

Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2
