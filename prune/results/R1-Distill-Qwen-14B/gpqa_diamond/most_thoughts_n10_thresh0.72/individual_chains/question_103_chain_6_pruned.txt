Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a different order of reactions. Hmm, let me think this through.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, and position 5 has a nitro group. Additionally, the ethanone part means there's a ketone group attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene ring has three substituents: Br at position 3, nitro at position 5, and a ketone (probably from an acetyl group) at position 1.

Wait, let me visualize the benzene ring. Positions are numbered such that the substituents are in the correct order. So, if the ketone is at position 1, then the nitro is at position 3 relative to it? No, wait. Wait, the numbering may be such that the substituents are in positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. Because when the ketone is attached to the benzene, it's like a phenyl ketone. Let me imagine: the ketone is at position 1, then the substituents on the ring are at 3 and 5. So, the substituents are at meta positions relative to each other but in specific positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the benzene ring as having three substituents: a Br, a nitro group, and an acetyl group (from the ethanone). The positions are 3-bromo, 5-nitro, and 1-acetyl, so the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5, but wait, that would make them all meta to each other? Or perhaps 1 and 3 are adjacent, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should sketch the structure. But without drawing, I'll just think. The target molecule has a benzene
