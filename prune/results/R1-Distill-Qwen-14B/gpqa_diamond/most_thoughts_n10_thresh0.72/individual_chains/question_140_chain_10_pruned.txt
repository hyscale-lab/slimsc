Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a chemical reaction involving substance X and liquid Y. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Hmm, that makes me think about light gases. Wait, because if the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, maybe it's something like H2O? No, wait, no. Because H2O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in H2O, but wait, each hydrogen is H, which has 1 proton and 0 neutrons). So the total would be H2O: 2 H's (each has 1p, 0n) and one O (8p, 8n). So total protons would be 2 +8=10, neutrons would be 0 +8=8. That's not equal. So maybe not H2O.

Wait, what about NH3? No, because N has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So NH3 has 14 protons and 0 neutrons from H and maybe N has 7 neutrons? Wait, nitrogen's atomic number is 7, so its isotope would have 7 protons and variable neutrons. Wait, but the molecule as a whole needs equal protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe it's CO2? Let's see: C is 6 protons, O is 8 each. So CO2 has 12 protons, but for neutrons: C is 6, O has 8 each. So 6 + 8*2 = 22 neutrons. 12 protons vs 22 neutrons—nope. Not equal.

Wait another thought: maybe the gas is CH4? Let's see: C has 6, each H 1. So 6 + 4 =10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, each H 0. So 6 neutrons. 10 vs 6—nope. Doesn't fit.

Wait, how about O2? O2 has each O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each O has 8 p and 8 n.
