Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The question gives me five stars with various properties, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments based on their magnitudes.

Let me start by understanding the key points. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question mentions that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star must be brighter than 17 mag to be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, but waitâ€”wait, no. Wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO" and "brighter than 16 mag for HIRES." Oh, but wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So, for example, a star with V=5 is brighter than a star with V=10.

So, for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than both 17 (so V < 17) and 16 (so V <16) mag? Wait, no, wait. No, because if ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, that means V <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16. So, to be observed by both, the star's V magnitude must be less than 16. Because if a star has V=16, HIRES can observe it (as it's brighter than 16 mag), but ESPRESSO's limit is brighter than 17, which would include 16 as acceptable. So stars with V <16 can be detected by both. Wait, no.
