Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says that there are two electrons in p orbitals. Ignoring their spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are each 1, since they're in p orbitals. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron. We're supposed to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. 

Hmm, wait. Oh, right, because Lz for each particle has eigenvalues mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So, for each electron, Lz could be -ħ, 0, or +ħ if l=1.

But wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So, the individual m1 and m2 values must add up to m = -1. Because m is the total z-component, m = m1 + m2.

Wait, but in the problem, we're ignoring spin angular momentum, so we're only considering the orbital angular momentum here. So, each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1, as given.

Now, the state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> which is |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are 1 each. The total orbital angular momentum l is 2, and the m (the z-component) is -1.

Now, when we make a measurement of L1z and L2z, the question is: what's the probability that both are -ħ. That is, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because L1z |m1> = ħ m1 |m1>, so eigenvalue is m1 ħ. So for each to be -ħ, m1 and m2 must each be -1.

Wait, but m = m1 + m2. In our state, m is -1. So if m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, then m1 + m2 = -2, which doesn't match the state's m of -1
