Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. I think this equation is about the total being even or odd based on those quantum numbers.

The final NN state has T=0. So let's see, substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That would mean S + L +1 must be even, because mod 2, 0 is even. So S + L +1 equals 0 mod 2. Which implies S + L must be 1 mod 2 (since 1 mod 2 is 1). So S + L is odd, meaning they have opposite parity in their sum.

Wait, the initial state is a 1S0 state. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0: the spin S is 0, since (2*0+1)=1. So 1S0 must have S=0, L is the orbital angular momentum. The J is the total angular momentum, which for 1S0 is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

So the initial state has T=0 (because the problem says the final state has T=0, but wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial state is given as 1S0. But the question is about the final state after emitting particle X. The problem says Pauli statistics require that for the final state, T = S + L +1 mod 2. Oh wait, no, in the question, it's the final NN state's T, S, and L that must satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2. And the final NN state has T=0. So let me re-express this.

Given T_final =
