Okay, so I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for this di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Wait, that's a bit confusing. A benzene ring has 6 carbons. So if it's di-substituted, meaning two substituents, then the total number of carbons would be 6 (from the ring) plus the substituents.

But the question says 8 carbon atoms in total. So 6 from the ring, and 2 from the substituents. Hmm, wait, no. Because each substituent can have multiple carbons. So 8 total: 6 in ring, so substituents sum to 2. So each substituent must have 1 carbon each. Because two substituents, so 2 carbons total. But wait, that might not be right. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, 6-membered aromatic ring is benzene. So benzene is six carbons. If it's di-substituted, that's two groups attached to the ring. Each of these groups can contribute more carbons. So the total is 6 + substituent carbons = 8. So substituent carbons sum to 2. So each substituent must have one carbon each, except for if one substituent has two and the other none—that can't be because it's di-substituted.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a methyl group (1 C) and the other is a carbonyl group, like a ketone. Or maybe one substituent has two carbons, like an ethyl group, but that would make substituent carbons sum to 3 (if the other is one C). Wait, but 6 + substituents =8, substituents sum to 2. So each substituent must have one carbon only.

Wait, but substituents can be more complicated. For example, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, O=C-R) and the other is a halogen. Because the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) peak and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Cl, Br attached to the ring).

Wait, let's think about the FTIR peaks. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) suggests a ketone, aldehyde, or perhaps an ester. But since it's an aromatic compound, maybe a para-substituted ketone? Also, the aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-Cl, Ar-Br) means one substituent is a halogen.

So the compound is a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group and a halogen as substituents.

Wait, but can a benzene ring have both a carbonyl group and a halogen as substituents? Yes, for example, like 4-bromobenzophenone or something similar, but wait, benzophenone has two ketone groups attached. Hmm, maybe it's a mono-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group and another substituent, but the question says di-substituted. So two substituents on the ring: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but the carbonyl group as a substituent would be a ketone, meaning the substituent is a carbonyl attached to the ring. But wait, a ketone is Ar-C=O, which would be a substituent with a carbonyl. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, that would be Ar-CHO, but that's less likely because aldehydes are more reactive and would require the substituent to be in the para position for stability.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl. So the substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone (Ar-COR), an aldehyde (Ar-CHO), an ester (Ar-O-CO-O-R?), wait no, because that would have more carbons.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Benzene (6 C) plus substituents. So if each substituent is one carbon, let's see.

If one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, which is one atom but not a carbon), wait, wait!! Oh wait, the substituents could include a non-carbon atom as part of the substituent. For example, a halogen like Cl is a substituent but doesn't add any carbons. So perhaps one substituent is a Cl, and the other is a carbonyl group, like a ketone (Ar-C=O-R?), but that would add more carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituents are Cl and a methyl ketone group. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The molecular structure: benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone), which would be a -C=O group. But in that case, the substituent is just a carbonyl, but that would be like a carbonyl group attached to the ring, which would be a benzene ring with a ketone substituent.

Wait, but a ketone substituent would be Ar-C(=O)-R, but if R is H, it's an aldehyde. So perhaps one substituent is a -Cl (adding 0 carbons) and the other is a -COCH3 group, which would add 2 carbons (CO is O, but the CH3 is 1 carbon). So the substituents would be Cl and COCH3. Then the total carbons are 6 (benzene) + 2 (from COCH3) = 8. That fits the question.

So the structure would be something like para-chlorobenzaldehyde? Wait, no, because if the substituents are Cl and COCH3, that's two substituents on the benzene ring. So it would be a di-substituted benzene with Cl and a ketone group (COCH3).

Wait, but would that give FTIR peaks for both carbonyl and aromatic-halogen? Yes, because Cl is a good IR absorber for the C-Cl bond, and the ketone has a strong C=O peak.

So the structure is benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups attached. Now, considering the substitution pattern. For a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in para, ortho, or meta positions.

Now, looking at the NMR options. Let's think about the possible structures.

If the substituents are Cl and COCH3, then the ring's protons would be in certain regions. If they are para, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, perhaps.

Wait, but if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two equivalent protons in the ortho positions, and the other two in the meta. No, wait, no, with two substituents, the ring would have equivalent protons based on symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons: the ones adjacent to both substituents (the ortho positions) and the ones opposite (the para position). Wait, but in a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, the ring would have two equivalent H's in each of the ortho positions, and the other two in the meta positions? Hmm, perhaps I need to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions. Then the ring would have two sets of protons: those ortho to both substituents (but wait, no, each substituent is in the para position relative to each other, so each substituent has two ortho Hs. But if the substituents are para, then each substituent's ortho Hs are equivalent to the other substituent's ortho Hs.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the substitution pattern and the resulting NMR signals.

If substituents are para, the ring would have two equivalent protons adjacent (ortho) to each substituent. So for each substituent, two ortho Hs. But because the substituents are para, these ortho Hs are equivalent across the ring. Similarly, the meta positions would have equivalent Hs. So for para substitution, the ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs: the ortho and the meta.

Wait, but in our case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. Are they para to each other? Let's assume that for the sake of symmetry. So the ring would have two sets of Hs: the ortho Hs to each substituent (which are equivalent), and the meta Hs (equivalent as well). But wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the ring's Hs would split into two sets. For example, in para substitution, each substituent has two ortho Hs, which are equivalent due to the symmetry. Then, the remaining two Hs are in the meta positions, which are also equivalent. So the ring would show two doublets, perhaps.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The substituents being para would create a situation where the molecule has a certain symmetry. The two substituents are opposite each other, so the Hs adjacent to substituents would be each other's mirror images. So, for each substituent, the two ortho Hs would be equivalent across the ring. So, in the NMR, the ring would show two distinct environments: the Hs ortho to substituents and the Hs meta to substituents.

Wait, but what are the substituent's electronic effects? Cl is electron-withdrawing, and COCH3 is also an electron-withdrawing group (since ketones are deactivating). But that affects the chemical shifts of the ring Hs. Ortho and para Hs are usually deshielded and appear downfield. But in the case where substituents are para, how does that affect the ring Hs?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are meta. No, the question doesn't specify, but the FTIR data includes both a carbonyl and a halogen, so the substituents are Cl and a ketone group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are not in the para position but in the meta or ortho. But without that information, maybe I should look for other clues in the NMR options.

Looking at the options, each option has a different set of NMR signals. Let's analyze each.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).

So a singlet at 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or aldehyde. If it's an aldehyde, the proton would be around δ 9-10, as a singlet. But the substituent in this case would be a Cl and a CHO group. So then the structure would be something like para-chlorobenzaldehyde. Let me think about the NMR.

In para-chlorobenzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is a singlet around 9.8-10 ppm. Then, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets: the two Hs ortho to Cl and the two Hs meta to Cl. But wait, in benzaldehyde, the aldehyde is attached, and when Cl is para to it, then the ring would have two sets of Hs: the ortho to aldehyde and Cl, and the meta. Hmm, wait no, in para substitution, each substituent is across from each other. So if the aldehyde is in position 1, Cl is in position 4. Then the ortho positions to aldehyde (positions 2 and 6) are each next to Cl (position 4 is across). Wait, no, position 4 is across from 1. So positions 2 and 6 are ortho to 1 (aldehyde), which are adjacent to Cl in position 4? No, position 4 is directly opposite. So, position 2 is adjacent to 1 (aldehyde) and position 3. Cl is in position 4, which is adjacent to positions 3 and 5. So, positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the aldehyde, and positions 3 and 5 would be ortho to Cl.

So each substituent (aldehyde and Cl) has two ortho Hs. Since the substituents are para, these ortho Hs would be equivalent. So in the aromatic region, we might see two doublets: one for the Hs ortho to aldehyde (which are also ortho to Cl since substituents are para), and another for the Hs meta to both substituents.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In para-substituted benzene with two different groups, each substituent has two ortho Hs. Because the substituents are para, those ortho Hs are equivalent across the ring. So if aldehyde is at position 1, Cl at position 4, then the Hs at positions 2 and 6 are ortho to aldehyde. Similarly, the Hs at positions 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl. But wait, position 3 is adjacent to position 4 (Cl), so it's meta to aldehyde. Hmm, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring Hs are in two different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring Hs would appear as two doublets. For example, in para substitution, the two ortho Hs to each substituent are equivalent, and the other two Hs are also equivalent. So in the NMR, the aromatic region would show two doublets: one integrating for 2H (each substituent's ortho Hs) and another for 2H (the meta Hs).

Wait, but in the case of para-chlorobenzaldehyde, the substituents are aldehyde (position 1) and Cl (position 4). The Hs at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to aldehyde) would be each adjacent to Cl (position 4), which is meta to them. So their chemical shift would be influenced by Cl. Similarly, Hs at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to aldehyde.

In such a case, the two sets of Hs (ortho to substituents) may have different chemical shifts because the substituents are different (aldehyde and Cl). So the Hs ortho to aldehyde would be more deshielded (downfield) than those ortho to Cl, because aldehydes are strong deactivating groups, while Cl is also deactivating but perhaps less so than the aldehyde.

Wait, but Cl is ortho/para directing, and aldehyde is meta directing. But that's about substitution patterns, not about chemical shifts in the NMR.

In any case, the NMR of para-chlorobenzaldehyde would have:

- One singlet for the aldehyde proton (~10 ppm)
- Two doublets for the aromatic Hs: one for those ortho to aldehyde (which may appear as a doublet due to coupling with adjacent H), and another for the Hs meta to aldehyde (which are ortho to Cl).

Wait, but looking at option A:

9.9 (1H, s) → aldehyde proton.

7.8 (2H, d) → maybe the Hs ortho to aldehyde (more deshielded, hence higher ppm)
7.6 (2H, d) → Hs ortho to Cl (less deshielded, lower ppm)
3.7 (2H, s) → maybe a CH2 group, but where?

Wait, the compound in the question has 8 carbons in total. Benzene (6 C) + substituents. If substituents are Cl (0 C) and COCH3 (2 C), then the substituent groups would add 2 C. So the structure would have a Cl and a COCH3 group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the aldehyde would be substituent with 1 C (CHO). So perhaps I'm mistaken earlier. Let me think again.

If the substituents are Cl and COCH3, then the carbonyl is present. So the structure would be something like para-chlorobenzoyl methyl? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's para-chlorophenylacetone. No, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a Cl and a ketone group (like O=C-CH3 attached to the ring).

Wait, the substituent would be an acetyl group, -COCH3. So the structure is para-chloroacetophenone. So the substituents are Cl (in position 4) and COCH3 (in position 1). Then, the molecule has 6 (ring) + 2 (COCH3) = 8 carbons.

In such a structure, the aromatic protons would be in two sets. The Hs ortho to Cl and COCH3 (positions 2,6 and 3,5, respectively) would be deshielded and appear as doublets. The H in position 4 is Cl, and position 1 is COCH3.

Wait, but in para substitution, Cl is in position 4, COCH3 in position 1. The Hs adjacent to COCH3 (position 2 and 6) are ortho to COCH3 and meta to Cl. The Hs adjacent to Cl (position 3 and 5) are ortho to Cl and meta to COCH3.

So in the NMR, the aromatic Hs would split into two sets: those ortho to COCH3 and those ortho to Cl. Each set would be a doublet because each H is adjacent to one H (coupling).

So the aromatic region would have two doublets: higher ppm for the Hs ortho to COCH3 (since ketone is electron-withdrawing, causing more deshielding) and lower ppm for the Hs ortho to Cl.

Wait, but in para substitution, the Hs ortho to COCH3 (positions 2 and 6) are actually meta to Cl. Because COCH3 is at position 1, Cl at 4. So, position 2 is ortho to 1 (COCH3) and meta to Cl (position 4). Similarly, position 6 is ortho to 1 and meta to Cl.

Hs at positions 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl (position 4) and meta to COCH3 (position 1).

So their chemical shifts would be influenced by the substituents they're adjacent to.

In terms of chemical shifts, Hs ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like COCH3) would be more deshielded (higher ppm), while Hs ortho to Cl would be less deshielded (lower ppm) because Cl is also electron-withdrawing but less so than a ketone? Or wait, Cl is more electronegative and withdrawing than a ketone group? Wait, I'm not sure about the relative strengths. Maybe the ketone is a stronger deactivating group than Cl.

So, the Hs ortho to COCH3 would appear downfield (higher ppm) than those ortho to Cl.

In the NMR, that would mean two doublets in the aromatic region: one at higher ppm (say 7.8 ppm) for the COCH3-ortho Hs, and another at lower ppm (7.6 ppm) for the Cl-ortho Hs. Each would be a doublet because each H is coupled with one adjacent H.

So in the aromatic region, the NMR would show a 2H doublet at ~7.8 ppm and another 2H doublet at ~7.6 ppm.

Additionally, the COCH3 group would have a singlet for the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. The CH3 in COCH3 would be a singlet because it's attached to a carbonyl (no neighboring Hs). The CH3 would appear around 2.3-2.6 ppm, typically.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That fits. The 2H doublets in aromatic and the 3H singlet for the CH3 in COCH3.

Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which suggests an aldehyde, but our substituent is COCH3, not CHO. So option A is more likely to be for a benzaldehyde derivative, not a ketone.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are higher than typical aromatic protons. Those might be for CH2 groups next to O, but I don't see that in our structure.

Option D: 6.9 ppm singlet, which is not in the aromatic region for a substituted benzene with strong electron-withdrawing groups. Also has 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which might not fit.

So option C seems to fit. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, and a singlet for the CH3 in the ketone group.

Wait, but let me check the total carbons. The benzene (6 C) plus Cl and COCH3 (2 C) makes 8. Yes.

So the correct NMR would have:

- Two doublets in aromatic region (2H each)
- A singlet for the CH3 (3H)

Looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That matches.

I think that's correct.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. A benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, and the two substituents account for the remaining 2 carbons. Based on the FTIR data, the compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (e.g., Cl or Br). This suggests the substituents are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as a ketone (-COCH₃). The structure is likely para-substituted, with the halogen and ketone group on opposite positions of the benzene ring.

In the NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons will split into two sets due to the substituents' electronic effects. The protons ortho to the carbonyl group (-COCH₃) will be more deshielded (downfield) and appear as a doublet at a higher chemical shift (~7.8 ppm). The protons ortho to the halogen (Cl) will be less deshielded and appear as a doublet at a lower chemical shift (~7.6 ppm). Additionally, the methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the carbonyl will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which corresponds to an aldehyde proton. However, the compound contains a ketone group (-COCH₃), not an aldehyde. This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Shows signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are characteristic of protons near electronegative atoms (e.g., O or N). These signals do not match the expected NMR pattern for the given compound. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Contains two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm) for the ortho protons and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for the methyl group of the ketone. This matches the expected NMR pattern for the compound. This option is correct.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which is inconsistent with the expected aromatic protons for this compound. Additionally, the signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not relevant to the structure. This option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**.
