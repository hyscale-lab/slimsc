Okay, so I've got this problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx, with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The speed of light is c, so we're definitely dealing with relativistic effects here.

Wait, in the classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², and when it's converted to kinetic energy, (1/2)mv², so v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's option C. But the question is about a relativistic case, so that might not hold anymore.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore, right? The correct relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in a relativistic oscillator would be different.

Wait, but how does the potential energy work in a relativistic oscillator? Actually, in the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², so in relativistic cases, maybe the potential remains the same, but the kinetic is updated.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says it's a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. So the potential is still (1/2)kx². But the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So E = K.E. = (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but that's when the particle is moving the fastest. So setting those equal:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So, solving for gamma.

Gamma = ( (1/2
