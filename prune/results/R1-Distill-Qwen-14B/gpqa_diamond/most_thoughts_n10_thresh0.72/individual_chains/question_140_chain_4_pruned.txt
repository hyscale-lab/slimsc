Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it slow.

First, let's read the problem again. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has molecules where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. And the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Alright, let's start by identifying the substances involved.

Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Maybe CO2? No, wait, CO2 is a gas but the molecule has 12 (for C) and 16*2 for O, but that's about atoms, not protons and neutrons. Wait, I'm supposed to think of the molecule as a whole.

Wait, the molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons. Each molecule. Let's think of possible diatomic or triatomic gases. For example, maybe H2O? No, that's a liquid. Or maybe CH4? No, not a gas in this context. Or maybe NH3? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the gas is something like CO2. Wait, but the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Let's think of each molecule's total protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe it's something like H2O. Wait, H2O has two H atoms (each with 1 proton) and one O (8 protons). So total protons in molecule: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: O has 8 neutrons, H has none. So total neutrons: 8. So 10 protons, 8 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, what about H2? Each H has 1 proton, so H2 has 2 protons. Neutrons? H is 1, so no neutrons. So 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not equal. What about something like O2? O has 8 protons, so O2 has 16 protons. Neutrons: each O has 8, so total 16. Wait, that's 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So 16 each. That fits. So W could be O2.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic gas. Alternatively, maybe another molecule. Wait, let me think about another possibility. Let's see, maybe the gas is CH4. Protons: C (6) + 4 H (1 each) = 10. Neutrons: C has 6 (since it's mostly ^12C), and H has none. So total neutrons: 6. 10 vs 6, not equal. Hmm.

Another option: CO. C has 6 protons, O has 8, so total protons 14. Neutrons:
