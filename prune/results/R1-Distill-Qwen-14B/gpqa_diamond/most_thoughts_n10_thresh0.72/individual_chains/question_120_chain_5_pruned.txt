Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me try to think this through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in space, right? So, the density is the same everywhere. Now, it's asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, so I need to figure out the exponent.

Wait, what do I remember about parallax? Oh right, parallax (p) is related to distance. The formula I recall is distance (d) in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax, so d = 1/plx. So when parallax increases, the distance decreases because you're dividing 1 by a bigger number. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, their spatial density is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume should depend on the volume. But how does that translate to parallax?

Let me think about the volume in terms of distance. In three dimensions, volume scales with the cube of distance. So, if you have a sphere of radius d, the volume is (4/3)πd³. Since d is 1/plx, substituting that in, the volume would be proportional to (1/plx)^3, which is 1/plx³.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if I consider a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell is the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness. So, volume element dV = 4πd² dd.

Substituting d = 1/plx, so dd is the change in distance. Let's express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, the negative just indicates direction, but since we're considering small increments, maybe I can ignore the sign for now.

So, substituting d as 1/plx into dV, we get dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But dd is - (1/plx²) d
