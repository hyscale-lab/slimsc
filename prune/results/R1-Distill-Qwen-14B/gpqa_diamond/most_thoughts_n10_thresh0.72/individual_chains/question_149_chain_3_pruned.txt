Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this NMR and LC-MS question about a synthesized peptidic compound. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks good except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. They rule out spin-spin coupling, so it's not a splitting issue. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass. Hmm.

So the NMR has duplicate peaks for the same proton. Wait, why would that happen? Since the shifts are similar and integrals add to 1H, maybe it's not diastereomers because those would have different shifts. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out too. Could it be something else like a diastereomer causing different environments? Or maybe it's some kind of isomerism that doesn't split the signals.

Looking at the options: 

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? The LC-MS shows same mass, so probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so LC-MS would show one peak since they're usually not separated by LC unless it's a chiral column. But the question says two peaks of equal intensity. Wait, but LC-MS at elevated temperature—maybe the column isn't chiral. So enantiomers might not separate. Or wait, maybe the crude compound is a racemic mixture, but in LC-MS, if the column isn't chiral, they would elute together. So why two peaks? That's confusing. Maybe the NMR would see enantiomers as a single peak because they're mirror images, so the NMR wouldn't show two peaks. So not B, perhaps?

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not sure what that means. Double coupling—maybe some kind of coupling that leads to two signals? Or perhaps a side reaction where the same proton is coupling with two different environments. Alternatively, maybe it's a situation where there's an impurity that's a diastereomer but with the same molecular weight? Wait, same mass but different structure. But the
