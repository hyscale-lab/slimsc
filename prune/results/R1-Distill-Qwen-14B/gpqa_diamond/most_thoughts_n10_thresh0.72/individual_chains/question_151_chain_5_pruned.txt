Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question says.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, no. Oh, wait, no, the state is a column vector with those elements. So the state vector is a 3x1 matrix. Let me write that down:

State vector ψ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually unit vectors, right? So I should check if this is a normalized state. Hmm, because if not, I might have to normalize it first. Let me calculate the norm squared of ψ.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is about 2.45. So the state isn't normalized yet. So I need to normalize it before proceeding, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to have a norm of 1.

Wait, but wait, the observable is represented by matrix P. The question asks for the probability that measuring observable P gives 0. So I'm pretty sure the steps I need to take are:

1. Normalize the state vector ψ.
2. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P because the possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state ψ.
3. Alternatively, another method is to compute ψ† P ψ because that gives the expectation value, but wait, no. Wait, no. Because the expectation value is <P>, but here we're looking for the probability of getting a specific eigenvalue, which is 0 in this case.

Wait, no, maybe another approach. The observable P is a matrix, and to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then project the state ψ onto each of these eigenvectors and sum the squares of their magnitudes.

But wait, first, I should find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are 0. Let's look at matrix P.

Matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0,
