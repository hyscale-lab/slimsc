Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electric potential energy calculations. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or gravity here. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, so I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Since the system is isolated, I guess we're considering the potential energy due to the configuration of the charges. The minimum energy... wait, in electrostatics, the potential energy is usually a minimum when the configuration is the most stable, like when the charges are as close as possible. But wait, in this case, the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from point P, where the 13th charge is. So I don't think their positions can change from that setup.

Wait, so the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m away. So the system comprises the 13th charge and the 12 others. Since all are identical and same sign (since each is 2e, which is positive if e is positive), they would repel each other. But since 12 are fixed, maybe their positions don't change. So the energy here is the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th one at P.

Wait, but also, the 12 charges are at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. So the potential energy between each pair is the same. So the total potential energy is the sum of each of these interactions.

But wait, also, the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Oh wait, but if they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, I'm not sure if their mutual distances are fixed as well. The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but it doesn't say anything about their mutual distances. So I think that in this scenario, the mutual potential energy between the
