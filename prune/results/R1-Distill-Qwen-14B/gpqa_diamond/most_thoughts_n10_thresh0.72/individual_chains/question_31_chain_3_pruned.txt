Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of product 3, with options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that nitric acid and sulfuric acid are often used as nitrating agents. So, the first step is probably a nitration reaction. Toluene undergoing nitration would form nitrotoluene. I think nitrotoluene has a nitro group attached to the methyl group. Wait, no, waitâ€”toluene is benzene with a methyl group. The nitration would typically occur at the para position because the methyl is an activating group. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene, right? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me think: when toluene is nitrated, the nitro group can enter ortho, meta, or para positions, but since methyl is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group), the nitration will occur more in the positions where the ring is activated.

Wait, no, wait. No, the nitro group is a meta director. Oh wait, no! Wait, nitration is a nitration reaction, which is a strong nitrating agent, and it's a meta director. Wait, no, the position of nitration depends on the substituent already present. Toluene has a methyl group which is an activating group, ortho/para directing. So the nitration would happen in the para position, right? So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Wait, but sometimes, the nitration can also occur in the ortho and meta, but the main product is para. Because methyl is a strong activating group, so the nitro group (which is deactivating and meta-directing) would go to para, I think. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. I remember that when nitrotoluene is oxidized, the methyl group attached to the benzene ring gets oxidized. So the methyl group, which is CH3, when oxidized, would become a COOH group. So product 2 would be benzoic acid with a nitro group attached. Wait, let me visualize this: the benzene ring has a nitro group and a COOH group. Where are they located? Since the nitro group was in the para position relative to the methyl in product 1, after oxidation, the COOH will be in the same position as the methyl was. So the COOH group is attached to the benzene ring in the position where the methyl was, which is adjacent to the nitro group. Wait no, the original structure: toluene is benzene with CH3. The nitration adds NO2 to the para position. So, the
