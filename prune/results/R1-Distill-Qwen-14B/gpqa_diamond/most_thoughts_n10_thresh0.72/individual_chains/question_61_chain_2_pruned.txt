Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product step by step. Let me start by breaking down each reaction and see what's happening.

The first step is treating benzene with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitration typically happens in a nitrating mixture which is a mix of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution here. The nitronium ion acts as the electrophile. Benzene usually gets the nitro group in the meta position if there's another substituent, but wait, initially, benzene is just a benzene ring. Wait, no, when benzene is nitrated for the first time, the nitro group enters in a certain position.

Wait, benzene itself is symmetric, so the nitration would produce nitrobenzene. But wait, nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene as a single product because benzene is symmetric. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Oh, I think this is a bromination reaction. Iron in the presence of bromine usually is for substitution. But wait, when you have a nitro group, it's a strong meta-directing group. So the bromine would add in the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, nitrobenzene has the nitro group attached. The bromination would add Br at the position that's meta to nitro. So in nitrobenzene
