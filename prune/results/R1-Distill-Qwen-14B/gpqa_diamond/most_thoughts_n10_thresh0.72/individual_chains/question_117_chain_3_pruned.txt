Okay, so I have this question about which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds have chiral centers, making them non-superimposable on their mirror images. So, the compounds need to have a lack of an internal plane of symmetry, right?

Looking at the options given:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

And the choices are A, B, C, D, each listing different compounds. Let's go through each one.

Starting with option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, biphenyl rings connected with substituents. I think biphenyls can have substituents in positions that may lead to the possibility of stereoisomerism. Wait, the substituents are on positions 2 and 6 on each ring? Let me visualize it. So, each phenyl ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. Then, the two rings are connected at the 1 position. So, looking at the substituents, are there any chiral centers here? The biphenyl structure itself is symmetric if the substituents are in such a way that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, the arrangement might lead to non-superimposable mirror images. Wait, but wait, the molecule has two rings connected. If the substituents are arranged such that each ring has the same substituents in corresponding positions, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but 6,6' would be opposite the point of connection. Let me think. If both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, the molecule might be meso. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then it could be chiral. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system itself can have some sort of stereoisomerism, like if there's a twist between the rings. Oh wait, but that's more about geometric isomerism perhaps. Wait, no, biphenyls can have E and Z isomerism
