Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. But wait, I need to think about the specifics here.

First, the problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of each solution. Let's jot them down:

- HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

I think the first step is to figure out how much of each acid and base I'm dealing with in terms of moles. Because enthalpy of neutralization depends on the moles reacting.

So, for each solution, moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). Let me calculate each.

For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so each mole gives one mole of H+ ions.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too. But wait, H2SO4 is diprotic. In its first dissociation, it donates two H+ ions. Wait no, wait. Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, actually, I think the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- isn't right. Wait, no. Let me think again. Actually, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is correct because H2SO4 is a strong acid, but wait no, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no. Let me correct this. H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation: it dissociates completely into H+ and HSO4^- in the first step. The second dissociation, HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, is also pretty much complete, I think. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.
