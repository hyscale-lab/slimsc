Okay, I have this question about molecular biology, specifically about transgenic mice and gene expression. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're adding a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and are having trouble getting the protein to overexpress. So, when they look at the construct's plus strand sequence, there's an issue.

The options given are A to D. I need to figure out which one is the problem.

First, looking at the sequence provided. I'll try to read through it and see if there are any obvious issues that might prevent proper expression.

The coding sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then, after that, the nucleotides are coding for the hemagglutinin tag, I think. Wait, the question says the coding sequence was modified to add the HA determinant at the N-terminus. So the HA sequence should be right after the start codon.

Looking at the sequence: ATG is at the beginning, then TAC. Wait, TAC is Tyr. So the sequence starts ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Hmm, wait, the HA tag is a specific sequence. The HA tag is typically YPYDHHQTY (or something like that), but that's the amino acid sequence which would translate from the DNA sequence.

Wait, but in the given DNA, the HA might not be correctly added. Let me see: the first part after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Let me translate that into amino acids.

ATG is methionine. Then TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine, GAT is aspartic acid, G is glycine? Wait, wait, each codon is three letters. Let me write them out.

The first few codons (including the start):

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACG CCA AA... etc.

So, ATG is Methionine (start). TAC is Tyr, then CCA Pro, TAC Tyr, GAT Asp, GTC is Val, CAG is Gln, ATT is Ile, ACG is Thr, CCA Pro, etc.

So the initial part of the protein would be Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, Gln, Ile, Thr, Pro... That doesn't look like the HA tag. HA is usually around 11 amino acids, starting with YPY (Tyr Pro Tyr). So here, the first few are Tyr, Pro, Tyr... Wait, that's the first three amino acids after Met? Let's see: the second codon is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr). So the first few amino acids are Met,
