Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options provided.

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. So, a benzene ring with two substituents. The total number of carbons is 8. Wait, benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add 2 more carbons. But wait, wait. Let's think: each substituent might contribute more than one carbon.

Wait, the substituents are probably two groups attached to the benzene. So, the benzene has two substituents, each of which has a certain number of carbons. The total carbons in the molecule are 8. Let's compute: benzene is 6 carbons. So substituents contribute 2 more carbons. So each substituent could be a single carbon group, like two -CH2- groups, but that would make the substituents something else. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and another is a halogen? Wait, but the IR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents should include a carbonyl group and a halogen. 

Wait, but wait. The substituents are attached to the benzene ring. So each substituent is a group. Let's think: the IR shows a carbonyl, so that's a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. Also, the aromatic-halogen bond suggests a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring, like Cl, Br, etc.

So, the two substituents on the benzene are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. So, what could those substituents be?

Let me think about possible structures. For instance, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group like a ketone (CO-) and the other is a halogen (X). But wait, a ketone substituent would be something like a C=O attached to the ring via a carbon. So, for example, benzophenone has a carbonyl group attached. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetyl group (CH3CO-) attached to the ring.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the molecular formula. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so substituents must contribute 2 carbons. If one substituent is a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone, that would be a single carbon attached as a carbonyl. For example, acetophenone is a benzene ring with a propanone group (COCH3). Wait, but that would add two carbons (the CO is attached to CH3). So, the substituent would be a ketone (like -COCH3), which is two carbons. Then, the other substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any carbons. So that would make the total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (from COCH3) + 0 (from X) = 8. That fits.

Wait, but wait. Let's count: Benzene (6) + COCH3 (2 carbons) + X (like Cl, which is 0 carbons) gives 8 total. So that's possible. So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (like COCH3) and a halogen (like Cl).

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another is a halogen, perhaps in a para position or some other arrangement.

Wait, but the question says it's a di-substituted benzene, so there are two substituents.
