Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene was dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR peaks: a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in 13C NMR. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, with the formula C13H16O3.

The key part is that the 2D NOESY NMR of the major product has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product's spectrum.

First, I need to figure out what the starting anhydride looks like. Let's break down the NMR data. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, probably due to an aromatic proton. But wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. So maybe the alkene is now part of a ring structure?

Wait, another possibility: the cis-alkene in the dicarboxylic acid would become a ring upon dehydration. For example, a maleic acid derivative. Maleic anhydride has a structure with an oxygen bridge and a double bond. Let me think about the structure. Maleic anhydride has two carbonyl groups attached to an oxygen ring. In its NMR, the protons on the double bond would be deshielded. But wait, the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. If it's a doublet from a trans alkene, but perhaps in this case, the structure forms a cyclic anhydride where the double bond is between two carbonyl groups. Wait, but in that case, the protons would
