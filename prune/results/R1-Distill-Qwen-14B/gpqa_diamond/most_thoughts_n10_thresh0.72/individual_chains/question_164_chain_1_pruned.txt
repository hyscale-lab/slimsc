Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass, and their motion can be studied through things like radial velocity curves. The question gives me two systems, system_1 and system_2, each with their own periods and radial velocity amplitudes. I need to find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Let me start by jotting down the given data. 

System_1:
- Eclipsing period: 2 years.
- Radial velocity (RV) amplitudes: 10 km/s and 5 km/s.

System_2:
- Eclipsing period: 1 year.
- RV amplitudes: 15 km/s and 10 km/s.

Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses. I think this period is the orbital period of the binary system. So both systems have different orbital periods. System_1's orbital period is longer than system_2's.

Now, the problem asks about the mass of each system. It says the mass is the sum of the two stars. So I need to find M1 (mass of system 1) and M2 (mass of system 2), then find M1/M2.

I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity semi-amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. The formula I think is something like K = (v) = (2πG/(P))^(1/3) * (M2/( (M1 + M2)^2 )) )^(1/1) ), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(-1/3) * ( M2 sin i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )^(1/3) )

But wait, I think for a spectroscopic binary, each star's RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to its mass. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, hence smaller velocity. So if K1 is the semi-amplitude of star 1, and K2 for star 2, then K1/K2 = M2/M1.

Wait, that might be correct. Because if M1 is larger, K1 would be smaller. So (K1)(M1) = (K2)(M2). Because the product of mass and velocity is the same for both stars in the binary system. Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the center of mass.

Yes, the center of mass requires M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. And since velocity v = 2πa / P (for circular orbit), so v1 = (2π a1)/P, v2 = (2π a2)/P. So v1 / v2 = a1 / a2 = (M2) / (M1). So v1 = (M2/M1) * v2. Hmm, but wait, K is the semi-amplitude of radial velocity, which is v1 for star 1 and v2 for star 2.

Wait, but the formula I think is K
