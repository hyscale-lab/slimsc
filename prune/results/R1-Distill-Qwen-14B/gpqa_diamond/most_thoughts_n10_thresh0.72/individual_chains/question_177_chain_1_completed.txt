Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Okay, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's see, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, the problem is about luminosity, which I think relates more to temperature and radius than mass. So maybe the mass part is a red herring or maybe not. I'll have to think about that.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. That's useful because luminosity depends on temperature as well as radius and other factors.

Luminosity of a star (if it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same temperature (T1 = T2), the luminosity ratio L1/L2 should be (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the (T1/T2)^4 part is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring that, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Hmm, that would suggest the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, let me check. The problem mentions radial velocities. Oh, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect anything?

Oh, wait, the Doppler effect! The Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. But in this problem, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So if their rest wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear at the same observed wavelength, that might affect their temperatures.

Wait a second, maybe I was wrong earlier. Because if the stars are moving towards or away from us, the observed λ_max would be different from their rest λ_max. So perhaps I should adjust the temperatures based on the Doppler effect.

Let me think. The Doppler shift formula is approximately (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light. But wait, velocity affects the observed wavelength. Let me recall the formula. The Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away.

Wait, actually, the exact formula depends on whether the source is moving towards or away. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). If moving towards, it's shorter (blueshifted). So, the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) for relativistic speeds, but if v is small compared to c, then λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c).

In this problem, Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but is it moving towards or away? The question says 700 km/s for Star_2. Radial velocity can be positive or negative depending on direction. Let's assume it's moving away. Because the problem gives a positive value. So, the observed maximum wavelength for Star_2 would be longer than its rest wavelength.

But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max are equal. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But λ1_obs is λ1_rest * (1 + v1/c), and λ2_obs is λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, no, because for Star_1, v1 is zero, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2, v2 is 700 km/s. Let me check the direction: if it's moving away, then v is positive, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c). So for their observed wavelengths to be the same, we have:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But λ is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought both have the same observed λ_max, which made me think their temperatures are same. But perhaps that's not correct because of Doppler shift.

Hold on, let me reevaluate. The actual temperatures of the stars would be related to their rest wavelengths. Because when a star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted, but the rest wavelength is what determines its temperature.

So, let's denote:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v1=0)
λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c) (assuming v2 is positive, which is moving away)

But the problem says λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Rearranging:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Wait, no: Let me do it correctly.

From λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

But λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2/(T1) = 1 + v2/c

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Hmm, that's interesting. So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1. So earlier assumption that T1 = T2 was incorrect because I didn't account for Doppler shift.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let's plug in the numbers. v2 is 700 km/s. The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So v2/c is 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So the temperature of Star_2 is about 0.233% higher than that of Star_1.

Now, the luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴.

So the ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T2 = T1*(1 + 0.002333) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.002333) → T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 / T1 = 1.002333.

Therefore,

(T1 / T2)⁴ = (1/1.002333)⁴.

Let me compute 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

Raising this to the fourth power: (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute that.

0.99767 squared is approximately (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99534 + negligible.

Wait, 0.99767 * 0.99767 = about 0.99535.

Then, squaring that again: 0.99535^2 ≈ (1 - 0.00465)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00465 + (0.00465)^2 → about 0.9907.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.99535 squared.

0.99535 * 0.99535:

= (1 - 0.00465)^2

= 1 - 2*0.00465 + (0.00465)^2

= 0.9907 - 0.0000216225 ≈ 0.990678.

So (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.990678.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ 0.990678.

So putting it all together,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4 = (2.25) * (0.990678) ≈ 2.25 * 0.990678 ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 2.25 * 0.990678.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

But wait, 0.990678 is a bit higher than 0.99, so 2.25 * 0.990678 ≈ 2.25 * (0.99 + 0.000678) ≈ 2.2275 + 0.0015255 ≈ 2.229.

Hmm, so approximately 2.229, which is around 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier without considering Doppler shift, I thought it was 2.25 (option A). But with Doppler, the luminosity ratio is a bit less than that because T2 is a bit higher than T1, which reduces the luminosity ratio.

So why is the luminosity ratio less than 2.25? Because the denominator in the luminosity ratio is T2^4. So T2 is a bit bigger than T1, so T1^4 / T2^4 is a bit less than 1, making the overall ratio a bit less than 2.25.

So the correct factor should be approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but how significant is the Doppler effect here? Because v is 700 km/s which is about 0.23% of the speed of light. So the temperature ratio is T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.002333), which is a small increase. The impact on the luminosity, which is T^4, would be (1 + 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*0.002333 (using binomial approx for small x: (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx). So 4 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.00933. So 1.00933. Oh wait, no, because in this case, it's (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1.002333)]^4 ≈ (1 - 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*0.002333 ≈ 0.990668. So the factor is 0.990668, which is a reduction of about 0.933% of 2.25.

So 2.25 * 0.990668 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990668 ≈ 2.229.

So the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, so:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. This implies that the observed wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are equal:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}}
\]

Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}\), the rest wavelengths are related to the temperatures as:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Here, \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) is Star_2's radial velocity, and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\) is the speed of light. Simplifying:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{v_2}{c}
\]

Substituting \(v_2/c = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333\):

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} \approx 1.002333 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Contribution to Luminosity
The temperature term in the luminosity ratio is \((T_1/T_2)^4\). Using the approximation \((0.99767)^4\):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 0.990678
\]

### Step 4: Final Luminosity Ratio
Combining the radius and temperature contributions:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.990678 \approx 2.229
\]

### Conclusion
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2. Therefore, the correct answer is:
