Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that the rhombohedral structure has all the edges equal, and all the angles are the same. So alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees in this case. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance—so the distance between atoms along each edge is 10 Å? Or is it the lattice parameter 'a' which is 10? I think in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameter 'a' is the edge length, so that's 10 Angstrom here.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. Oh right, that's given by the formula involving the Miller indices.

I remember the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is something like d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h^2 u + k^2 v + l^2 w) ), but wait, that's maybe for orthorhombic systems. Or wait, no, rhombohedral is a special case, so perhaps a different formula applies.

Wait, no, another approach. The general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * something related to the angles ). Hmm, maybe I should recall the correct formula for rhombohedral systems.

Oh wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is derived from the structure factor, considering the angles between the lattice vectors. In a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice vectors are all equal, a, and the angles between them are all the same, given here as 30 degrees.

The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk(2 cos α) - hl(2 cos α) - kl(2 cos α) ), because the angles between the vectors are all α. Oh wait, wait! Let me get this straight. Because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined with vectors a, b, c, all equal in length (a), and the angles between a and b is alpha, between b and c is beta, and between a and c is gamma. But in this problem, alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

Wait, no, I think the formula for d_hkl in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * 2 cos α )

Wait, is that right? Because in the case of a cubic system, where all angles are 90 degrees, cos 90 is zero, so the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²),
