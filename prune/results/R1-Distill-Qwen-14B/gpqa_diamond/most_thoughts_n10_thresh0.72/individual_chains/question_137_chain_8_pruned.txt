Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my accelerator physics, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about a proton being injected into a synchrocyclotron with negligible kinetic energy, so T is almost zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The options are A to D, and I need to find how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, wait. Synchrocyclotrons... aren't they a type of cyclotron where the magnetic field is varied with time to keep the particles in phase with the accelerating voltage? Unlike the regular cyclotron which uses a static field, synchrocyclotrons change the magnetic field so that the particles can be accelerated beyond what a fixed field would allow. Right, so as the particle gains energy, the magnetic field decreases, keeping the cyclotron frequency adjusted.

So the key here is probably figuring out the relationship between the applied voltage, the kinetic energy gained, and the number of revolutions. But I'm a bit hazy on the exact formulas.

I remember that in cyclotrons, the time it takes for a particle to complete a revolution (the period) depends on the magnetic field. But in a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field changes, the frequency might change as well. Oh wait, but the applied voltage is an alternating voltage, which suggests that the system is designed to have the particles in phase with the oscillating electric field.

Let me think about the acceleration part. The voltage U(t) is the potential difference that the proton experiences. Since it's an AC voltage, the effective voltage that does work on the proton would relate to the amplitude of the voltage. The kinetic energy gained by the proton is related to the integral of the accelerating voltage over time, I suppose.

Wait, but since the proton starts with negligible kinetic energy, the total kinetic energy T1 is the energy gained from the voltage. So maybe the energy gained per revolution is the peak voltage multiplied by some factor, perhaps the charge of the proton.

The energy gained per revolution would be the voltage times the charge. The voltage here is time-varying, so the average power or energy per cycle might come into play.

Wait, but the voltage is given as U0 cos(...), so the peak voltage is U0. The work done on the proton per cycle would be e * U0, where e is the elementary charge. Because each cycle, the voltage would add e*U0 to the energy. But wait, that might not be exactly right because the particle's velocity is increasing, and the time per revolution is decreasing. Hmm, but in a synchrocyclotron, perhaps the particles are kept in phase, so each time the voltage peaks, the proton is at the right point to be accelerated.

Wait, but the problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations. So maybe each cycle of the voltage gives a certain energy gain. Or perhaps each half-cycle? Because the voltage is oscillating, maybe each peak gives an acceleration.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is equal to e multiplied by the peak voltage,
