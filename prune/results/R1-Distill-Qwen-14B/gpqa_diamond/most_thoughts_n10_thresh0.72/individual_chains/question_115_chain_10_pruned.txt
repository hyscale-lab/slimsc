Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll give it a go. Let me read the question again and break it down.

So, we have an electron moving along a horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are in the upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. I remember that in particle-antiparticle annihilations, like electron-positron, they usually produce gamma rays or photons. Since they have equal and opposite momenta before collision, the total momentum should be conserved after the collision.

Wait, so the initial system has the electron and positron moving towards each other. Let's think about their momenta. The Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. The electron's gamma is 4 and the positron's is 2. Wait, but wait: the positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so it has the same mass, but opposite charge.

But in terms of momentum, each particle's momentum is gamma * m * v, right? But since both are moving along the same line, their directions are opposite.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact setup. The electron is moving from left to right, and the positron from right to left. Oh wait no, the question says the positron is moving from the right. So, the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, no. The electron is moving along the horizontal from the left, so direction is positive x. The positron is moving along the horizontal from the right, which would be towards the left, so negative x direction.

So let's model this. Let's set up coordinates: x-axis horizontal, y vertical. The initial momenta of both particles are along the x-axis.

The electron has gamma =4. Let's calculate its momentum. The momentum p_e = gamma * m_e * v_e. But wait, m_e is the rest mass, same for both. The positron has gamma=2, so p_p = gamma * m_e * v_p.

But wait, since they're
