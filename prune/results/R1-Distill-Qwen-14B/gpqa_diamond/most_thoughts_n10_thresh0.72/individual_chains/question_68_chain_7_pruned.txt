Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin 1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I remember that spin relates to angular momentum, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The problem says there's a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and the magnetic moment is aligned with it. So that means the particle's magnetic moment is along Z, right?

Then the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both have the same magnitude B. So we're switching the direction of the magnetic field from Z to Y. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, and the Hamiltonian is something like -mu·B. Since mu is gamma Sz, the original Hamiltonian was H_initial = -gamma Sz B. When the field is along Z, the energy levels are determined by Sz.

So before the field change, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is suddenly switched to Y, the system's Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian will be H_final = -gamma (S·Y) B. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the magnetic field is along Y.

Wait, what's S·Y? The spin operator in the Y direction is Sy. So H_final is -gamma B Sy. But wait, let me get the signs right. The interaction energy is -mu·B, so H = - (gamma S) · B. So if B is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, no, wait. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S, so the interaction energy is mu·B = gamma S · B. But in the Hamiltonian, it's usually written as -mu·B, because the energy is minus the dot product. So H = -mu·B = -gamma S · B.

So when B is along Y, H becomes -gamma B Sy. So the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

Now, the system was initially in an eigenstate of Sz. After the field changes, the Hamiltonian is now proportional to Sy, so the eigenstates are eigenstates of Sy. So the state is no longer an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, which means it will evolve over time.

The question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. So the expectation value of Sz over time.

I remember that for a two-level system, when you have a state that's not an eigenstate, it can lead to oscillations in expectation values. The frequency of these oscillations is related to the energy difference between the states.

So the initial state is |+z>, since the field was along Z, and the moment was aligned. After the field change, the state isn't an eigenstate of H = -gamma B Sy. Let me think about the eigenvalues of Sy.

The spin matrices for Sx, Sy, Sz are proportional to the Pauli matrices. For spin-1/2, Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Oh wait, but in terms of the spin, S
