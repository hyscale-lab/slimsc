Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that the 1H NMR of a crude peptidic compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and together integrate to 1H, which is what you'd expect for a single proton. But why two peaks?

The options mention things like enantiomers, diastereoisomers, coupling, and contamination. Since the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, I can eliminate some possibilities. Spin-spin coupling would usually cause splitting into multiplets, but here the peaks are separate but same integral. So maybe it's not coupling between protons.

The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So same mass but two peaks. That suggests maybe two different compounds with the same mass? How is that possible? Wait, same mass would mean same molecular weight. But same molecular weight but different structures? Unless it's isomers. Or maybe same structure but different in some way that doesn't change the mass.

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. The precursor would have a different molecular weight, right? Because it's a starting material that hasn't undergone a reaction step. So in LC-MS, the precursor would have a lower mass. But the question says the mass is consistent with the expected molecule, so A is probably not it.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, same physical properties except for optical activity. They would look the same in mass spec. But in NMR, enantiomers would show the same peaks because the environment is the same, right? Unless the sample is not pure, but the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. Wait, but if they're enantiomers, their NMR spectra should be identical because the environments are mirror images but the protons are in the same environment. So the NMR wouldn't see two peaks for the same proton. So maybe B isn't the answer.

C) 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm a bit rusty here. Double coupling could lead to splitting in NMR. But earlier, the question states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the explanation. So the peaks aren't due to coupling to multiple protons. So maybe C isn't correct either.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including NMR shifts. So if there's a mixture, each diastereomer would have its own peak. The same mass because same molecular formula, so same mass in LC-MS. But in NMR, each diastereomer would have their own set of peaks. But the question says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So why would that happen?

Wait, another thought. If there are two diastereomers, each would have their own environment for the alpha protons. But in the NMR, each diastereomer would give a separate peak for the same proton in each molecule. So if the mixture is 50:50, each diastereomer contributes a peak, so two peaks for the same proton. That might explain the two peaks in the NMR.

But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So if the diastereomers have slightly different environments, the shifts would differ. But in the question, the shifts are similar, and the integrals add up to 1H. So that fits with each diastereomer having the same number of that proton (like each has one alpha proton), and each contributes a peak.

But wait, diastereomers could have the same number of protons but different shifts. So you'd get two peaks that are close in shift, but perhaps not exactly the same. Alternatively, if the diastereomers are in a certain configuration such that the alpha protons experience nearly the same environment, then their shifts would be similar, leading to two
