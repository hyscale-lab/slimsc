Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem here. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns, both achiral and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks appear in each case.

Hmm, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which I remember is an oxidizing agent, often used in epoxidation of alkenes. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific because the peracid adds across the double bond in a specific configuration. Oh right, it's an electrocyclic reaction, so the stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene.

Wait, Reaction 1 is with (E)-oct-4-ene. Let me draw that structure. Oct-4-ene is CH₂CH₂ in the middle, with substituents on either end. The E isomer would have the higher priority groups on opposite sides. So, for oct-4-ene, each end is ethyl (since octane is CH3(CH2)5CH2?), wait no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in positions 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2CH2 between two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2 in the middle, but more accurately, it's CH2CH2 with groups on either side. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the two higher priority groups (maybe the two CH2CH2CH2CH3 groups) are on opposite sides.

When mCPBA adds to (E)-oct-4-ene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, so the endo transition state leads to a specific configuration. Wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen atoms add with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene because it's a peracid. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed will have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide. So the product would be trans-4,5-epoxyoctane.

But wait, wait. Another thought: when mCPBA epoxidizes an alkene, the diastereomer of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form with the oxygen atoms on opposite sides, making a trans epoxide. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a cis epoxide.

So Reaction 1 product is trans-4,5-epoxide. Reaction 2 product is cis-4,5-epoxide.

Wait, but when the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, what happens? Aqueous acid usually leads to acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the attack of a water nucleophile on the more substituted carbon (due to carbocation stability), but wait, in an epoxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of a diol, with the stereochemistry depending on
