Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Alright, the question says: a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that when you have a charge near a conductor, the conductor induces charges. Oh right, the conducting sphere is grounded, so any induced charges will be such that the sphere's electric potential is zero. Because when grounded, the conductor's potential is the same as the Earth's, which we take as zero.

So the setup is: a point charge q is at a distance d from the center of the sphere. The sphere is conducting, so the charges will redistribute on the surface. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges will flow until the potential on the sphere is zero. But what actually happens?

I think the charge q will induce opposite charges on the sphere. The sphere's induced charges will be such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. So, the induced charge would be like -q times some factor. Wait, no, maybe not exactly -q. Let me think.

Wait, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charges together. So when we bring the charge q near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges will interact with q, and that contributes to the potential energy.

But wait, the sphere is grounded, so the potential at its surface is zero. So the potential at the surface due to all the charges (the charge q and the induced charges) must sum to zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should model this as the charge q and the image charge. In problems where a point charge is near a conductor, sometimes we use the method of images. But I'm not sure if that applies here, especially since the sphere is grounded.

Wait, in the method of images, for a conducting sphere, the image charge would be inside the sphere if the original charge is outside. The image charge's magnitude would depend on the distance. But since the sphere is grounded, the total charge on it is zero? Or not?

Wait, the sphere is conducting and grounded. So when a charge q is placed near it, it will induce charges on the sphere. The induced charges will consist of a charge -q' such that the potential
