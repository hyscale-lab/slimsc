Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question about hydrogen atom transitions. Hmm. Okay, the question is about the decay of the 3,0,0 state to the 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, selection rules. Right, for electric dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom, the selection rules are usually Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh wait, but Δn can be any integer, but in this case, it's a two-step process. The initial state is 3,0,0 going to 1,0,0. But it's a two-step decay, so the first transition would have to go from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state, then to 1,0,0.

So the first step, from n=3, l=0, m=0. Since l starts at 0, the next possible l would be l=1 because Δl can be ±1. So the intermediate state would have l=1. Let's think about the possible m values. The initial m is 0. So for the first transition, m can go to -1, 0, or +1. So possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. Wait, but wait, the initial n is 3, so the first transition has to go to a lower n. Like, maybe n=2, because from n=3 you can go to n=2 or n=1, but n=1 would require a larger Δn which might not fit the two-step decay.

Wait, the problem says it's two dipole transitions. So first, 3→something, then that something→1. So the intermediate step must be n=2 because if you go from 3→2 in the first step, then 2→1 in the second. That makes sense.

So the first transition is from 3,0,0 to 2,1, m. What m values are possible? Since m can change by 0, ±1, and initial m is 0, possible m's are -1, 0, +1. So the intermediate state could be |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, from the intermediate state (n=2, l=1, m?), we have to transition to n=1, l=0, m=0. So for the second transition, l must go from 1 to 0, which fits the Δl=±1 rule. And m must go from whatever it was to 0. So the m in the intermediate state must be either -1, 0, or +1, but in the second transition, m can only change by 0, ±1.

So for the second transition, starting from intermediate state m, the change must lead to m=0. So, the intermediate state's m can be -1, 0, or +1, but then in the next step, m must change by -1, 0, or +1 to reach 0. So for example, if the intermediate state is m=1, then to reach 0, it must change by -1. Similarly, m=0 stays, m=-1 changes by +1.

So all three possibilities of m in the intermediate state are allowed because in each case, the second transition can have m change appropriately.

But wait, the problem is about the possible transition paths and their probabilities. The options give specific paths, so perhaps I need to calculate the probabilities for each possible path.

Let me look at the options. Option A is 3→2,1,0 then to 1,0,0. The probability is 1/3. Option B is 3→2,1,1 then to 1,0,0, probability 1/4. Option C is 3→2,1,-1 then to 1,0,0, also 1/
