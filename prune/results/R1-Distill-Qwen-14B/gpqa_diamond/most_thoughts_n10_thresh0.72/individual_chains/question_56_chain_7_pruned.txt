Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I need to find the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, dipole transitions... I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by the selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So, from n=3 to n=1, that's a change of Δn = -2. But wait, dipole transitions usually involve Δn = ±1 because each dipole transition changes the energy level by one unit. Oh wait, but the question says it's via two dipole transitions. So the electron must first transition from n=3 to some intermediate state, then from there to n=1.

So the first transition is from n=3 to some n=2 or n=4? Well, since the final state is n=1, which is lower than 3, the first step must be a transition down. So from 3 to 2, because 4 would be higher, which isn't the case here.

So first, n=3 → n=2. What about l? The initial l is 0. Selection rule is Δl=±1. So from l=0, the next possible l is 1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. So the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩. What about m? The initial m is 0, so in the intermediate state, m can be -1, 0, or +1.

So the possible states after the first transition are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩.

Now, the second transition goes from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. Because n=2 can't go to n=0 directly in one dipole step (Δn must be ±1), so n=2 → n=1. And l=1 → l=0, which fits the selection rule (Δl= -1).

So the intermediate state must have l=1, and from there, it goes to l=0. So the possible intermediates are the |2,1,m⟩ states where m is -1, 0, or 1.

Now, the question is which of these intermediates can lead to the final state |1,0,0⟩.

For the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩. So m must change by Δm = 0, ±1.

So let's see:

If the first transition goes to |2,1,0⟩, then the second transition must have m=0 → 0. So Δm=0, which is allowed.

If the first transition is to |2,1,1⟩, then the second transition could go to m=0 (Δm=-1), which is allowed.

Similarly, if the first transition is to |2,1,-1⟩, the second could go to m=0 (Δm=+1), which is allowed.

So all three intermediates are possible in terms of selection rules.

But wait, the question says the transition is via two dipole transitions. So the process must be |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ for some m.

Now, the probability part. The options give different probabilities: 1/3, 1/4, 2/3.

Hmm, I think each possible intermediate has a certain probability, and the total is the sum. But let's think about the possible m values.

The first transition from |3,0,0⟩ can go to |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩.

But how likely are each of these?

The probability of each transition is related to the square of the matrix elements of the dipole operator. The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1,m}, so the matrix element for a transition from |n', l', m'| to |n, l, m> is proportional to <n l m | r Y_{1,m''} | n' l' m'>.

Wait, but for the first transition, initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the dipole operator will cause transitions to |2,1,m⟩, where m is -1,0,+1.

The matrix element for each m is the integral of the spherical harmonics multiplied by r and the other state.

But I don't remember the exact expressions, but I remember that for some m values, the integral might be zero or not.

Wait, for the initial state l=0, which is s-state (spherical symmetric), the integral for the matrix element will be non-zero only when the angular part can combine to give the necessary m. Since the initial Y_{0,0} is spherically symmetric, when multiplied by Y_{1,m}, the product must be able to include a Y_{l',m'} term with l' =1
