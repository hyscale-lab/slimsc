Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question about hydrogen atom transitions. Hmm. Okay, the question is about the decay of the 3,0,0 state to the 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, selection rules. Right, for electric dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom, the selection rules are usually Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh wait, but Δn can be any integer, but in this case, it's a two-step process. The initial state is 3,0,0 going to 1,0,0. But it's a two-step decay, so the first transition would have to go from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state, then to 1,0,0.

So the first step, from n=3, l=0, m=0. Since l starts at 0, the next possible l would be l=1 because Δl can be ±1. So the intermediate state would have l=1. Let's think about the possible m values. The initial m is 0. So for the first transition, m can go to -1, 0, or +1. So possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. Wait, but wait, the initial n is 3, so the first transition has to go to a lower n. Like, maybe n=2, because from n=3 you can go to n=2 or n=1, but n=1 would require a larger Δn which might not fit the two-step decay.

Wait, the problem says it's two dipole transitions. So first, 3→something, then that something→1. So the intermediate step must be n=2 because if you go from 3→2 in the first step, then 2→1 in the second. That makes sense.

So the first transition is from 3,0,0 to 2,1, m. What m values are possible? Since m can change by 0, ±1, and initial m is 0, possible m's are -1, 0, +1. So the intermediate state could be |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, from the intermediate state (n=2, l=1, m?), we have to transition to n=1, l=0, m=0. So for the second transition, l must go from 1 to 0, which fits the Δl=±1 rule. And m must go from whatever it was to 0. So the m in the intermediate state must be either -1, 0, or +1, but in the second transition, m can only change by 0, ±1.

So for the second transition, starting from intermediate state m, the change must lead to m=0. So, the intermediate state's m can be -1, 0, or +1, but then in the next step, m must change by -1, 0, or +1 to reach 0. So for example, if the intermediate state is m=1, then to reach 0, it must change by -1. Similarly, m=0 stays, m=-1 changes by +1.

So all three possibilities of m in the intermediate state are allowed because in each case, the second transition can have m change appropriately.

But wait, the problem is about the possible transition paths and their probabilities. The options give specific paths, so perhaps I need to calculate the probabilities for each possible path.

Let me look at the options. Option A is 3→2,1,0 then to 1,0,0. The probability is 1/3. Option B is 3→2,1,1 then to 1,0,0, probability 1/4. Option C is 3→2,1,-1 then to 1,0,0, also 1/

Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I need to find the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, dipole transitions... I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by the selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So, from n=3 to n=1, that's a change of Δn = -2. But wait, dipole transitions usually involve Δn = ±1 because each dipole transition changes the energy level by one unit. Oh wait, but the question says it's via two dipole transitions. So the electron must first transition from n=3 to some intermediate state, then from there to n=1.

So the first transition is from n=3 to some n=2 or n=4? Well, since the final state is n=1, which is lower than 3, the first step must be a transition down. So from 3 to 2, because 4 would be higher, which isn't the case here.

So first, n=3 → n=2. What about l? The initial l is 0. Selection rule is Δl=±1. So from l=0, the next possible l is 1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. So the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩. What about m? The initial m is 0, so in the intermediate state, m can be -1, 0, or +1.

So the possible states after the first transition are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩.

Now, the second transition goes from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. Because n=2 can't go to n=0 directly in one dipole step (Δn must be ±1), so n=2 → n=1. And l=1 → l=0, which fits the selection rule (Δl= -1).

So the intermediate state must have l=1, and from there, it goes to l=0. So the possible intermediates are the |2,1,m⟩ states where m is -1, 0, or 1.

Now, the question is which of these intermediates can lead to the final state |1,0,0⟩.

For the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩. So m must change by Δm = 0, ±1.

So let's see:

If the first transition goes to |2,1,0⟩, then the second transition must have m=0 → 0. So Δm=0, which is allowed.

If the first transition is to |2,1,1⟩, then the second transition could go to m=0 (Δm=-1), which is allowed.

Similarly, if the first transition is to |2,1,-1⟩, the second could go to m=0 (Δm=+1), which is allowed.

So all three intermediates are possible in terms of selection rules.

But wait, the question says the transition is via two dipole transitions. So the process must be |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ for some m.

Now, the probability part. The options give different probabilities: 1/3, 1/4, 2/3.

Hmm, I think each possible intermediate has a certain probability, and the total is the sum. But let's think about the possible m values.

The first transition from |3,0,0⟩ can go to |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩.

But how likely are each of these?

The probability of each transition is related to the square of the matrix elements of the dipole operator. The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1,m}, so the matrix element for a transition from |n', l', m'| to |n, l, m> is proportional to <n l m | r Y_{1,m''} | n' l' m'>.

Wait, but for the first transition, initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the dipole operator will cause transitions to |2,1,m⟩, where m is -1,0,+1.

The matrix element for each m is the integral of the spherical harmonics multiplied by r and the other state.

But I don't remember the exact expressions, but I remember that for some m values, the integral might be zero or not.

Wait, for the initial state l=0, which is s-state (spherical symmetric), the integral for the matrix element will be non-zero only when the angular part can combine to give the necessary m. Since the initial Y_{0,0} is spherically symmetric, when multiplied by Y_{1,m}, the product must be able to include a Y_{l',m'} term with l' =1
