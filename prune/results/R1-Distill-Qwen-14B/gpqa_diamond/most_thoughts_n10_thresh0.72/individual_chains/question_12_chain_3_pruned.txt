Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states: Find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two energies which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, okay, so this is a particle physics problem involving conservation laws. I remember that in particle decays, both energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest initially, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the products (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. 

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky. They have very little mass, right? I think the neutrino is considered massless in many problems, especially in introductory contexts. So if the neutrino is massless, its energy would be equal to its momentum times c, but since c is a constant, maybe we can just treat it as E = p for the neutrino in MeV terms if we're using the right units.

The pion is at rest, so the total initial energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The products must have energies adding up to this. Each product's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its energy is all kinetic. The muon, on the other hand, has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV; so its energy would be 105.7 + K_mu.

So let me set up the equations. Let's denote:

E1 = energy of muon = m_mu c² + K_mu = 105.7 + K_mu

E2 = energy of neutrino = p c (since m=0, so E = pc)

Also, since momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of their momenta must be equal because they're moving in opposite directions. So the momentum of the muon (p_mu) is equal to the momentum of the neutrino (p_nu). 

So, p_mu = p_nu = p.

Now, for the muon, the total energy is E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, wait. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So for the muon, E1 = sqrt( p² c² + (105.7)^2 ). Wait, but the units here can be a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of MeV and natural units where c=1. In particle physics, often c is set to 1, so equations become simpler.

In natural units (c
