Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's see.

So, the starting compound is A, which has the formula C3H6. I think that's propene, right? Because propene is C3H6, but wait, wait, another possibility is cyclopropane? No, cyclopropane is C3H6 too. But usually, when you brominate something, you're more likely dealing with alkenes. So maybe propene is the starting point.

Step 1: Bromination in CCl4. Propene is an alkene, and bromination in CCl4 is a dibromination via the bromine (Br2) adding across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3).

Step 2: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. This sounds like an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base, they undergo dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HX (here, HBr) twice, forming an alkene. So, eliminating two HBr molecules from 1,2-dibromopropane would give back propene. Wait, but wait: 1,2-dibromopropane eliminating HBr twice would form propene again? Because the starting material was propene, brominated, and then dehydrobrominated again to get back to propene. So compound C is propene again?

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane can eliminate in two different ways. Wait, that's not right. Wait, if you have 1,2-dibromopropane and eliminate two HBr molecules, you should form an alkene. The structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When you eliminate HBr from each Br, you can form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, but propene is CH2=CHCH3. But wait, 1,2-dibromopropane can eliminate to form 1-propene or possibly another isomer? Let me think: The molecule is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Eliminating HBr from the middle Br and one adjacent would lead to the double bond between C1 and C2, right? Because when you remove H from either side, you'll form the double bond between the first and second carbons. So the product C would be propene (CH2=CHCH3). So C is propene.

Wait, but wait—wait a second. Because when you eliminate vicinal dihalides with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, you typically form alkenes via E2 mechanisms. But the position of the double bond depends on the structure. In this case, the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, so the elimination would form propene (CH2=CHCH3). So C is propene.

Step 3: Compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, what's the reaction of propene with red-hot iron? Oh, wait, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation again? Or perhaps it's something else. Oh wait, wait, when alkenes are treated with hot iron in the presence of certain conditions, they can undergo dehydrogenation to form alkynes. Wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's a hydrogenation? No, hydrogenation would add H2, but I don't think that's it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but I'm not sure. Or wait, another possibility: when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's undergoing a polymerization reaction? No, that's usually under different conditions, like with a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction to form another compound.

Wait, but wait. Wait, another possibility: when propene is passed over a hot iron catalyst, like in the presence of a catalyst, it may form acetylene. Because, for example, the dehydrogenation of propane (which is similar) can form acetylene. So propene (C3H6) when heated over iron would lose H2 to form acetylene (C3H4?), but wait, wait. Wait, propene is C3H6. If it loses H2, it would form C3H4, which is 1-propyne (HC≡CCH2?), but wait, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, wait, perhaps it's more likely that when propene is passed over a hot iron, it undergoes a reaction to form an alkyne. So for that, propene would lose two H2 molecules, becoming propyne (which is C3H4). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because propene is C3H6. Let me think: propene → dehydrogenation → acetylene. Hmm, but how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the dehydrogenation of propene to form another compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration reaction. Wait, but propene is already an alkene, so it's not clear. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wait, maybe when propene is passed through a red-hot iron, it's a hydrogenation catalyst? No, because then it would add H2 to become propane. But the problem says it produces compound D. Hmm.
