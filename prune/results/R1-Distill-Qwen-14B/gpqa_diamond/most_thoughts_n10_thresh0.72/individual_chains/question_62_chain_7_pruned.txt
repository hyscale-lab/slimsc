Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw its structure to visualize it better. So, the main part is a cyclohexane ring. Attached to one carbon (position 1) is a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbonyl group (since it's an aldehyde). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is then attached to the cyclohexane. Also, there's an aldehyde group on the same carbon, I think? Or maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl and a hydroxymethyl group on the same carbon, which is also the position where the aldehyde is attached.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parse the IUPAC name. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached. The substituent at position 1 is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that substituent is a methyl group that's attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure would be cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1: this substituent is a CH2 group where one of the hydrogens is replaced by a hydroxyl group and the other by a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). And the cyclohexane also has a CHO group at position 1? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the main structure is cyclohexane, and at position 1, it's attached to a group that's a cyclohexyl and a hydroxymethyl. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) as a substituent. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl. So the structure is:

The cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group that has two other groups attached: a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). Also, the ring has a CHO group attached at some position, perhaps adjacent or not. Wait, no, the
