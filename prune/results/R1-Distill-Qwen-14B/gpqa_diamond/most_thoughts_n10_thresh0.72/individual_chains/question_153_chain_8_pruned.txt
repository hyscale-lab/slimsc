Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions. Hmm, it's about the Michael addition, which I remember is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to break this down.

The question has three parts: reactions (A), (B), and (C). Each involves different reactants and conditions, and we have to find the major products from each. The options give possible products for each part, so I need to figure out each reaction step by step.

Starting with reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I think NaOEt is a strong base, maybe acting as a base to deprotonate the malonate. Malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a conjugated diene with two ketone groups. Wait, no, dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. So when it reacts, the enolate would form, making it a nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituents in the E configuration. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(O)OCH3 attached to a double bond. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Or maybe the structure is like CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it. The acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH₃. But the 3-(p-tolyl) would mean that the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon in the chain. Oh wait, no: the acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO- with the methyl group, so the structure would be CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl)
