Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are four different acetate esters: Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, and Trans-butenyl acetates.

First, I need to understand what each structure looks like. Acetates are esters, so the general structure is CH3CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. In this case, the R groups are propenyl and butenyl, which have double bonds.

Let me recall the structures:

- Propenyl groups have three carbons, with a double bond. So propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2 but in an E or Z configuration. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2– but in the case of propenyl acetate, the ester is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, maybe I should think about the substituents.

Wait, no, the structure of propenyl acetate would be: the ester is OAc-O-CH2CH2CH2, but wait, no, propenyl has a double bond. Oh right, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2-OAc, but with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to think that propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3CH2CH2-OAc but with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should break it down. The options are propenyl and butenyl, which have three and four carbons respectively in the R group. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (but I think the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, making it CH2=CH-CH2-OAc). But wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2–, so the acetate would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps
