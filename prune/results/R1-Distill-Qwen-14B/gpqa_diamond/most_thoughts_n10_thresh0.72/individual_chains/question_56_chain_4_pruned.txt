Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that the |3,0,0> state decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels through emitting or absorbing photons, right? And these transitions follow certain selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions are important here. I think the main ones are: Δl = ±1 (the orbital angular momentum changes by 1), and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, right, and the other selection rule is Δn can be any integer except 0, but I think for a two-step transition, it's going to go through an intermediate state.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It needs to go down to n=1, l=0, m=0. So how?

Since l starts at 0, the next possible l after a dipole transition should be l=1. Because Δl = ±1, so 0 → 1. Then from l=1, another dipole transition must bring it to l=0 again. Because 1 can go to 0 (since Δl can be -1). So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0> to some |n',1,m'>. Then the second transition goes to |1,0,0>.

What about the possible m values? For the first transition, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So from m=0, the first transition could go to m=0, +1, or -1. But then, in the next transition, the m must go back to 0.

Wait, but the final state has m=0. So let's see. Let's consider each possibility.

First transition: say from m=0 to m=1. Then the second transition would need to go from m=1 to m=0. That's allowed since Δm can be -1. Alternatively, if the first transition goes to m=-1, then the second could adjust to m=0.

But wait, the options given have specific transitions. Let me look at them.

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Option B: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option C: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option D: I think it's similar to A but with different probability. Wait, the option says something's wrong because the first part of D is missing, but the second is |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, and the probability is 2/3.

Hmm, so the first transition in option A goes from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0. Then from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0. But wait, can you go from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0? Let's check the selection rules again. For a dipole transition, Δn can be anything except 0. So from n=2 to n=1 is allowed. And Δl must be ±1. Here, l=1 → l=0, so Δl = -1, which is allowed. And Δm would be 0 in this case. So that's allowed.

Similarly, in option B, the transition is from 3,0,0 to 2,1,1. Then from 2,1,1 to 1,0,0. Wait, can l=1 go to l=0? Yes. But the m changes from 1 to 0. So Δm is
