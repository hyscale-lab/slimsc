Okay, I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Let me think through this step by step. So, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. The options are about the possible transition routes and their probabilities.

Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons. Dipole transitions are allowed by certain selection rules. The selection rules for dipole transitions are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the transition is only allowed if l is not zero in either the initial or final state, but wait, I think I might be mixing that. Oh right, the dipole selection rules are: Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. So, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l changes by 1 each time.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So, n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0. Wait, but l goes from 0 to 0? That can't be a dipole transition because dipole transitions require l to change by ±1. So the direct transition from l=0 to l=0 would be forbidden. Therefore, the decay must happen in two steps.

So the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1. Because Δl can be +1 or -1, but since l was 0, it can only go to l=1. So the first step would be 3,0,0 → some state with l=1, and then in the second step, l would go down from 1 to 0.

Wait, but the initial state has l=0, so the first transition must be to a state with l=1. So the first state would have n=2 or maybe n=4? No, wait, because the energy levels are lower for lower n. Wait, but the decay is from n=3 to n=1, so it's a two-photon process. So perhaps the electron goes from n=3, l=0 → n=2, l=1, then from n=2, l=1 → n=1, l=0.

So the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m, where m can be 0, ±1. Wait, but the initial m is 0, so the m can change by 0, ±1. So the possible m for the first state could be 0, 1, or -1.

But in the second transition, the state must go from 2,1,m to 1,0,0. So the second transition must have m go from whatever it was to 0. So let's think about the m changes.

In the first transition, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So let's say in the first step, m goes from 0 to 0. Then in the second transition, m would have to go from 0 to 0 again. But wait, the selection rules for m are that Δm = 0, ±1. So if in the first
