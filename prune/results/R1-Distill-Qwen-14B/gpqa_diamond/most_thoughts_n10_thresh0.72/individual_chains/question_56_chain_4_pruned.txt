Okay, I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Let me think through this step by step. So, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. The options are about the possible transition routes and their probabilities.

Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons. Dipole transitions are allowed by certain selection rules. The selection rules for dipole transitions are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, the transition is only allowed if l is not zero in either the initial or final state, but wait, I think I might be mixing that. Oh right, the dipole selection rules are: Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. So, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l changes by 1 each time.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So, n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0. Wait, but l goes from 0 to 0? That can't be a dipole transition because dipole transitions require l to change by ±1. So the direct transition from l=0 to l=0 would be forbidden. Therefore, the decay must happen in two steps.

So the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1. Because Δl can be +1 or -1, but since l was 0, it can only go to l=1. So the first step would be 3,0,0 → some state with l=1, and then in the second step, l would go down from 1 to 0.

Wait, but the initial state has l=0, so the first transition must be to a state with l=1. So the first state would have n=2 or maybe n=4? No, wait, because the energy levels are lower for lower n. Wait, but the decay is from n=3 to n=1, so it's a two-photon process. So perhaps the electron goes from n=3, l=0 → n=2, l=1, then from n=2, l=1 → n=1, l=0.

So the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m, where m can be 0, ±1. Wait, but the initial m is 0, so the m can change by 0, ±1. So the possible m for the first state could be 0, 1, or -1.

But in the second transition, the state must go from 2,1,m to 1,0,0. So the second transition must have m go from whatever it was to 0. So let's think about the m changes.

In the first transition, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So let's say in the first step, m goes from 0 to 0. Then in the second transition, m would have to go from 0 to 0 again. But wait, the selection rules for m are that Δm = 0, ±1. So if in the first

Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that the |3,0,0> state decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels through emitting or absorbing photons, right? And these transitions follow certain selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions are important here. I think the main ones are: Δl = ±1 (the orbital angular momentum changes by 1), and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, right, and the other selection rule is Δn can be any integer except 0, but I think for a two-step transition, it's going to go through an intermediate state.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It needs to go down to n=1, l=0, m=0. So how?

Since l starts at 0, the next possible l after a dipole transition should be l=1. Because Δl = ±1, so 0 → 1. Then from l=1, another dipole transition must bring it to l=0 again. Because 1 can go to 0 (since Δl can be -1). So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0> to some |n',1,m'>. Then the second transition goes to |1,0,0>.

What about the possible m values? For the first transition, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So from m=0, the first transition could go to m=0, +1, or -1. But then, in the next transition, the m must go back to 0.

Wait, but the final state has m=0. So let's see. Let's consider each possibility.

First transition: say from m=0 to m=1. Then the second transition would need to go from m=1 to m=0. That's allowed since Δm can be -1. Alternatively, if the first transition goes to m=-1, then the second could adjust to m=0.

But wait, the options given have specific transitions. Let me look at them.

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Option B: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option C: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option D: I think it's similar to A but with different probability. Wait, the option says something's wrong because the first part of D is missing, but the second is |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, and the probability is 2/3.

Hmm, so the first transition in option A goes from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0. Then from 2,1,0 to 1,0,0. But wait, can you go from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0? Let's check the selection rules again. For a dipole transition, Δn can be anything except 0. So from n=2 to n=1 is allowed. And Δl must be ±1. Here, l=1 → l=0, so Δl = -1, which is allowed. And Δm would be 0 in this case. So that's allowed.

Similarly, in option B, the transition is from 3,0,0 to 2,1,1. Then from 2,1,1 to 1,0,0. Wait, can l=1 go to l=0? Yes. But the m changes from 1 to 0. So Δm is
