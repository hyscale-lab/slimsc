Okay, so I have this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember that when dealing with the excitation of atoms in stars, the Boltzmann equation is probably involved. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to temperature.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the ratio of their excitation is n1/n2 = 2. The energy difference given is 1.38e-23 J. I think that's the delta E between the two energy levels.

In LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the Boltzmann equation applies. The equation I remember is n_j/n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and g are the statistical weights.

Wait, but the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J, so E_j - E_i is that value. Also, it's given that the atoms are in specific energy levels, so I think we can assume that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both states, or maybe the problem says to ignore them. Because if g_j and g_i are the same, then the ratio g_j/g_i is 1. So that term drops out.

So the equation simplifies to n1/n2 = exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k*T) ). Wait, but wait, actually, in the problem, it's the excitation in a specific energy level. So maybe for each star, the excitation of that level is being considered. So star_1 has n1, star_2 has n2. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2.

But wait, how does temperature come into play? Let me think. Let's denote the energy difference as ΔE = E_j - E_i = 1.38e-23 J.

For star 1 and star 2, their temperatures are T1 and T2 respectively.

So for star 1: n1 = g exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star 2: n2 = g exp(-ΔE/(k T2))
So the ratio n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Simplify that: n1/n2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents. So:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, wait, that might be a mistake. Let me double-check:

Wait, the
