Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Hmm, let me think about what factors influence the transit probability.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. Bigger planet or smaller star means higher chance of blocking our view. But wait, both the planet's size and the star's size matter. Oh right, the probability is proportional to (Rp / R*)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and R* is the star's radius. But wait, I think that's not the exact formula. Or maybe the formula is a bit different.

Wait, no, the transit probability isn't just based on size ratio. Oh, right! The probability of a transit is given by the formula: P = (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (a / (a - d)), where 'a' is the semi-major axis and d is the distance from the star's center to the planet's orbit. Wait, actually, for circular orbits, the probability is (R_planet / R_star)² times ( (a * sin i)/(R_star) ), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - (R_planet / a)^2 )) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's more straightforward.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is mainly determined by the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit.
