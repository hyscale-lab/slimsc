Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values, I think. The phase shifts provided are delta_0 = 90 degrees, delta_1 = 67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, and delta_4=13 degrees. And we're told to ignore the rest. We need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude? Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. The general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^\infty [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ].

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction. When θ is zero, like along the beam direction, what does that do to the formula?

Let me think. When θ approaches zero, the angle between the incident and scattered particles is zero. So for each term in the sum, the sine term becomes sin(l*0 + δ_l) which is sin(δ_l). But wait, the exponential term is e^{i δ_l} which can be written as cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l). Hmm, but wait, wait. The formula is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l). When θ is zero, that becomes (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) ?

Wait, no. Because sin(lθ + δ_l) when θ=0 is sin(δ_l), right. So each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l). So the amplitude f(0) would be (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) for each l.

Wait, but what's e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l)? Let me compute that. e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ. So when you multiply by sin δ, you get:

e^{i δ} sin δ = [cos δ + i sin δ] sin δ = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ.

So the real part is sin δ cos δ, and the imaginary part is sin² δ. So when we sum over all l, the imaginary part of f(0) would be (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

But wait, the question asks specifically for the imaginary part. So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Hmm, but in this case, what is k? Because k is the wave number. Oh right, the electrons are 50 MeV. So I need to calculate k using the relativistic energy.

Wait, the energy is given as 50 MeV. Electrons have rest mass about 0.511 MeV, so this is a high-energy electron. So, the non-relativistic approach might not be accurate, but I think for this problem, they probably expect using the relativistic formula for k.

The formula for the wave number k is k = sqrt( (E^2 - m_e^2 c^4) ) / (ħ c). But let me think again. The relativistic energy of an electron is E = sqrt( (pc c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ). So p is the momentum, and k = p/(ħ).

Wait, perhaps a better approach: The relation between the energy E and the wave number k for a relativistic electron is E = sqrt( (ħ^2 k^2 c^2) + (m_e c^2)^2 ). But wait, since E is given, perhaps I can solve for k.

Alternatively, maybe using the relation E = (ħ c) sqrt(k^2 + (m_e c / ħ)^2 ). Wait, but perhaps I can write k as (E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 )^(1/2) )/( ħ c )

Wait, wait, let me get the formula right. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). p is the momentum, which is ħ k. So E^2 = (ħ k c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So solving for k gives k = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / ( ħ c )

So, let's plug in the numbers. E is 50 MeV
