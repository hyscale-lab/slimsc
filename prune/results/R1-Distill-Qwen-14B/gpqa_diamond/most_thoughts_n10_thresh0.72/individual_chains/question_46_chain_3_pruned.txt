Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these Grubbs catalyst reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis usually refers to the redistribution of alkene bonds. I think Grubbs can cause ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis, but in this case, since we're dealing with a single alkene, maybe it's ring-closing?

Wait, what is the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene? Let me draw that. Pent means five carbons. 1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the pent chain is five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Number the carbons: 1 2 3 4 5. So at position 3, there's a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because if it's pent-1-ene, the double bond is
