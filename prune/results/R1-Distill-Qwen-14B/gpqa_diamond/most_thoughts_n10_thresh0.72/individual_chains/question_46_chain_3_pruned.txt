Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. We need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Specifically, it's a transition metal catalyst that facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds, right? The main process is ring-closing metathesis or ring-opening metathesis, but in this case, I think it’s about cross metathesis or maybe some other kind.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pentene has five carbons. The double bond starts at carbon 1, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-2? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would make it a six-carbon chain. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me recount. 3-methylpent-1-ene: the parent chain is five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, that's five carbons in a row, with a methyl on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but the question says racemic, so it's a racemic mixture. That means the molecule has a chiral center. Let's see, where? So in 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is at 1 and 2. The third carbon is CH(CH3). So the
