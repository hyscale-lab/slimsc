Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me try to think through this.

The problem states that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different formula involving k, q, d, and R.

First, I remember that the potential energy of a system is the work done to bring charges from infinity to their positions. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that probably means it's connected to the Earth, so any induced charges can flow in or out, maintaining an equipotential at the sphere's surface and keeping the potential at zero.

Wait, when you place a charge near a grounded conductor, the conductor will have induced charges. But because it's grounded, the induced charges adjust to ensure the sphere's potential is the same as the ground. So the presence of the charge q will induce opposite charges on the sphere's surface, right?

But wait, since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any excess charge on it can leave, but in this case, the induced charges must be such that the sphere's potential is zero. So the sphere will have induced charges equal and opposite to the image charge in the method of images, perhaps.

I think the method of images is used here. When you have a point charge near a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be modeled by an image charge inside the sphere.

But wait, the sphere is grounded, so maybe I should consider that the induced charges are such that the sphere's net charge is zero? Or does it have a net charge? Hmm, no, because it's grounded, any induced positive and negative charges would adjust to make the potential at the surface zero, but the sphere itself might not have a net charge. Unless the external charge induces a net charge, but since it's grounded, any excess would be neutralized by Earth.

Wait, no. The sphere can have induced charges, but because it's grounded, the charges on the sphere can redistribute as needed. So when a charge q is placed near, the sphere will have induced charges such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. But that doesn't necessarily mean the net charge is zero. Let me think again.

Wait, in the method of images for a conducting sphere, the image charge is placed inside the sphere, and the sphere itself is ungrounded. But in this case, the sphere is grounded. So how does that change things?

When the sphere is grounded, the image charge method might not directly apply because the sphere's potential is fixed at zero (ground potential). So perhaps the image charge approach isn't the same as when the sphere is isolated.

Alternatively, maybe the induced charges on the sphere are such that the external charge and the induced charges produce a potential of zero at the sphere's surface. Since it's grounded, any excess charge beyond what's needed to make the potential zero would flow away.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the potential energy in terms of the work done to bring the charge q to its position and the work done in creating the induced charges on the sphere.

Alternatively, I remember that when a
