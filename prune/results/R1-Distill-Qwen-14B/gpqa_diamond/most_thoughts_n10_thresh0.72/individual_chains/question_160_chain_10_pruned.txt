Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls vertically on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me think it through.

Wait, so when the number of sides N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as N approaches infinity, the shape tends towards a circle. So maybe this problem is similar to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. But wait, no, the question says it's an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal. So each side is the same distance a from the center. That makes me think the polygon is regular, but when N is large, it's almost a circle. So perhaps the problem reduces to finding the minima for a circular aperture?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in the case of a single slit, the diffraction pattern has minima at certain angles, like sin(theta) = mλ/a, where m is an integer. But in a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is more complex, with multiple rings and the first dark ring. But here, the problem says the apothems are all the same. Oh wait, no, the apothems are the same, which in a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So for a regular polygon, all apothems being equal is the case. So when N is large, it approximates a circle with radius a, since the apothem becomes similar to the radius. Or wait, no—actually, for a regular polygon, the radius (distance from center to a vertex) is longer than the apothem. So if all the apothems are the same and N is large, the shape is a circle of radius a?

Wait, I think I need to clarify. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R (distance from center to a vertex) by a = R * cos(π/N), approximately, for large N. So when N approaches infinity, R approaches a / cos(0) = a, since cos(0) is 1. So R ≈ a for
