Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem describes a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group, so -CHO), and a cyano group (which is the nitrile, -CN). These three groups are all meta to one another. So, that means each of them is separated by two carbon atoms in the benzene ring. 

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethyl amino group (which would be -N(CH3)2). Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3). Additionally, both the methoxy and the hydroxyl groups are ortho to the nitrile group. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack, but I'll try to visualize the benzene ring with all these substituents.

I think the best way to approach this is to draw the benzene ring and place each substituent according to the given directions. Let's start by numbering the positions on the benzene ring to make it easier.

The carboxylic acid is one of the substituents. Let's assume that's at position 1. Since the carboxylic acid is a meta-directing group, but wait, actually, when naming the substituents, the numbering is based on which substituent gives the lowest numbers, so the main functional group (like the carboxylic acid) gets the lowest possible number. Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature, the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the COOH group gets the lowest number. So the ring is numbered such that the COOH is at position 1.

So, position 1: COOH.

Now, the carboxylic acid has substituents ortho and para to it. Ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Wait, the question says ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino. So that means positions 2 and 6 have these two groups. But which is which?

Wait, the problem says ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino. So positions 2 and 6 each have one of these groups. But which one is where? Let me think. Also, the para position to COOH (position 4) is a methoxy group.

So position 4: OCH3.

Now, the nitrile (CN) is meta to the carboxylic acid, so that would be either position 3 or 5. Wait, because meta is two positions away. Since position 1 is COOH, the meta positions are 3 and 5. But wait, the problem states that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So, all three are meta, meaning each is two positions apart from each other.

So, COOH is at 1. The carbaldehyde (CHO) is at position 3 or 5. The
