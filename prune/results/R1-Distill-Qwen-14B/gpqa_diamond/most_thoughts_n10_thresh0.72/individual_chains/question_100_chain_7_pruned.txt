Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll think it through.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, the molecular formula for C3H6 could be propene or propyne or maybe even cyclopropane, but the context here might help. The first reaction is bromination in the presence of CCl4. Wait, bromination with CCl4—oh right, that's a typical addition reaction for alkenes. So Compound A must be propene (CH2=CH2CH3) because that would have a double bond which would undergo addition bromination.

So Compound A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3). When it undergoes bromination in CCl4, it probably adds bromine across the double bond. But wait, propene is a three-carbon alkene. Adding bromine would give 1,2-dibromopropane? Or is there a possibility of it being a different product? Oh wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, right? Adding bromine would do an anti-addition, so the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3) or maybe 1-bromo-1-propene? No, no, addition across the double bond, so B would be 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's a dehydrohalogenation, an elimination reaction. So two Br atoms are present, so it would eliminate HBr from adjacent carbons. So the major product would be an alkene. Wait, the structure of B is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when KOH is used, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. Let's see, which positions? The Brs are on C1 and C2. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3?

Wait, the structure of B is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So the first Br is on C1, the second on C2. When KOH removes a hydrogen from C2 or C3. If it's adjacent to either Br, elimination happens. So removing a hydrogen from C2 would form a double bond between C1 and C2. Or from C3 would form between C2 and C3. Wait, but if
