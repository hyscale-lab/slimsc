Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. 

The question is about a proton that's injected into a synchrocyclotron with negligible kinetic energy and goes through two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], with U0 = 190 kV and Φ0 = π/4. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, I remember that in cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons, the particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. The key thing is that the cyclotron frequency is related to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle. But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency changes as the particle's mass increases with velocity? Or is it the magnetic field that changes? Oh right, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the particle's momentum increases. So the frequency isn't constant like in a regular cyclotron.

But how does the acceleration work? The voltage alternates, so the electric field alternates, which changes the kinetic energy of the proton each time it passes through the gap between the D-shaped electrodes. Each time the voltage peaks, the proton gets a kick of energy.

Wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV.
