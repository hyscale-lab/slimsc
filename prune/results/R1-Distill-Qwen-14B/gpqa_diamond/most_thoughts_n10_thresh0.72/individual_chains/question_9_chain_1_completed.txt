Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me think this through.

First, let me remember what C3h symmetry means. C3h is a point group in molecular symmetry. The 'C' stands for cyclic, and the subscript 3 means there are threefold rotation axes. The 'h' indicates that there's a horizontal mirror plane present. So, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation symmetry and also a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which of these molecules has that kind of symmetry.

The options are:
A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I think starting with the more familiar ones might help. Quinuclidine comes to mind. Wait, what's the structure of quinuclidine? It's a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. I think it has a three-membered bridge, which might give it some three-fold symmetry. Wait, no, quinuclidine is actually a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The structure has three bridges, each with two carbons. So, it's a very symmetrical molecule. If I imagine rotating it 120 degrees, does it look the same? Yes, I think it does. Because each bridge is symmetric. So that's the C3 part. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. Quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry that's horizontal, cutting through the middle. So yes, that would make it have C3h symmetry. So D) quinuclidine might be the correct answer.

What about triisopropyl borate? Its structure is a boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a -CH(CH3)2 group. So, the molecule is trigonal planar around boron. Each substituent is the same, so maybe it has a three-fold axis. But does it have a mirror plane? Let me think. If all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, there's a C3 axis. But what about a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not so sure. Triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar, but the plane of the boron's orbit might not have a mirror plane. Wait, maybe the molecule is nonpolar because of symmetry. Wait, but the mirror plane would require a plane that reflects the structure onto itself. Since all substituents are the same, perhaps there's a vertical mirror plane, but I'm not certain about a horizontal one. Hmm, maybe not. So triisopropyl borate might have C3v symmetry, which is a different point group. So it's not C3h.

Now, looking at the other options which are more complex ring structures. Let's consider option B. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So this is a fused ring system. Trifuran implies three furan rings. The numbering suggests how the rings are fused. Hmm, trying to visualize benzo-fused trifuran with substituents. Wait, benzo would add a benzene ring fused to the furans. The positions might be such that there's a three-fold axis. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a six-membered ring with substituents arranged symmetrically. Alternatively, is the molecule symmetric with threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror? I'm not exactly sure about that structure. Maybe it's better to think of each part.

Option A is triphenyleno... something. So, it's a triphenylene group attached to a trifuran. Triphenylene has a symmetric structure, maybe with three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically. If the entire molecule has a three-fold axis, and a mirror plane, then it would fit. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the common compounds. Quinuclidine is known for its high symmetry. From what I remember, quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry (the one that bisects the bridge), and a three-fold rotation axis. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. So it should belong to the C3h group.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is D) quinuclidine.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the options based on the definition of **C₃h** symmetry. This point group requires the molecule to have a threefold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (h) that reflects the molecule onto itself.

### Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is a complex fused ring system with a triphenylene group attached to a trifuran. While the triphenylene portion is symmetric, the overall structure does not clearly exhibit a threefold rotational axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is another fused ring system with a benzo group attached to a trifuran. The arrangement of the fused rings and substituents does not provide a clear threefold rotational axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: triisopropyl borate  
This molecule consists of a boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups, giving it trigonal planar geometry. While it has a threefold rotational axis (C₃), it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (h). Thus, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a highly symmetric structure. It has a threefold rotational axis (C₃) due to the symmetry of its three equivalent bridges. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane that reflects the molecule onto itself. This combination of symmetry elements makes quinuclidine the correct choice for having **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
The molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry is **quinuclidine**.

Answer: D
