Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). Hmm, so I need to find the energy spectrum, which means I need to find the possible energy levels E.

Wait, quantum mechanics in two dimensions. I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially in bound systems like the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers and the potential's form. So this potential looks like a combination of terms. Let me break it down.

The potential V(r, θ) has two parts: the first is (1/2)kr², which is the standard form for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). Hmm, cos²(theta) can be expressed using a double-angle identity. I think cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So maybe splitting that term would help.

Let me rewrite the second term: (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. That becomes (3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. So the entire potential V(r,θ) becomes (1/2 kr² + 3/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ).

Wait, adding those terms: (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4) kr², so V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. Hmm, maybe I can factor out kr²? So it's kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ]. But wait, perhaps I should think in terms of angular dependence and radial dependence.

In two dimensions, the solution usually involves expressing the wavefunction in polar coordinates. The radial part and the angular part are separated. For the potential given, the angular part has a cos2θ term. So maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of angular momentum operators or something
