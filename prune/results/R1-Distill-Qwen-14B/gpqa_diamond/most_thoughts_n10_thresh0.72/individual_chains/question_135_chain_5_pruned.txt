Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that again. Oh, right, the standard form for such interactions is usually something like L = λ X ψ ψ, so this looks like X is interacting with fermions by coupling to their fields. So, the term would mediate interactions where the boson X is exchanged between two fermions.

But the main question is about the allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

Hmm, for a boson decay into a pair of fermions, the key thing is the energy/momentum conservation and the mass of the boson. Also, the fermions must be able to be produced, meaning their rest masses must be less than or equal to half the mass of X. Wait, no, because in a decay, each fermion's rest mass must be less than the mass of the boson. But wait, for a boson at rest decaying into two particles, each particle's energy must be at least their rest mass. So the combined rest mass of the two particles must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Oh wait, no, each particle's mass must be less than X's mass because each comes out with some momentum but their energies are each at least their rest mass. So for a decay X → f f-bar, each f must have a mass less than or equal to M_X/2. Because if each has mass m_f, then 2m_f ≤ M_X. So, M_X ≥ 2m_f.

Wait, wait, because each fermion must have energy at least m_f, so the sum of their energies would be at least 2m_f. But since the boson is at rest, the total energy is just M_X. So 2m_f ≤ M_X → m_f ≤
