Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The problem states that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the only differences between the two planets are the RV shifts observed: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, what's a milliangstrom? Oh right, 1 milliangstrom is 1e-3 angstroms. But I guess the actual value doesn't matter as much as the ratio between them.

I remember that the RV semi-amplitude (the maximum velocity) is given by a formula. Let me think. Oh, right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 AU)^2 * (1 year)^3 ) )) Wait, no, maybe I should look it up in terms of the planet's velocity or the star's velocity.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (P) * ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )) ) Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, maybe the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)), but wait, that might not be exactly right. Or is it K proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (sqrt(P)))?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Kepler's third law. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have the same mass, but different RV shifts. The RV shift is related to the planet's mass and the distance from the star. Because the RV method measures the star's velocity wobble, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital distance.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / (c * sqrt(1 - e²))) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me see. Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K relates to the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a.

Kepler's third law says (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star
