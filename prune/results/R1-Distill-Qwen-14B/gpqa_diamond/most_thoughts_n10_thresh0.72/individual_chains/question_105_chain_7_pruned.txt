Hmm, okay, so I've got an astronomy problem here about stars with spots and exoplanets. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. They say that photometric observations show brightness variations because the star rotates and the spots come into view, which is similar to how an exoplanet transiting a star would cause a dip in brightness. But the question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do?

Wait, so the scenario is that the star's brightness variation due to these spots is being mistaken for an exoplanet transit. And we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same change in brightness, assuming there were no spots.

I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the planet blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, the star has spots, so the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us, the total light we receive is less. So the variation in brightness is due to the spots rotating into and out of view.

So first, I need to figure out the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the amplitude that a planet would cause, and find the ratio R_planet / R_star.

Let's break it down step by step.

The star's total flux without spots would be based on its effective temperature. But since a part of its surface (the spots) is cooler, the total flux is a bit less than the full flux.

Wait, the effective temperature is the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same total radiation as the star. So the star emits as a blackbody with T_eff = 6000 K.

The spots are at 5000 K (since they are 1000 K cooler). The filling factor is 20%, meaning 20% of the surface area is covered by spots. But wait, the spots are only covering one hemisphere. Hmm, the question says one hemisphere is covered, but the filling factor is 20%. So the filling factor is 0.2, but since it's one hemisphere, maybe the area is 0.2*(surface area of a hemisphere). Or perhaps the total area of spots is 0.2 times the total surface area of the star? Let me think.

Wait, no. The filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the total surface area covered. So if the star has a radius R, the surface area is 4πR². If the spots cover 20% of that, then the area is 0.2 * 4πR².

Wait, but the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So perhaps the spots cover 20% of the area of one hemisphere. Because a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So if the total surface area is 4πR², a hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of that would be 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total area of the spots is 0.4πR².

Wait, but maybe that's not the right way. The problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So the area covered is 0.2 * (2πR²), which is 0.4πR².

Each spot has a lower temperature, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing the observed flux to dip.

The way the brightness variation works is that without any spots, the star would have a certain flux
