Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, annihilation usually involves matter and antimatter particles annihilating each other and producing other particles. So, in this case, a proton and an antiproton are annihilating into two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles.

Wait, since it's a reaction between a proton and an antiproton, their rest masses are significant. The proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², same as the antiproton because it's just the opposite. So the initial energy comes from their rest mass plus any kinetic energy, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass. Or maybe not—wait, the problem says it's moving slowly, so perhaps it's non-relativistic? But in particle physics, even slow particles can have significant energies. Hmm, not sure yet.

But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps its velocity is much less than the speed of light, making it non-relativistic. But in that case, the total energy would be the rest energy plus (1/2)mv². Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe we need to consider relativistic energy.

Wait, but the problem gives us m_A c² = 300 MeV. So each A particle has a rest energy of 300 MeV. So the total rest energy of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, since there are four A particles (two plus and two minus, so four in total). 

But wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², same for the antiproton. So in their rest frame, their combined rest energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. But when they annihilate, they produce four particles each with 300 MeV rest energy. So the
