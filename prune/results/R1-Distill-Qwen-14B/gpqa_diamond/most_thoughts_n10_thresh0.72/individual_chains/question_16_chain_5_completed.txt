Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Optical activity means that a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a compound has chiral centers. So I need to check each of these compounds for chiral centers or any other factors that cause optical activity.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, this is a butene with substituents on the double bond. Wait, the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Oh wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl attached to C1, then a methyl on C2. Wait, but if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then for (Z) configuration, the substituents on each end would be on the same side.

But does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is Cl attached to C1 (since it's 1-chloro), and C1 is double-bonded to C2. So C1 is bonded to Cl, two H's, and double bond. So, C1 isn't a chiral center because it's double-bonded and hence not a tetrahedral carbon. So no chiral centers here. Does this molecule have any other sources of asymmetry? Maybe if it's a meso compound? Wait, but for that, there need to be multiple stereocenters and a plane of symmetry. I don't think this molecule has any stereocenters, so no optical activity. So this compound is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
Wait, that's a mouthful. Okay, so it's a bicyclic compound, probably with a fused ring system. The substituents are a chloromethylene group (CH2Cl) attached in position 8. The (3aR,7aS) indicates that two of the bridgehead carbons have specific configurations.

Now, bridgehead carbons can sometimes be chiral centers if they have four different substituents. So let's imagine the structure. There's a bridged bicyclic system, where the bridgehead carbons are 3a and 7a. If each has four different groups, they would be chiral. Wait, but in some bicyclic systems, like norbornane, the bridgehead carbons can't be chiral due to Bredt's rule. But wait, Bredt's rule mainly applies to double bonds in bridged systems. Hmm, but for chiral centers, if the bridgehead carbon has four different substituents, it can be chiral.

So for (3aR,7aS), each of these bridgehead carbons would have four distinct groups. So each bridgehead is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral overall. Also, the E configuration refers to the substituents around the double bond, but that doesn't affect optical activity directly unless it's part of a stereocenter. So this compound probably has chiral centers, so it's optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The substituents here are methyl groups on C2 and C3. So the structure would be HOOC-C(R)-CH(S)-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Let me draw it:

The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, the molecule is 2 and 3 dimethyl succinic acid. So the two CH2 groups in succinic acid each have a methyl. So positions 2 and 3 each have a CH3.

So the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, are there any chiral centers here? Let's see. The second carbon (C2) is attached to: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and another CH(CH3). Wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Replacing each CH2 with CH(CH3) would make C2 and C3 each have four substituents?

Wait, no. For a chiral center, each carbon must have four different groups. So C2 is connected to: HOOC- (from C1), two CH(CH3) groups (since C2 and C3 are each CH(CH3)), and a CH3. Wait, no. Let me think.

Actually, the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So the second carbon (C2) is connected to:
- The first carbon (C1, which is -CH2-COOH if it's succinic acid, but now it's CH(CH3)).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me break it down.

The molecule is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So the structure is:

Carbons 1: COOH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH? No, wait, succinic acid is four carbons: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when we substitute CH2 with CH(CH3) at positions 2 and 3, the structure becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, because 2 and 3 are each CH(CH3).

Wait, but wait, each of those carbons (C2 and C3) would have:

C2: attached to COOH (from C1), two CH(CH3) groups (since C2 is connected to C1 and C3), and a methyl group? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle two carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group. Let's check if C2 is a chiral center.

For C2: the substituents are:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (C3)
- CH3 (the methyl group)
- and another substituent. Wait, wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the C2 is connected to:

- C1: which is CH(CH3) (since C1 is CH2 in succinic acid, but now it's CH(CH3)? No, wait, no. The first carbon is the carboxylic acid. So C1 is the COOH, then C2 is the next carbon.

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled. Let's consider the structure of succinic acid: it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So C2 is CH2 and C3 is CH2.

In 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, C2 and C3 each have a methyl group. So C2 becomes CH(CH3), and C3 becomes CH(CH3). So structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, for each of C2 and C3: what are their four substituents?

C2:

- attached to COOH (from C1)
- a methyl group (CH3)
- two CH(CH3) groups (from C3 and another? No, wait. No, each CH(CH3) is only attached to C2 and C3. Wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 and C3. So for C2:

Groups are:

- C1: which is a CH2-COOH (no, wait, no. C1 is the COOH group, so the next carbon is C2. In succinic acid, it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So in this case, C2 is CH(CH3) and C3 is CH(CH3).

So for C2:

- One substituent is the COOH group (OOC-HO-CH2-...)
Wait, the substituents on C2 are:

- The COOH group (on C1)
- Another CH(CH3) group (on C3)
- Two CH3 groups? No, wait. No, C2 is CH(CH3)-. So on C2, the four substituents would be:

- The C1 (which is -COOH)
- The C3 (which is CH(CH3)-...)
- Two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. No, wait, the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle two carbons (C2 and C3) has the following:

C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two more CH3 groups? Or wait, maybe it's:

C2 has groups: COOH (from C1, which is a CH2 group in the original structure), but now C2 is CH(CH3), so the substituents are:

- COO- (from C1, but actually, the substituent is a CH2-COOH group, but wait, no, C1 is the COOH, so the substituent is the rest of the chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each carbon's substituents.

At C2:

- One substituent: the -COOH group (from C1)
Wait, no. The chain is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have:

C2:

- Connected to C1: which is a -COOH group attached to a CH2 (but wait, in this case, C1 is the first carbon, which is the COOH, so C2 is connected to that CH2 group? No, wait, in the structure, the four carbons are arranged as C1, C2, C3, C4. C1 is COOH, C2 is CH(CH3), C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is COOH.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, so the four carbons are COOH, CH2, CH2, COOH. So when you add a methyl to C2 and C3, they become CH(CH3).

So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). So each of these carbons has four substituents: the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3 for C2; C2 and C4 for C3?), but wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 (which is CH2-COOH), and to C3 (CH(CH3)), and has two CH3 groups?

Wait, no, the substituents for C2 would be:

- COOH (from C1, but C1 is actually the COOH group. So C2 is connected to C1, which is a CH2 group attached to COOH.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents on C2. For C2:

- It is attached to C1 (which is a CH2 from the succinic acid, but now it's a CH(CH3)), wait no.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- The two adjacent CH2 groups (C1 and C3)
- Two methyl groups.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should just think about whether this compound has a plane of symmetry.

If the substituents on C2 and C3 are mirror images, perhaps the molecule is meso. Because if the configurations are R and S, but arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral.

Wait, but the question says (2R,3S). So let's imagine C2 is R configuration, C3 is S.

So, what's the structure?

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Are C2 and C3 each chiral centers?

For C2: substituents are:

- The COOH group (on C1, which is CH2)
- The CH(CH3) on C3
- Two CH3 groups?

Wait, no, because each CH(CH3) has three substituents. Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) is connected to C1, C3, and two CH3 groups?

Wait, no, the structure is:

C1: COOH
C2: CH(CH3)
C3: CH(CH3)
C4: COOH

So C2 is attached to C1 (which is a CH2- group), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups.

Wait, so for C2:

Groups: CH2-COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), two CH3 groups.

Wait, that can't be, because CH(CH3) would have three substituents: two CH3 and one other?

No, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Each C2 has:

- One substituent from C1: which is a CH2 group attached to COOH (so it's a CH2-COOH)
- One substituent from C3: which is a CH(CH3), so a CH(CH3) group
- Two CH3 groups attached to C2 itself.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if C2 is CH(CH3), it's attached to three groups: C1, C3, and a CH3.

Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons has a methyl group. So for each middle carbon:

C2: connected to:

- C1 (CH2-COOH)
- C3 (CH(CH3))
- A methyl (CH3)
- And what else? Wait, that’s three substituents. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each middle carbon (C2 and C3) is CH(CH3). So for C2:

- The substituents are: C1 (CH2-COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), two CH3 groups.

Wait, but that would make four substituents. So C2 is connected to:

1. C1 (CH2)
2. C3 (CH)
3. CH3
4. Another CH3?

Wait no, that would be four substituents. So C2 has:

- CH2-COOH (group from C1)
- CH(CH3) (group from C3)
- Two CH3 groups attached to C2.

Wait, that's four substituents. So the four substituents would be:

- CH2-COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- CH3,
- another CH3.

But wait, if two substituents are CH3, then C2 would have two identical groups, making it not a chiral center. Because for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different.

Wait, in C2:

Groups are:

1. CH2-COOH (from C1)
2. CH(CH3) (from C3)
3. CH3
4. CH3.

So two of the substituents are the same (CH3). Therefore, C2 is not a chiral center because it has duplicate substituents. Similarly, C3 would have:

- CH(CH3) from C2,
- CH2-COOH from C4,
- two CH3 groups.

So same situation: two CH3 substituents, so not a chiral center. Then, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. Wait, but wait, the question says (2R,3S), so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. If both C2 and C3 have two CH3 groups, then they can't be chiral centers. So the entire molecule would not have any chiral centers, hence no optical activity. So this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps the substituents are different. Let's think again. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to two CH3 groups, a CH2-COOH, and a CH(CH3). So for C2:

Substituents are:

- CH2-COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- CH3 (on C2)
- Another CH3 (on C2)

So two CH3 groups, so same substituent. So no chiral center. So the molecule is not chiral, hence no optical activity. So this compound is not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
This is similar to the previous one but with both R configurations.

Wait, same structure as the previous: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the analysis is the same. Each of the C2 and C3 carbons has two CH3 groups, so no chiral centers. So no optical activity.

Wait, but wait a minute. Maybe the configuration affects something else? No, because regardless of the configuration, if the substituents are the same, it's not a chiral center. So this compound is also not optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
Alright, this is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, the structure is a cyclohexene (six-membered ring with a double bond). The OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, does this create a chiral center? Let's see: C1 has OH, and the ring would have adjacent substituents.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an OH at position 1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

So, looking at C1: what are the substituents?

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (adjacent carbons)
- And the double bond would be across the ring.

Wait, the ring structure: C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and has the OH group. The double bond is between C3 and C4.

So for C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- The double bond between C3 and C4, but wait, that's part of the ring structure. So C1 is attached to C2 and C6, which are both CH2 groups (since the ring is cyclohexene, which has two double bonds? No, wait, cyclohexene has one double bond, so only one double bond in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the ring has a chair conformation or something else. Anyway, the main thing is whether C1 is a chiral center.

C1 has four substituents:

1. OH group.
2. The ring, which is connected to C2 (CH2), C6 (CH2), and the double bond. Hmm, but in a ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two other substituents. So for C1, the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6)
- And the double bond (as part of the ring structure, but that's a ring substituent, not a substituent in the same way as the OH and CH2 groups.

Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring has two ring bonds (to C2 and C6), an OH group (on C1), and a hydrogen? No, because the ring is cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about whether the carbon with the OH is a chiral center. For that, it must have four different substituents.

At C1:

- OH group
- Two ring bonds to C2 and C6 (but in a ring, these are the same as adjacent CH2 groups)
- The double bond is part of the ring, so maybe the substituents are as follows:

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- C2 (which is CH2)
- C6 (which is CH2)
- The double bond, which would create a trans or cis arrangement.

Wait, no, the double bond is part of the ring between C3 and C4, so it's not directly connected to C1. So substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- The ring (but that's more about the structure than substituents).

Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two other substituents. For C1 in this case, the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2 (to C2)
- CH2 (to C6)
- And maybe a hydrogen?

Wait, no, because in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent ring carbons and two other substituents. For C1:

- It's bonded to C2 and C6 (each a CH2 group)
- It has an OH group
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups, and a H. So substituents are:

1. OH
2. CH2- (C2)
3. CH2- (C6)
4. H

Wait, but the two CH2 groups are the same (since they're both just CH2), so substituents would be OH, H, and two identical CH2 groups. Thus, C1 would not be a chiral center because two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups are identical), so there's no four different substituents.

Wait, but wait, the ring structure could make the substituents different. For example, the positions of the substituents around the ring might cause the substituents to be in different environments, but in terms of actual substituent groups, if they're both CH2, they're the same.

So in this case, C1 would have two CH2 groups, making it not a chiral center. Therefore, the compound wouldn't be optically active. But wait, the (R) designation is given. How can that be if C1 isn't a chiral center?

Ah, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe C1 is a chiral center. Let me think again. If C1 has four different substituents, then it would be chiral.

Wait, so substituents on C1:

- OH
- CH2-C2 (which is connected to C3)
- CH2-C6 (connected to C5)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but the CH2 groups connected to C2 and C6 are each part of the same ring. Are the substituents from C2 and C6 different?

Wait, if the ring is such that C2 is adjacent to C3 (which is part of the double bond), and C6 is adjacent to C5 (which is a CH2), then the substituents on C1 may be different. Because the substituents on C2 and C6 might be in different environments.

So for C1:

- The substituents are:

1. OH
2. CH2-C2 (which is connected to a double bond)
3. CH2-C6 (which is connected to a single bond)
4. H

So in this case, the two CH2 groups are attached to different environments. Would that make them different substituents?

Hmm, in the case of cyclohexane derivatives, the substituents can be considered different if their positions affect the structure. So for C1:

- The substituent towards C2 is adjacent to a double bond (between C3 and C4), making it a different environment than the substituent towards C6, which is adjacent to a single bond (between C5 and C6).

So in this case, the two CH2 substituents on C1 are in different environments, making them different groups. Therefore, C1 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So the (R) configuration indicates that the compound has optical activity.

So this compound is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: three OH groups at positions 1,3,5. So the molecule is symmetric: the substituents are at alternating positions, which might give it a plane of symmetry.

So the question is, is this molecule chiral? If it has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral, even if individual centers are chiral.

Wait, in this case, each OH is on alternating carbons, which may create a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are all in the same configuration (like all R or all S), then the molecule might be meso.

Wait, but let me think about the actual structure. If the substituents are in positions 1,3,5, and each has the same configuration (s), does that make the molecule achiral?

Alternatively, if there's a plane of symmetry, the molecule would be achiral. For example, if you can draw a plane that makes each substituent a mirror image of another, then the molecule is meso.

In this case, the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions. Let's imagine the ring: positions 1, 3, and 5 are all OH groups. If all are in the same configuration (say, all R), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, for example, if you have a chair conformation, and the OH groups are axial or equatorial. But without specific information, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and hence not optically active.

Alternatively, if the substituents create a chiral environment, the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the number of chiral centers. Each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) could be chiral centers if they have four different substituents.

So for C1:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (adjacent carbons)
- And another substituent, which is the ring.

Wait, the ring substituents are: C1 is connected to C2 and C6. Each of those is a CH2 group (since the other positions are 3 and 5, which have OH groups).

Wait, but for C1, substituents are:

- OH
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, each carbon connected to two others and two Hs. But in this case, each of C1, C3, C5 has an OH group.

So for C1, substituents would be:

- OH
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- H (if any)

Wait, but in reality, each carbon in cyclohexane has two CH2 groups (adjacent carbons) and two Hs. But when you add an OH group, one of the Hs is replaced.

So C1 would have:

- OH
- C2 (CH2)
- C6 (CH2)
- H

So substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and H. The two CH2 groups are the same, so C1 is not a chiral center. Similarly, C3 and C5 would have the same setup.

Wait, so each OH-bearing carbon isn't a chiral center because two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups). So the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it's not optically active.

Wait, but wait. If the OH groups are on 1,3,5 positions, and all are in the same configuration, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So even if each OH is on a CH group, if the overall molecule is symmetric, it would be achiral.

So yes, this compound is not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
The structure is a butanone (four carbons, ketone on C1) with a cyclopentyl group on C1 and a methyl group on C3.

So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but more accurately, it's (cyclopentyl)butanone with substituents.

Wait, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

Butan-1-one means the ketone is on C1. So structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2?

Wait, but butanone has four carbons. So butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But here, the first carbon (C1) has a cyclopentyl group and a ketone.

So the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain with substituents on C1 and C3.

Wait, let me think. Butan-1-one is O=C-R, where R is a three-carbon chain. In this case, R is cyclopentyl, CH2, CH(CH3), CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, but butanone is four carbons. Oh, wait, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have the structure:

O=C-R where R is a cyclopentyl group; the butanone chain is:

O=C-R-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be pentanone.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me count the carbons.

Butan-1-one is four carbons: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO, but no, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, butan-1-one is (R)COCH2CH2CH3? No, butanone is (R)COCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's pentanone. Wait, butanone is four carbons in total, so it's O=C-CH2CH2CH2-.

Wait, no, butanone is O=C followed by three more carbons (since butan has four). So it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But in this case, the substituents are on C1 and C3.

Wait, but 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but that makes the structure O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that's five carbons? Or wait, the butanone has four carbons including the ketone.

So the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but that seems to have more than four carbons. Maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The ketone is on C1 (O=C-), then C2 is a cyclopentyl group, C3 is CH2, C4 is CH(CH3), and C5 is CH3. But that would be pentanone, not butanone.

Hmm. Maybe I should think differently. The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the parent chain is butan-1-one: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So substituents are on C1 (cyclopentyl) and C3 (methyl).

So the structure would be:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the butanone has the cyclopentyl on C1 and the methyl on C3.

In any case, the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Looking for a carbon with four different substituents.

The ketone carbon (C1) is O=C, so no. C2 is connected to the cyclopentyl and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps:

Wait, the structure is:

O=C-R, where R is cyclopentyl, then a CH2 group, then CH(CH3), then CH3.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

The ketone is on C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about possible chiral centers.

The ketone (C1) is not a chiral center. C2: let's say it's connected to the cyclopentyl group, and two CH2 groups. So substituents on C2 would be:

- cyclopentyl
- two CH2 groups
- and the next group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- cyclopentyl
- CH2-CH(CH3)
- CH2-CH2
- and a hydrogen? No, that might not be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a chiral center somewhere else.

Looking for any carbon with four different substituents.

C3: if the structure is O=C-R-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, then C3 would be CH(CH3), connected to:

- CH2 from C2
- CH2 from C4
- two CH3 groups?

Wait, if C3 is CH(CH3), then it's connected to:

- C2 (CH2)
- C4 (CH2)
- two CH3 groups.

So substituents are CH2, CH2, CH3, CH3. So two CH2 and two CH3, so no chiral center.

Wait, maybe another carbon is a chiral center.

C4: perhaps, in the structure, C4 is CH2 connected to C3 and C5.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Wait, but wait, the substituents could be arranged in such a way that a chiral center exists.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is attached to a carbon that's a chiral center.

Wait, the cyclopentyl is attached to C2, which is adjacent to the ketone. So C2's substituents are:

- O=C-R (from C1)
- cyclopentyl
- two CH2 groups.

If C2 has two identical substituents (like two CH2 groups), then it's not a chiral center. Alternatively, if C2 has four different substituents, it would be.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- O=C-R (from C1)
- cyclopentyl
- CH2-CH(CH3)
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Without a clear structure, it's hard to say, but perhaps there's a chiral center in this molecule.

Wait, another approach: the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it could be achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are all on the same side, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm going to guess that this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. But I'm not entirely confident.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which is required for a compound to be optically active. A chiral compound has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or another form of asymmetry. Below is the analysis for each compound:

---

### 1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
- The structure is **Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2**.
- The carbon at position 1 is double-bonded to C2, making it sp² hybridized and not a chiral center.
- None of the carbons in this molecule are chiral centers.
- **Not optically active.**

---

### 2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
- This is a bicyclic compound with a chloromethylene group (CH2Cl) attached at position 8.
- The bridgehead carbons at positions 3a and 7a are chiral centers because they each have four different substituents.
- The molecule has chirality due to these chiral centers.
- **Optically active.**

---

### 3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
- The structure is **HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH**.
- The carbons at positions 2 and 3 are each bonded to a methyl group, a carboxylic acid group, and two identical CH(CH3) groups.
- Since the substituents on C2 and C3 are not all different, these carbons are not chiral centers.
- **Not optically active.**

---

### 4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
- The structure is the same as in compound 3: **HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH**.
- The analysis is identical to compound 3. The carbons at positions 2 and 3 are not chiral centers.
- **Not optically active.**

---

### 5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
- The structure is a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group at position 1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.
- The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: OH, two CH2 groups (in different environments due to the double bond), and a hydrogen.
- The (R) configuration confirms the presence of chirality.
- **Optically active.**

---

### 6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
- This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.
- Each carbon at positions 1, 3, and 5 is bonded to two identical CH2 groups, making them not chiral centers.
- The molecule lacks chirality and is achiral due to its symmetry.
- **Not optically active.**

---

### 7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
- The structure is **O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2**.
- The ketone carbon (C1) is not a chiral center because it is double-bonded to oxygen.
- The other carbons in the molecule do not have four different substituents.
- **Not optically active.**

---

### Conclusion:
Out of the seven compounds, only **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione** and **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol** exhibit optical activity.
