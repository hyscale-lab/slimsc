Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question gives me the IR data and the 1H NMR. Let's start with the IR. The strong bands around 3400 cm-1 probably indicate N-H or O-H stretches. Wait, the peaks are at 3420 and 3325. Those are broad or sharp? Well, if it's a broad peak, it's likely O-H, but if it's sharp, maybe N-H. But here, it's two medium to strong bands. That's a bit confusing. Also, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's usually a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe an amide or ester.

Now looking at the NMR data. Let me jot down the peaks:

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH3 group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group. Because in ethyl groups, the CH3 is a triplet when next to a CH2. So maybe an ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an amine or something exchanging. 2H could be adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like maybe an OCH2 or NCH2. Wait, but in the IR, we saw something about N-H. If it's a singlet and broad, maybe it's an NH group. But wait, in that case, the chemical shift is 4.0, which is a bit upfield for NH. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2â€”like if it's an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be around 4.0. But then why is it a singlet?

4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H, probably a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl ester. The quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so maybe the CH2 in the middle of an ethoxy group. Wait, normal ethoxy groups have triplet at 1.2 (the CH3) and quartet at 4
