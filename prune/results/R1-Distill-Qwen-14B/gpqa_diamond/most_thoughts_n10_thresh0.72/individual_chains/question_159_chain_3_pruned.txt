Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and the universe's comoving distance. Hmm, let's start by understanding what's being asked. The question is about observations of a quasar's spectrum, specifically in the near infrared and optical ranges. There's a peak at around 790 nm, and the flux drops below that wavelength. 

Wait, I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad or narrow. But how does that relate to the redshift? Oh right, the peak's wavelength can be compared to the rest wavelength to find the redshift. So if the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted (rest) wavelength, that means redshift.

Wait, so what's the rest wavelength of that emission? Oh, I think the peak here is in the near-infrared, which is around 790 nm. But wait, I thought the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 120 nm in the ultraviolet. Or maybe that's the Balmer series... I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, quasars often show broad emission lines in optical and near-IR. Maybe this peak is part of the Lyman-alpha forest or something else.

Wait, maybe the peak corresponds to a specific emission line. Let me thinkâ€”hydrogen emission lines: Lyman alpha is
