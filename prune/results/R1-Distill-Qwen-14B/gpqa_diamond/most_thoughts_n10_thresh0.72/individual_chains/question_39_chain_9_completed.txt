Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. It's about wave functions and normalization. I remember that wave functions need to be normalized so that the total probability is 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

The problem states that each particle's wave function is given by (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this region, but within x=1 to x=3, it's given by that expression.

Wait, no, actually the wave function is given as that expression in the region where the particles can exist. Oh wait, the question says "in a part of space where it can exist". So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere. So our integration for normalization will be from x=1 to x=3.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. No, wait, that's not right. Wait, the function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by 1 minus 0.5i? Or is it (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus (0.5i)? I think it's the former because the way it's written is (a / sqrt(...)) - 0.5i. But wait, no, because the entire expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So ψ(x) is a complex function.

So to find the normalization constant 'a', I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

First, let's write ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. To compute |ψ|², I need to find the complex conjugate and multiply.

The complex conjugate of ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i, because the imaginary part changes sign.

So |ψ|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] * [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ].

Multiplying these two terms: (a^2)/(1+x) + (a * 0.5i)/(sqrt(1+x)) - (a * 0.5i)/(sqrt(1+x)) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me compute it properly.

The product is (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 (because (i)(-i) is 1). The cross terms: [a*0.5i/sqrt(1+x)] *1 and the other term is negative because (-0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) = -0.5ai/sqrt(1+x), and when multiplied by the first term's second factor, wait no, maybe I should do it more cleanly.

Actually, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Wait, no, wait, (a - c)(a + c) = a² - c². But in this case, the terms aren't exactly a and c, but here, ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i), so the conjugate is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i). So when we multiply them, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5i)^2*(-1). Wait, no, wait: (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So here, a is a/sqrt(1+x), and b is 0.5i. So |ψ|² is (a²)/(1+x) - (0.5i)^2.

But (0.5i)^2 is (0.25)(i^2) = (0.25)(-1) = -0.25. So the entire expression becomes (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral becomes the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx.

Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Let me recheck. Because ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. When you take the product ψ*(x) ψ(x), you get (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, because (i)(-i) is 1. Let me double-check:

ψ(x) = A + B, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = -0.5i.

ψ*(x) = A - B (since the imaginary part flips sign).

So ψ*(x) ψ(x) = (A - B)(A + B) = A² - B².

So A² is (a²)/(1+x), and B is 0.5i, so B² is (0.5i)^2 = -0.25.

So |ψ|² = A² - B² = (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) ) = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral is ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from x=1 to x=3.

So the integral will be a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 plus 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each part.

First, ∫1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

At x=3: ln(4), at x=1: ln(2). So the integral is ln(4) - ln(2) )= ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term becomes a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) =0.25 * 2= 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5.

We set this equal to 1:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute a²: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

So a² ≈ 0.7202 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. But wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute 0.5/ln(2):

ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.7202.

sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So the closest option is B) 0.85.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of |ψ|²? Let me re-express ψ(x):

ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i.

So ψ*(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] + 0.5i.

Then ψ*(x)ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + [a / sqrt(1+x)]*(0.5i) + [a / sqrt(1+x)]*(-0.5i).

Wait, no, that's the expansion of (a - b)(a + b) where b is 0.5i. So it's a² + (b² with a negative sign? No, wait no, (a - b)(a + b) = a² + ab - ab + b²? No, wait, that's not right. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, (a - b)(a + b) = a² + a b - a b - b² → a² - b².

So in our case, a is [a / sqrt(1+x)] and b is 0.5i.

So ψ*(x)ψ(x) = (a²)/(1+x) - (0.5i)^2.

But (0.5i)^2 = (0.5)^2 (i^2) = 0.25 * (-1) = -0.25.

So the expression becomes (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) → (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Yes, so that part is correct.

So the integral of |ψ|² is [a² ln(2)] + [0.25*(3-1)] → a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Set equal to 1: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln 2 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485, which is about 0.85, so option B.

But wait, let me think again. Did I consider the 1/x function correctly? Because 1/(1+x) integrated from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2), which is correct.

Another check: let's compute the integral.

Wait, the wave function is given in the part where x is between 1 and 3. The rest is zero. So the normalization is only over that interval.

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems correct, leading to a ≈ 0.8485, so the best option is B) 0.85.


To determine the normalization constant \( a \), we start by ensuring the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) is normalized. The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The wave function is complex, so \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x)\psi(x) \). The complex conjugate of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
\psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i
\]

Multiplying \( \psi(x) \) and \( \psi^*(x) \):

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 - (0.5i)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This splits into two terms:

1. \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \)
2. \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \)

For the first term, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \) evaluated from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

For the second term:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest option to \( a \approx 0.8485 \) is \( 0.85 \), corresponding to option B.

Answer: B
