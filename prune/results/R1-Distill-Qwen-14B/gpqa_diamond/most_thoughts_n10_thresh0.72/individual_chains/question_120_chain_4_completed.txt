Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star moves relative to more distant background stars when observed from Earth as it orbits the Sun. The formula for parallax (plx) is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. Oh right, so parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The bigger the parallax, the closer the star is to us.

Now the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what way? I think it means that the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So the number of stars in a given volume doesn't depend on where you look, just on the size of the volume.

Wait, but how does that translate into the number of stars per unit parallax? Parallax is a function of distance. So maybe we can think in terms of how many stars fall into a certain range of parallax values.

Let me get this straight. We're looking for N(>plx), the number of stars with parallax greater than a certain value. Alternatively, maybe it's the number per unit plx. Wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx." So, for each small change in plx, how many stars are there in that range.

So, considering that stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (n) is constant. Let's say n stars per cubic parsec.

Parallax plx is 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So a small change in plx, d(plx) = - (1/d²) dd. Wait, because plx = 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) d d. So d d = -d² d plx. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the signs, but perhaps for small changes, we can take the absolute value.

So if we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding range in distance is from d to d + dd, where dd is small. Or wait, if plx increases, d decreases, right? Because plx is inversely proportional to d.

But since plx is 1/d, then as plx increases, d decreases. So a unit increase in plx (like moving from plx to plx + dplx) would correspond to a decrease in d. But I'm more interested in the number of stars in that range of plx.

Wait, number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dd is 4π d² n dd. Because the volume is the surface area (4π d²) times the thickness (dd), and multiplied by the number density n.

But since we're considering the number per unit plx, perhaps we can express this in terms of plx.

Given that plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substituting d into the expression:

Number of stars in distance shell: N = 4π d² n dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 n (dd).

But dd is related to d plx. From plx = 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dd ⇒ dd = -d² d plx. Since plx is positive, and d is positive, but dd is negative when plx increases (because as you go to larger plx, d decreases). So taking absolute values, perhaps, since we're dealing with a small positive change in plx, the corresponding dd is negative, but the magnitude is d² d plx.

Wait, let me clarify. If plx increases by d plx, then d decreases by (since d = 1/plx):

d d = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So the change in d is negative when plx increases. So the thickness of the shell in d is |dd| = (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the number of stars per unit plx. So perhaps I can rearrange the expression for N in terms of plx.

N = 4π (1/plx)^2 n * (1/plx^2) d plx.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me go back. The number of stars in that thin shell is N = 4π d² n * dd. But dd is related to d plx.

So let's express dd in terms of d plx. From d plx = - (1/d²) dd, so dd = -d² d plx.

So N = 4π d² n * (-d² d plx). But we can ignore the negative sign because we're considering a small positive change in plx, so the absolute value would be:

N = 4π d² n * (d² d plx) = 4π d^4 n d plx.

But d is 1/plx, so substituting:

N = 4π (1/plx)^4 n * d plx.

Which is 4π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is N per d plx = 4π n (1/plx^4).

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So for a small change in plx (d plx), the number of stars in that range is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, no. Wait, because I think I might have misapplied the variables. Let's think about it in terms of the cumulative number.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. The number of stars with parallax greater than a certain value plx is N(plx). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant, so the number of stars in a shell between d and d+dd is 4π d² n dd.

But we can express this in terms of plx. Let me see:

d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

Thus, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is:

dN = 4π (1/plx)^2 n * (- (1/plx²) d plx )

Which simplifies to dN = -4π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

But since d plx is positive (we're considering a small increase in plx), the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, the number of stars decreases, which makes sense because closer stars (higher plx) are fewer in number at larger distances.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is dN = 4π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but that's the differential, so the number per unit plx is dN/d plx = 4π n (1/plx^4).

So the number of stars per unit range of plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, option D is 1/plx^3.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check my math. Because when I substitute, d plx is small. But I'm looking for the number of stars per unit plx, so the number is the number in a shell of thickness d plx, which is dN = 4π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is dN/d plx = 4π n (1/plx^4), so it's proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Wait, the number per unit plx is dN/(d plx) = 4π n (1/plx^4).

So option A says ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that the number of stars decreases with distance, and the distribution of parallax. Let me think about the volume element again.

Another approach: The number of stars between parallax plx and plx + dplx is the number of stars at distance d = 1/plx to d - Δd, where Δd is small.

The volume of the spherical shell at distance d is 4π d² dd.

But we can express dd in terms of dplx:

d = 1/plx → dd = -d² dplx.

So the number of stars in this shell is 4π d² n * (-d² dplx) = -4π n d^4 dplx.

But d = 1/plx, so substituting:

4π n (1/plx)^4 * (-dplx) → the number is 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx is 4π n (1/plx^4). So the answer is A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait another thought. I thought I might have made a mistake because I've heard that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to 1/d^3, but maybe that's when considering the density. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the variables.

Alternatively, another approach: Since the number of stars is uniform in space, the number of stars at a distance d is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4π d^2 * thickness. But because we're integrating over d, the number of stars in a thin shell would be 4π d^2 n dd. So when we change variables from d to plx (since plx = 1/d), then dd = - d^2 dplx. Substituting, the number of stars becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 n * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is given by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. A higher parallax corresponds to a closer star.

The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), where \( d\text{plx} \) is a small change in parallax.

The number of stars in this shell becomes:
\[
dN = 4\pi d^2 n dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 n \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
dN = -4\pi n \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]
The negative sign indicates that as \( \text{plx} \) increases (closer stars), the number of stars decreases. The number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is therefore:
\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} = 4\pi n \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]
This shows that the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to \( \text{plx}^4 \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), which corresponds to option A.
