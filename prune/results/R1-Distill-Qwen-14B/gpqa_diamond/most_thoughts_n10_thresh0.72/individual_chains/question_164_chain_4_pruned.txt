Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, binary star systems and their masses. Oh right, I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their radial velocity variations can help determine their masses.

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periodsâ€”2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. They're asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are A to D.

Wait, so I think I need to find the mass ratio between system_1 and system_2. Because the question says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2." So like, mass of system_1 divided by mass of system_2.

But how do I get the masses from the given RV data. Oh right, the radial velocity method. I remember that for a binary system, the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude because it's closer to the center of mass. So the velocity is inversely proportional to mass.

The formula I think is the mass function. Let me recall. For a binary system, the mass function is (v2^3)/(v1 + v2)^2 = (M1^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 - e^2) ) ), but wait, this might be complicated because it involves inclination angles and eccentricity. But since both systems are eclipsing, their inclinations are likely close to 90 degrees, so sin i is about 1. Also, if the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term becomes 1. So maybe things simplify.

Wait, but the problem gives the RV amplitudes for both stars. So for system_1, star A has velocity amplitude 10 km/s, star B 5. So the stars have velocities v1 and v2 such that v1 = 10, v2 =5.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because M1*v1 = M2*v2. Right, center of mass condition.

So M1/M2 = v2/v1. So for system_1, M1/M2 is 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2 in system_1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the masses are inversely proportional to velocities. So M1 = (v2 / v1) * M2. So if v1 is 10, v2 is 5, then M1 = (5/10) M2. So M1 is 0.5 M2.

Wait, but that's the ratio of the masses of the two stars in system_1. But the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2. Let me denote M1 = m1 and M2 = m2 for system_1. So m1 = (v2 / v1) * m2. Wait, no, let me think again.

In system_1, the two stars have velocities v1=10 and v2=5. Since the system's center of mass must be stationary, the relation is m1*v1 = m2*v2. So m1 = (m2 * v2) / v1. So m1 = (m2 * 5) /10 = m2 * 0.5. So m1 is half of m2. Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Because the total mass is m1 + m2. Let me think. Suppose system_1's total mass is M1_total = m1 + m2. Since m1 = 0.5 m2, M1_total = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Similarly, for system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10. So for system_2, star A has v1=15, star B v2=10. So again, m1'*v1' = m2'*v2'. So m1' = (m2' * v2') / v1' = (m2' *10)/15 = (2/3) m2'.

So the total mass of system_2 is m1' + m2' = (2/3 m2') + m2' = (5/3) m2'.

But wait, wait. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think in terms of mass ratios. Another
