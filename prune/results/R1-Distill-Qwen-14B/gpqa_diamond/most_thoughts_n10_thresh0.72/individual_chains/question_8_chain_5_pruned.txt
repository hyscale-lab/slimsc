Okay, I'm trying to figure out this genetics question. Let me read through it carefully and see what I can understand.

So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine plants regarding resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They have three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The experiment tested the resistance of each mutant compared to the wild-type, which had 100% resistance.

The data given is the resistance percentages:

- g1: 75% (so 25% reduction)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

The question is about the conclusions we can draw from these results, especially regarding which gene is a transcription factor and the interactions between the genes (like epistasis or pleiotropy).

I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of B depends on A. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but here maybe it's about multiple genes affecting the same trait.

Given that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream, which suggests it's regulating other genes. So, the transcription factor is probably in a regulatory pathway.

Let me think about the data. The wild type has 100%, so when a single mutant has lower (like g1 at 75%, g3 at 50%, g2 at 0%), that's their individual effect.

The double mutants are interesting. The g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants have the same resistance as g2. So, when you have both g2 and another gene knocked out, the resistance is the same as g2. That suggests that g2 is epistatic to the other genes. Because if g2 is broken, the other gene's function doesn't matter anymore. So, the phenotype of the double mutant is the same as the more severe single mutant. That implies that g2 is upstream in the pathway.

Wait, because in a pathway, if you break an upstream gene, the downstream genes can't compensate since their signals aren't received. So, if g2 is a transcription factor (upstream), then knocking it out (g2) would render the downstream genes (like G1 and G3) inactive regardless of their own status. So, in the double mutants where g2 is also knocked out, the resistance is as bad as in g2 alone.

Let me look at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g3: 10% (this is worse than either g1 or g3 alone)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)

Wait, g1g3 is worse than either single. How does that fit in?

Wait, the question says one of the genes is a transcription factor upstream of others. So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor.

If G2 is the TF, then its knockout would mean that target genes (like G1 and G3) are not expressed. So, in the double mutants where G2 is knocked out (g1g2, g2g3), the resistance is 0%, same as g2. Which would make sense because without G2, G1 and G3 can't function as they are downstream.

But what about the double mutant g1g3? Their resistance is 10%, which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 have some overlapping functions. Like, they might be redundant or have additive effects.

Wait, redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other, but if both are knocked out, the effect is worse. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant (acting in the same pathway), then knocking both out would lead to a more severe phenotype than either single knockout. That's what we
