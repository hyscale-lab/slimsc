Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about an electron traveling at a certain speed and the uncertainty in its energy. The given data are the speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction and the uncertainty in position Δx = 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but sometimes people approximate this as Δx * Δp ≈ ħ, especially when dealing with minimum uncertainty cases. So I'll go with that for this calculation.

So first, I need to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Once I have that, I can find ΔE because the uncertainty in energy relates to the uncertainty in momentum through the kinetic energy formula.

But wait, the electron is moving at a speed v, so its momentum p is m*v. But since we're dealing with uncertainties, I think Δp would be related to the uncertainty in velocity, Δv. Hmm, actually no, wait. Because the position uncertainty is given, but the momentum uncertainty is directly connected via the uncertainty principle. So I'll proceed with Δx and Δp first.

Calculating Δp: Using the uncertainty principle, Δp ≈ ħ / Δx.

I should remember the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But maybe for rough calculations, I can approximate it as 1e-34 J·s. But let me double-check: 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) is roughly 1.05e-34, yes.

So Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters, since 1 nm is 1e-9 m. So Δx = 1e-10 m.

Putting these into the equation: Δp ≈ ħ / Δx = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-10 m) ) = 1.05e-24 kg·m/s. Wait, because 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s², so J·s is kg·m²/s, and when you divide by meters, you get kg·m/s which is the unit for momentum. So that's correct.

Now, the next step is to relate Δp to the uncertainty in energy ΔE. But wait, the electron has kinetic energy, so
