Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out an algorithm based on the given outputs. The question shows two examples: AGG gives 115 and TGCTGA gives 176. Then I have to find the value for ACAGTGACC from the options provided.

Hmm, let me think. Maybe the algorithm is converting each nucleotide into a number and then adding them up. I remember that sometimes in DNA problems, each base is assigned a value. Like A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4 or something like that. Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, they could be using their positions in the alphabet, like A=1, C=3, etc. Wait, but let's check the examples to see which makes sense.

First example: AGG -> 115. Let's break it down. If each letter converts to a number, and then the sum is 115. Let's see. AGG has three letters. Suppose A is 1, G is 4, then 1 + 4 +4 = 9. But 9 is nowhere near 115. So that's not it. Maybe each letter has a higher value.

Wait, maybe it's based on the number of letters multiplied by something. AGG is 3 letters. 3 times what is 115? 115/3 is around 38.3, which probably isn't an integer. Hmm, that's not making sense. Another idea: perhaps each base is converted into its position in the double-helix structure. Or maybe it's the sum of the positions of each nucleotide in the alphabet. Let's think: A is 1 (since A is the 1st letter), C is 3, G is 7 (since G is the 7th letter?), wait no, G is the 7th in the alphabet? Wait, A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7). Oh wait, no, G is 7. T is 20. Oh, because T is the 20th letter? Wait, no. The English alphabet has 26 letters. A is 1, B is 2, up to Z being 26. So T would be 20. Let me see.

So for AGG:
