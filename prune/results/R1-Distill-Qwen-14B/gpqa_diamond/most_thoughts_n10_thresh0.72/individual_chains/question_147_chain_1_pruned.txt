Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an annihilation process: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV/c². I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with various c fractions.

Hmm, annihilation usually involves particles and their antiparticles converting into other particles. But the specifics here... So, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The products are two particles of A⁺ and two of A⁻. 

Wait, protons and antiprotons annihilating typically produce pions, but in this case, it's producing these A particles. Maybe the A particles are like mesons or something else, but the exact identity might not matter for calculating velocity.

Given that the antiproton is moving slowly, which suggests that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can treat this as a low-energy approximation. But wait, the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV. So the mass of the A particles is 300 MeV/c² each.

Wait, but the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me recall their masses. A proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². The antiproton has the same mass. So the total rest mass energy of the initial system is 2 * 938 ≈ 1876 MeV.

The products are four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV, so the total rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Hmm, that's a lot less than the initial 1876 MeV. So that suggests that there's a lot of energy available—maybe a lot of kinetic energy in the products.

But wait, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So the initial system has rest mass energy 1876 MeV, and the products have a total rest mass of 1200 MeV. So the energy difference is 676 MeV. That's a lot.

Now, since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can consider this as a situation where the initial kinetic energy isn't too high, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy, so we can use conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but in reality, when two particles collide, their total energy (including rest mass and kinetic) and momentum must be conserved. The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, which implies that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So perhaps the initial momentum is small compared to the rest mass terms.

Let me think about the initial system: the proton is presumably at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. Or wait, maybe both are moving? The question says the antiproton is slowly moving,
