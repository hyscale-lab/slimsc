Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right?

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is more massive. Oh, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius. So, same size but different masses.

I need to find the transit probability for each. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)), but wait, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part is 1. So the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a), but wait, not exactly. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, the transit probability is given by the formula (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a(1 - e²)^0.5)). But for circular orbits, e=0, so it's just (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (1/a). But wait, no, I'm mixing something up. The transit probability also depends on the geometry. The probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not sure. Or is it (R_p / R_s) * (1 / a) * some other factor?

Wait, I think it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * (1 + (R_s / a)))). Hmm, no, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

Wait, I remember the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (a^3))? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 /
