Okay, so I've got this question about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. And in geometry, the area of a pseudosphere is related to its curvature. Oh right, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem comes into play here. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

The metric given probably describes a surface with negative curvature. Let me try to analyze the metric. The general form of a metric in 2D is ds² = E dx² + G dy², but here it's written as (dx² + dy²) multiplied by a factor. So it's E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²), which suggests it's a conformally flat metric. That makes sense because pseudospheres can be represented using conformal metrics.

In such metrics, the Gaussian curvature K is given by the formula involving the Laplacian of the logarithm of the conformal factor. Wait, the formula is K = - (1/(2e)) * Laplacian(ln e), where e is the conformal factor. Or wait, maybe I have that wrong. I think the Gaussian curvature for a metric ds² = e^{2λ}(dx² + dy²) is K = -e^{-2λ}( (λ_xx + λ_yy) ), where λ is the function in the exponent. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed in terms of the function e itself. Let me get this right.

Wait, the general formula for Gaussian curvature when the metric is conformally flat, ds² = e^{2λ}(dx² + dy²), is K = -e^{-2λ} [ (λ_x)^2 + (λ_y)^2 + λ_xx + λ_yy ]? No, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Another approach: perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So, let me write this as ds² = (32) (dx² + dy²) / (4 - x² - y²). So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². Hmm.

Alternatively, the standard form for the metric of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) is ds² = dr² + (a² cosh²(r/a) / a²) dθ², but that's in polar coordinates. Wait no, that's for a sphere with positive curvature. For a pseudosphere (negative curvature), it's ds² = dr² + (a² sinh²(r/a)) dθ². But perhaps that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, the metric given resembles that of a hyperbolic space in some coordinates. Let me see: the metric is proportional to 1/(4 - r²), where r² =x² + y². So the denominator is 4 - r², which implies that the radius of curvature is related. Because in hyperbolic space, the metric is often written with a
