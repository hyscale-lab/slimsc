Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let me read the question again.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait, I need to remember what the stability constant means. Stability constant, β, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. For a metal-ligand complex, like Co(SCN)_n, the β is the constant for the reaction: Co^(2+) + n SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_n^(2-n+), and β = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co][SCN]^n).

So the problem gives four β values. Since the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^(2+) complex because dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands.

So I need to calculate the fraction of Co that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ among all possible cobalt species. The other species would be free Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^2- perhaps? Wait, but the β's given are up to β4=16. So the possible complexes are n=1 to n=4.

So the four complexes are: Co^(2+), [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(0), [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^(2-). Wait, but the β values provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So n=1 to 4.

Wait, the stability constants are in order from β1 to β4. So β1 is for the 1:1 complex, β2 for 2:1, etc. So each subsequent β is for adding another SCN-.

But wait,
