Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is related to the degrees of unsaturation. Each degree can be a ring or a double bond. Right, the formula is Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But wait, in this case, since it's an acid and reacting with HI and red phosphorus, I think this is a reaction involving the addition of HX to the molecule, perhaps opening rings or adding to double bonds.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, the main ring is a cyclohexene (so a six-membered ring with one double bond). The positions are 2, 3, 5. So the substituents are at the 2 and 5 positions.

Breaking it down: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). At carbon 2, there's a formyl group (CHO). And at carbon 5, there's a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent at position 5 is a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

So the structure is cyclohexene with a double bond at 3, a formyl group at 2, and a vinyl group at 5. Also, there's a carboxylic acid group attached. Wait, wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, I think. Because in cyclohexane derivatives, numbering starts such that the substituents get the lowest numbers. Hmm, maybe not
