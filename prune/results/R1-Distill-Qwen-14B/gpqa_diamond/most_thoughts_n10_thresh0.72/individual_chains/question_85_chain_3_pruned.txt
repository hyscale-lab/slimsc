Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem states both planets have the same albedo, so I don't need to worry about that difference.

The star's parameters are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2 with masses 7 and 5 Earth masses, and radii 1.7 and 1.3 Earth radii respectively. Both orbits are circular.

Wait, the question gives data about the Doppler shifts induced by each planet on the [OI] forbidden line. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 up to 0.04 Å. I think the Doppler shift is related to the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures the star's velocity towards or away from us due to the planet's gravitational pull. So the RV amplitude tells us about the mass and the distance of the planet from the star.

The Doppler shift formula I remember is: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ), but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since both planets are around the same star, the semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the distance from the star.

Wait, but I also know that the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) ) ) * (something with orbital period). Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, since the Doppler shift is proportional to the RV semi-amplitude, and the RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the planet's orbital period and mass, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no. The RV
