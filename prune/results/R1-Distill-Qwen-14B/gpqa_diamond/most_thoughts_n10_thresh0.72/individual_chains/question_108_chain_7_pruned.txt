Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and small values of m (the orbital magnetic quantum number). The magnetic field strength is given as 1 Tesla, and the wavelength of the transition is 0.4861 micrometers. The options are about the order of magnitude between the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (⟨H⟩) and ΔE.

Hmm, first, I need to recall what the paramagnetic coupling term refers to. I think that's the term in the Hamiltonian due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is given by the Zeeman term, which is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is related to the spin angular momentum or orbital angular momentum, depending on the context. Since the question mentions orbital magnetic quantum number m, I think it's the orbital Zeeman effect.

Wait, but wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, and m is the z-component. So m can be -l, ..., +l. Oh wait, no, m is the quantum number for the z-component of angular momentum. So the orbital Zeeman term would be something like (e/(2m_e)) * (L · B), but maybe more precisely, it's proportional to m times B, since L is in the direction of B (parallel to Oz).

The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two atomic energy levels, emitted or absorbed when the electron transitions between them. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I recall is the wavelength of the Balmer-alpha transition in hydrogen, corresponding to a transition from n=2 to n=3? Wait, no, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. Oh wait, the Balmer-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2, which emits a photon of about 656 nm, but wait, 0.486 micrometers is 486 nm, which would be the Balmer-beta line, perhaps from n=4 to n=2. Or maybe it's another transition. But regardless, the exact transition isn't as important as knowing how to compute the energy ΔE.

So first, I need to calculate ΔE using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength.

Then, I need to calculate the paramagnetic (Zeeman) coupling term. Since B is 1 Tesla, and m is small, perhaps the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field is ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, but wait: for orbital angular momentum, the magnetic moment is given by μ = (e/(2m_e)) * L, so the Zeeman energy is H = -μ·B. Since L is along B (Oz direction), this simplifies to H = - (e/(2m_e)) * L_z * B.

But L_z
