Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. It's about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω² r², right? And the question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy.

Wait, okay, I remember that in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but since it's isotropic, it's easier to think in terms of the total quantum number n, which is nx + ny + nz. Or wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the quantum numbers for each dimension. Alternatively, for a 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy eigenvalues are given by E = ħω (nx + ny + nz + 3/2 ), where nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Oh right, because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so the total is sum of each.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused between the 3D oscillator and the hydrogen atom. No, in hydrogen, the energy depends on n, the principal quantum number. But here, it's different because it's a harmonic oscillator in each direction.

So the third excited state. Wait, what's the counting here? Because the ground state is the lowest energy, then first excited, etc. So the ground state would be the state with the lowest possible energies in each direction. That would be nx=0, ny=0, nz=0? Because each n is zero. So the energy would be (0+0+0 +3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. Then the first excited state would have one of the n's as 1. Like nx=1, others zero. So energy (1+0+0 +3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. The second excited state could be, say, nx=2, others zero, which gives (2 + 0 + 0 + 3/2) = 7/2 ħω. Or another possibility is having two of the n's as 1: nx=1, ny=1, nz=0. That sum is 2, so E = (2 + 3/2) ħω = 7/2 ħω as well. So multiple states can have the same energy.

Wait, so the energy levels in 3D isotropic oscillator are degenerate based on the sum of the quantum numbers. Each sum (nx + ny + nz) = n_total, let's say, determines the energy as E = (n_total + 3/2) ħω. So the ground state is n_total=0, then n_total=1, etc.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the energy is (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. So for each state, the energy depends on the sum of the three quantum numbers. So the possible sum values start at 0 (ground state, all n=
