Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

Alright, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200Â°C without air. This caused a mixture of gases to form. These gases were passed through three tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results were: tube 1 gained 3.60g, tube 3 gained 0.80g (forming CuO), and tube 2 didn't change. Finally, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to figure out what the salts A and B are first. Let's think about the reactions involved when heating them. Since it's without air, it's probably a decomposition reaction. The gases formed must be reacting with the substances in each tube.

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong drying agent. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to dry gases because it reacts with water. So, any water vapor in the gas mixture would be absorbed here. The weight gain of 3.60g in tube 1 suggests that the gas passing through had some water vapor, which was captured by Mg(ClO4)2.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas didn't change the weight here, it probably didn't react with it. What gases don't react with Ca(OH)2 solution? Well, Ca(OH)2 is a base and reacts with acidic gases like CO2. If the gas didn't cause a weight change, maybe there's no CO2 or the amount was negligible. Alternatively, maybe it was a gas that doesn't react, like N2 or O2, but those are less likely. Or perhaps the gas passed through without reacting because it's already neutral, like NH3? Wait, no, NH3 is basic and would react with Ca(OH)2, but wait, if the solution is already saturated, maybe no reaction occurs? Or perhaps the gas is a noble gas, but that's probably not the case here. Hmm.

Then tube 3 is red-hot copper. The gas passed through and caused a weight gain of 0.80g of CuO. So, the gas must have reacted with copper. What gases react with copper when heated? I think CO would react, but wait, in the presence of O2, maybe? Or perhaps H2? Wait, when H2 is passed over hot CuO, it reduces it. But in this case, the copper is gaining mass, so maybe the gas is something that oxidizes the copper. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, which can react with copper oxide at high temperatures. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the gas is a sulfur-containing gas, but I don't have any clues about that. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2S, but that would react
