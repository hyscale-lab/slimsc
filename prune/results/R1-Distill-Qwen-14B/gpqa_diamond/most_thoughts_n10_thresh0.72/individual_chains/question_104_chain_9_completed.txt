Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method looks for shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is, the larger the shift, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So their masses are the same. Both planets have circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) depends on a few factors. I remember the formula K = (v * sin(i)) where v is the star's velocity. But more importantly, the formula for K in terms of the planet's mass and orbital parameters. Let me think. Oh right, the formula is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin(i)) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) 

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I'm trying to simulate a student's thought process. So, I need to recall the radial velocity equation. I think it's K = ( ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )

But wait, for small exoplanets compared to the star, M_p << M_star, so 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so that term is negligible. So we can approximate K as proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )

But in this case, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun. So M_p is the same for both, M_star is same, and both orbits are circular (e=0), so 1 - e² =1. So sin i is the same for both—wait, but we don't know the inclination angles. Oh, but the question says the RV method detected the planets, so I guess we can assume the same inclination for both, or that it's the same for each setup. Wait, but since the problem gives the observed wavelength shift, I think the formula would have (M_p sin i) in the numerator. Since both shifts are given, perhaps sin i is same for both, or maybe not. Hmm, the problem doesn't say anything about the inclination, but perhaps it's assumed to be the same for both, because otherwise we couldn't compare the K values.

So, for both planets, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_p is same, M_star same, so K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). 

So we have K1 = 5 milliangstrom, K2 =7 milliangstrom. So the ratio of K2 to K1 is 7/5 = 1.4.

But wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K2 = (1 / (P2^(1/3))) * constant. Similarly for K1. So K2 / K1 = (P1 / P2) )^(1/3) )

Wait, because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2

7^3 is 343, 5^3 is 125. So 343/125 = P1/P2

But the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So P2 = P1 * (125/343)

So the ratio (P2 / P1) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. Wait, but wait, the options are:

A) ~ 0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the question is, How many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means P2 is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So that would be 0.36 times longer? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I got the ratio wrong.

Wait, I think I should recheck.

K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then 1/P2^(1/3) is larger than 1/P1^(1/3) → meaning P2^(1/3) is smaller than P1^(1/3) → P2 is smaller than P1. So P2 is shorter period than P1.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2's period than P1's? So if P2 is shorter, the factor is less than 1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, meaning P2's period is 0.36 times P1's. So it's about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer is A) ~0.36.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the ratio. Let me go back.

We have K1 =5, K2=7.

The formula: K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, no. Let me write it correctly. K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant that depends on other factors (like mass of planet and star, etc.)

So K1 = C / (P1)^(1/3)

K2 = C / (P2)^(1/3)

So taking the ratio K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Because:

K2/K1 = (C/P2^(1/3)) / (C/P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So (7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → 343/125 = P1/P2 → P1 = (343/125) P2 → P1 = 2.744 P2.

So P1 is longer than P2. So P2 is shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the answer is approximately 0.36 times as long. So the correct answer is option A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this shift, \( K \), is related to the orbital period \( P \) of the planet. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This means that \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. For two planets with the same mass and host star mass, the ratio of their \( K \)-values can be used to determine the ratio of their orbital periods.

Given:
- Planet #1 causes a Doppler shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)).
- Planet #2 causes a Doppler shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)).

The ratio of the \( K \)-values is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times longer than Planet #1's.
