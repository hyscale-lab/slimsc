Okay, so I have this question about nuclear physics, specifically about the impulse approximation used in many-body calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which four assumptions imply the "impulse" approximation when considering interactions like electroweak. The options are combinations of statements 1 to 4.

So, what's the impulse approximation again? I remember it's a model where each nucleon in the nucleus behaves as if it's free, not influenced by the others except for a brief interaction. So, it's kind of like saying each nucleon feels no binding forces during the interaction. That sounds a bit like a sudden approximation or treating them as independent particles.

Looking at the statements:

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So, the force acts on each nucleon separately, not on the nucleus as a whole. That makes sense for the impulse because each nucleon is treated independently. So statement 1 is probably part of it.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, transparent meaning that other nucleons don't affect the interaction? If the nucleus is transparent, then only one nucleon is involved, others don't contribute to the interaction. That would mean each nucleon interacts as if others aren't there, so statement 2 supports the impulse approximation.

3. The quarks inside the nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, I'm not sure. Non-relativistic quarks would imply that their motion isn't at speeds close to light, so maybe it's easier to model their behavior. But does that directly contribute to the impulse approximation? I mean, the impulse approximation is more about the nuclear interactions, not the internal structure of the nucleon. I'm not certain if statement 3 is necessary.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, right! Because in the impulse approximation, the nucleon is treated as free during the interaction. So binding forces during the interaction are ignored. So statement 4 is definitely part of the assumptions.

Wait, the question is which assumptions jointly imply the approximation. So statements 1, 2, and 4 seem directly related. What about statement 3?

Statement 3 is about quarks being non-relativistic. I thought that the impulse approximation is more about treating nucleons as free, not their internal quarks. So maybe statement 3 is not part of the assumptions for the impulse approximation. Instead, perhaps it's a separate assumption about the internal nucleon structure, but not directly related to the impulse itself.

So the impulse approximation relies on the idea that each nucleon interacts as if it's free. So, statements 1 (only individual interaction), 2 (nucleus transparent except for the selected), and 4 (no binding forces experienced) are the key. So that would exclude statement 3.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 → This includes all three. So that's a possible candidate.

Option B: 2,3,4 → Includes 3, which I'm not sure about.

Option C: 1,2,3 → Includes 3.

Option D: 1,3,4 → Includes 3.

Hmm, so the correct assumptions are 1, 2, and 4. So the correct option should be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. What does statement 3 say? "The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic." How does that affect the approximation?

In the impulse approximation, perhaps the internal structure of the nucleon isn't considered. So, whether the quarks are relativistic or not—does that matter? Well, if the quarks are non-relativistic, their behavior is simpler, easier to model. But does that directly tie into the impulse approximation assumption?

Alternatively, maybe the impulse approximation doesn't require anything about the internal state, just about how the nucleon interacts with external forces. So statement 3 might not be a necessary condition for the approximation. Hence, the assumptions are 1, 2, and 4, making option A the correct choice.


The impulse approximation in nuclear physics assumes that nucleons in a nucleus behave as if they are free, experiencing no binding forces during interactions. To determine which assumptions jointly imply this approximation, we analyze the given statements:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This supports the impulse approximation because it treats each nucleon independently, as if it is free and unaffected by others.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This implies that other nucleons do not contribute to the interaction, reinforcing the idea that the selected nucleon behaves as if it is free.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic**: While this simplifies the modeling of the nucleon's internal structure, it does not directly contribute to the impulse approximation, which focuses on the nucleon's interaction rather than its internal state.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: This is a direct requirement of the impulse approximation, as it assumes the nucleon is free during the interaction.

From this analysis, statements 1, 2, and 4 are essential for the impulse approximation, while statement 3 is unrelated to the approximation itself. Therefore, the correct option is **A**, which includes statements 1, 2, and 4.

Answer: A
