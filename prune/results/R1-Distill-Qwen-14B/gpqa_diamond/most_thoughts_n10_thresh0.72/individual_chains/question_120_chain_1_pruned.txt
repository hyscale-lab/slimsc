Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Oh right, the parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a star with a larger parallax is closer, and a smaller parallax is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed... that means the number density of stars is constant in space. So if I imagine a sphere with radius d, the number of stars inside it should be proportional to the volume. Oh, right, volume is (4/3)πd³, so the number of stars is proportional to d³.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax plx is related to distance. Plx (in arcseconds) is approximately 1/d (where d is in parsecs). So d = 1/plx. If plx increases, the distance decreases, meaning stars are closer.

So let's think about a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. What's the corresponding distance range? If plx is small (far away), adding a unit of plx would mean a significant change in distance. Wait, to find the number of stars in a parallax range between plx and plx + dplx, I need to relate that to the number of stars in a distance range.

The parallax
