Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question shows four matrices W, X, Y, Z. The task is to determine which of the four statements (A to D) is correct based on these matrices. I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices represent various operators, and their properties are important for determining their roles.

First, I'll list out the matrices as they are given.

Matrix W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Matrix X is:
i, -1, 2i
1, 0, 1
2i, -1, -i

Matrix Y is:
0.5, 0.1, 0.2
0.1, 0.25, 0.1
0.2, 0.1, 0.25

Matrix Z is:
3, 2i, 5
-2i, -2, -4i
5,4i,4

The options are A, B, C, D.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that if a matrix is unitary, then its exponential is also unitary. Because unitary matrices preserve the norm when acting on vectors. So if e^X is unitary, then multiplying by e^X wouldn't change the norm. But wait, X is a matrix with complex entries. So for e^X to be unitary, X must be a skew-Hermitian matrix. Because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. 

Skew-Hermitian means that X† = -X, where † denotes the conjugate transpose. Let me check if X is skew-Hermitian.

First, compute X†:

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate transpose (X†) would have the first column as the first row's conjugate, etc.

Compute X†:

Conjugate of first row: (-i, -1, -2i) → becomes first column.
Second row conjugate: (1, 0, 1) → becomes second column.
Third row conjugate: (-2i, -1, i) → becomes third column.

So X† is:

- i   1    -2i
-1    0     -1
-2i   1     i

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct the conjugation:

Wait, the original X is:

Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [2i, -1, -i]

So the conjugate of each element:

Row 1: [-i, -1, -2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [-2i, -1, i]

Then, the transpose of that would be:

Column 1: -i, 1, -2i → first row of X†
Column 2: -1, 0, -1 → second row of X†
Column 3: -2i, 1, i → third row.

Wait, no. The transpose swaps rows and columns. So the first row of X† is the conjugate of the first column of X.

Wait, X's columns are:

Column 1: i, 1, 2i → conjugate is -i, 1, -2i → row 1 of
