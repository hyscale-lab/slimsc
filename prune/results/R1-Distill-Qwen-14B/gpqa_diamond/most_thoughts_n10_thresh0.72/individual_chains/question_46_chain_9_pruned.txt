Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A to D, with numbers ranging from 2 to 8.

Hmm. Right, Grubbs catalyst is involved in olefin metathesis reactions. I remember that Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, probably ruthenium-based, used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups, breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene has a double bond starting at C1. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)₂? No, wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons. So positions 1 to 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on the third carbon. Let me number: 1 2 3 4 5. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right because pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Oh wait, but it's 3-methyl, so on the third carbon of the pentene, which is the third carbon of the chain. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂CH3? No, wait, maybe I should write it more precisely.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the main chain is five carbons, double bond at 1-2. So, structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Adding a methyl group on the third carbon (the CH₂ in the middle), so it becomes CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)₂? Because the third carbon in pent-1-ene is the CH₂ after the double bond, so adding
