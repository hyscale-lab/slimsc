Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on NMR, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. So the structure probably has an ester group (since it's acetate) and an allyl group with a double bond that's either cis or trans.

The given NMR data is:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, the singlet at 2.1 ppm. That's probably the acetate group. Because in acetates, the methyl group (OAc) is usually around 2.1 ppm as a singlet. So that makes sense. So the structure is an acetate, as I thought.

Then the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. A doublet suggests two neighboring protons. Wait, 16 Hz is a pretty large coupling constant, probably for a trans double bond. Because typically, in trans alkenes, the coupling is larger than in cis. Oh wait, in cis, the coupling is usually around 10-12 Hz, and trans is higher, around 15-17 Hz. So J=16 means trans, right? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up things.

Wait, in trans alkenes, the vicinal coupling (H2C=CH) is larger because the dihedral angle is 180°, so the coupling constant J is bigger. For cis, the dihedral is 0°, so smaller J. Wait, no, wait: when the dihedral is 180°, the coupling is actually positive and the maximum for trans is about 16 Hz or so. So if I have a doublet with J=16, that's a trans coupling.

Wait, but the structure is an acetate. So the structure is something like CH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, but the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. So let's think about the structure.

The other peaks are at 5.5 ppm and 1.6 ppm. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, that's more complex. And the 1.6 ppm is a doublet with 3H, so probably a CH2 group attached to another CH2 or CH group.

Let me think about the possible structures. The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Wait, the 'butenyl' would have four carbons, and 'propenyl' is three. So for butenyl, maybe the structure is CH2CHCH2COOCH3? No, but butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, butenyl would have a double bond. So butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2— wait, no, that's butenyl with four carbons. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is in the middle.

Wait, but the options are about propenyl and butenyl. So for propenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or is it CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond? Wait, propenyl would be something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but the double bond could be in different positions.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think of the structure as an ester, so the structure is (CH2)something connected to the ester. Let me think about each option.
