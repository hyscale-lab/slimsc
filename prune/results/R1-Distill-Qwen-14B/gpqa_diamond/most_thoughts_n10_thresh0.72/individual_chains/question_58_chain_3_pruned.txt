Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think...

Okay, first, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinite results that don't make physical sense. It's a way to handle those infinities so that calculations can proceed and give finite, meaningful answers. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or maybe they have other mechanisms at play.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. Let me look at each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is different from other quantum field theories because it's a theory of strings rather than point particles. At high energies, string theories are supposed to avoid some of the divergences that plague other quantum theories. Because strings have a length scale (the string length), maybe they naturally regulate high-energy behavior. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't need regularization as much as others.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD does require renormalization because of things like the running coupling constant and the presence of things like Landau poles. Wait, but at high energies, QCD becomes weakly coupled because of asymptotic freedom. But does that mean it doesn't need regularization? Or maybe it's the opposite. I think QCD calculations still need regularization techniques because even though it's asymptotically free, perturbative expansions might still have divergences. So regularization is probably still needed here.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and quantum effects. I know that QED has issues with divergences, like the electron self-energy and vacuum polarization. These require regularization methods. For example, using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, this is the classical version, not the quantum one. Classical theories don't have the same issues with divergences as quantum ones. Like, in classical electromagnetism, the fields might have singularities at point charges, but those are handled differently—maybe through the concept of charge density or distributions. Since regularization is a quantum field theory concept, classical theories wouldn't require it. So classical electrodynamics wouldn't need any regularization because it's not a quantum theory.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization
