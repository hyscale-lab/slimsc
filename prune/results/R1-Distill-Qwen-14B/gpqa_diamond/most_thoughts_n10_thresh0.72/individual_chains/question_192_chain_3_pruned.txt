Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R, so it's completely inside the conductor. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, I think that's the angle between the line from the cavity's center to P and the line from the conductor's center to the cavity's center.

I remember that when you have a charge inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so when we put a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor must respond. I think the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q to balance it because the conductor was neutral overall.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the charge inside the cavity attracts the opposite charge on the conductor's inner surface. Then, since the conductor as a whole was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the -q on the inner surface.

Now, the electric field outside a conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface. So, for a point outside the conductor, the field should be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's because the conductor's symmetry makes the field outside similar to a point charge at the center.

So when considering the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, the charges to consider are the outer charges. Since the outer charge is +q, the field should be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the options have different expressions. Let's look at the options. Option B is exactly that: (1/4πε₀) * q / L². But wait, what about the position of the charge inside the cavity? Would that affect the external field?

Oh, right! Because the conductor shields the outside from the internal distribution. So the external field doesn't depend on where the charge is placed inside the cavity as long as it's inside. Because the conductor's inner surface adjusts to cancel the field within the conductor material.

Wait, but the conductor's inner surface will have a charge distribution that's dependent on the charge's position. For example, if the charge is close to the inner surface, more negative charge would accumulate there. But for the external field, the outer surface has a charge of +q, regardless of where
