Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me the angular size of the event horizon as θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. I remember that the event horizon's radius relates to the mass of the black hole, and the entropy is connected to the area of the event horizon via the formula S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area.

Wait, right, the area of a sphere is 4πr². So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon. The angular size θ is given in degrees, but I need to convert that into radians because the formula for the radius involves θ in radians. Oh wait, the formula I think I should use is r = θ * d, but wait, that's only when θ is in radians because the small angle approximation says that r ≈ d θ (in radians). So I need to convert θ from degrees to radians.

So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). Let me compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad is approximately (1e-17) * (π/180). Let me calculate that. Let's see, pi is about 3.14, so 3.14/180 is roughly 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, but wait. If the angular size θ is the angle subtended by the event horizon at a distance d, then the size of the event horizon (radius r) is approximately r = d * θ (in radians). So r ≈ d * θ_rad.

Wait, d is given as 1e10 parsecs. I should convert parsecs into meters because the formulas usually use SI units. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So
