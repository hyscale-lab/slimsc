Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, like esters or maybe nitriles, but wait, no, nitriles are more with HCl and Pd. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of esters to acids, or maybe for something else like elimination? Wait, no, wait. Oh! Maybe it's for the dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps for elimination reactions. Alternatively, another thought: maybe it's related to the hydrolysis of an epoxide? No, that's usually with H2O and acid or base. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI—I think that's used in the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. Because when you treat an ester with HI and red phosphorus, it can lead to acid formation. Or wait, another reaction: the Wurtz reaction? No, that's for eliminating to form alkenes between two alkyl halides. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: when you have a nitrile, treatment with HI and red phosphorus can lead to the formation of a carboxylic acid. Oh right, that's the hydrolysis of nitriles. So maybe the starting compound has a nitrile group. Or wait, wait, perhaps it's about the hydrolysis of an ester. Let me get back to the beginning.

The starting compound is X, and we need to find out what it is first, based on the IR and NMR data. Then, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, we can predict the product.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks are in 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, likely O-H stretch. Then, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1
