Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. 

Alright, the problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, I guess that means the relative speed between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s, but wait, direction-wise, I need to clarify. If the ejecta is moving towards the center, then from the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, no, wait. If the ejecta is moving towards the center, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at some speed. But in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it, so their speeds are relative. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think about relative velocity.

In such problems, the relative velocity between two frames is the same as the speed of one frame as seen from the other, right? Oh wait, but when considering motion along a straight line, the velocities add in the opposite direction. So if the Galaxy is at rest and the ejecta is moving towards it at v, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v. Wait, no, that can't be. Because if the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the Galaxy's center, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center would appear to be moving towards it at velocity v. So maybe the relative speed is v, so v is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So that would imply that the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center in the Galaxy's frame. Because from the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So that's the speed.

But wait, I'm not sure. Because
