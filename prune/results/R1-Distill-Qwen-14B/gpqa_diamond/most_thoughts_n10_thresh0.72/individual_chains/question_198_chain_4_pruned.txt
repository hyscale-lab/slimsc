Okay, so I've got this problem here about the concentration of cobalt complexes. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my coordination chemistry, but I'll try to remember what I can.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given for different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Hmm, I think the blue one is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, wait. I recall that the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^+, which is blue, and the tetrathiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_4]^2- which is green. So the question is about the dithiocyanato, which is the one with two SCN- ions.

Stability constants, right. So β for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^m is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from Co^2+ and SCN^- ions. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The general approach for these kinds of problems is to calculate the concentration distribution of each complex species present. Since the solution contains Co^2+ and SCN^-, the various complexes will form according to their stability constants. We're to find the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex.

Wait, wait. Or is it [Co(SCN)_2]^+? Because Co^2+ with two SCN^- would have a charge of 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0, but I might be getting confused. Alternatively, some complexes have different charges. Maybe I should double-check. [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) would be:

For n=1: Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1)
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) minus 2 SCN^- would make it neutral. Hmm, wait, no. Let's think: each SCN^- is -1. So if Co^2+ binds two SCN^-, that's 2*(-1) = -2. So Co^2+ (charge +2) plus two SCN^- (each -1) would give [Co(SCN)_2]^0, a neutral complex. But that's maybe not common. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), because each SCN is -1. Let me think: Co^2+ is the central ion, and each SCN contributes -1. So for n=1, complex is [CoSCN]^+, because 2+ + (-1) = +1. For n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, because 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. Wait, but I'm not sure if that
