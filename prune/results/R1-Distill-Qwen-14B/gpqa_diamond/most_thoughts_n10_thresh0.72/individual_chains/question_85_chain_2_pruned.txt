Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

First, the question gives me the mass, radius, and temperature of the star. The star's mass is 1.5 times that of the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and effective temperature 6300 K. Then there are two planets: Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 has 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits.

The problem mentions that both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. Oh, right, the transit method measures the dip in brightness when a planet passes in front of the star, which tells us about the planet's size and orbit. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star, giving us the mass and the orbital period.

But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperatures. So I should remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. I think it's something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), right? Or wait, let me get the exact formula right. The equilibrium temperature is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The planet absorbs energy from the star and radiates it as blackbody radiation. So the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s / (2d)), where d is the distance from the star to the planet (the semi-major axis, a). But wait, the exact formula might have a different exponent. Oh right, the formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4), where a is the planet's albedo. But wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so the (1 - a) term cancels out in the ratio. So we don't have to worry about that part.

So the key variables are the semi-major axis of each planet's orbit. Because equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. So I need to find the semi-major axes of both planets.

Wait, the problem gives me data about the radial velocity shifts. Oh, right, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K involves the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period. But wait, I don't think the period is given. Hmm.

Wait, but I remember that for the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / a_p^(1/3)) ), but
