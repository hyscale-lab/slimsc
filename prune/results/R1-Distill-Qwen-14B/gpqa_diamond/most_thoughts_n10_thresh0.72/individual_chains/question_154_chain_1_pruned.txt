Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully.

So, the chemist found a white solid, and he has some spectral data to identify it. The options are four different compounds, and I need to match the data to one of them.

Starting with the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's a peak at m/z 158 which is 32%. Hmm, wait, the molecular ion is 156, but there's another peak at 158. That might be a fragment or perhaps a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has a common isotope at around 35Cl and 37Cl. The presence of Cl would lead to two peaks: one at m/z = 156 (M) and another at M+2 which would be 158, since each Cl adds 2 mass units. So that suggests the molecular formula probably includes a Cl. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

Wait, all the options except maybe C have Cl. Phenyl chloroformate might have Cl, but I'm not sure. Let's see.

The IR spectrum shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). So the compound has a carbonyl, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, ester, or something else.

Looking at the options again:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This has a hydroxyl group (so O-H) and an aldehyde (CHO). The aldehyde would have a peak around 2800-2720 cm^-1 (stretching) and a strong peak around 1720 for the carbonyl. Wait, but aldehydes also show up in NMR as a singlet around 9-10 ppm.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is a carboxylic acid. The O-H from the carboxylic acid would be a broad peak, which matches the IR. The carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700-1725 cm^-1, so that fits. The broad O-H would also fit.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: Structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. Here, the carbonyl is present, but I'm not sure about O-H. Unless it's a different functional group. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. That's an ester. So esters have a carbonyl, but no O-H unless there's a hydroxyl group, which I don't think is present here. So the IR would show the ester carbonyl (around 1720 cm^-1) but no broad O-H. But the question says the IR has a broad peak, so maybe this is not C.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Same as B, a carboxylic acid with Cl. So O-H would be broad, carbonyl around ~1720.

Now the 1H NMR data:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a strong singlet. High chemical shift suggests an acidic proton. For a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But in the NMR, this one is a singlet, which is a bit confusing because carboxylic acid OH is usually broad. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they are deshielded and appear as a singlet. Wait, this is 11 ppm, which is higher than typical aldehyde protons. Or maybe it's a phenolic OH? Phenolic OHs can be around 5-10 ppm, but sometimes downfield. Wait, but a phenol OH is usually less deshielded than a carboxylic acid OH. Carboxylic acid OH is more downfield, around 12 ppm sometimes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So that's a benzaldehyde with a Cl and an OH group. The
