Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to determine the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

First, I'll tackle part A. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, typically by an enolate.

So dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. Wait, dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. I think it's a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be the Michael acceptor since it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

In the Michael reaction, the enolate from the donor (malonate) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So the structure of the acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the substituent is at the 3 position. Oh wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl (a benzene ring with a methyl group para to the point of attachment) is at carbon 3.

So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but with the substituent on the third carbon. Wait, no, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, perhaps I got that wrong. Wait, the IUPAC name. For acrylate,
