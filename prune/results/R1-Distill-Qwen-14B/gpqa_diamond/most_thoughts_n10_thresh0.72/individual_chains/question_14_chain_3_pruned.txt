Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and the effects of different fixation methods. Let's think through this step by step.

The question says that when PFA was used for fixation, there were ChIP peaks for the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. But when they used PFA+DSG, those peaks disappeared. I'm a bit rusty on my ChIP-seq details, but I remember that fixation methods can influence what you get in your results.

So, PFA is paraformaldehyde. I think it's a common fixative that cross-links proteins to DNA. DSG is disuccinimidoglycoluril, another crosslinker, often used in tandem with PFA. Wait, but why would using both cause peaks to disappear?

I remember that during fixation, the goal is to stabilize protein-DNA interactions so that during the sonication step, you shear the DNA into small fragments. But if the crosslinking is too strong, maybe the sonication isn't efficient enough. Or maybe the opposite happens, that some regions are harder to shear when different crosslinkers are used.

Wait, in ChIP-seq, the antibody is against a protein (here, IKAROS), and it should bind DNA regions where the protein is located. So if the peaks disappeared, perhaps the protein-DNA complexes aren't being captured as effectively when both PFA and DSG are used.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the efficiency of crosslinking. DSG is a protein crosslinker that targets lysine residues. PFA crosslinks proteins to DNA, but
