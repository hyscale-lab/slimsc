Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can get tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will give the desired product with high yield.

First, I'll try to draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, numbering might be a bit confusing. Let me think. The positions are 1, 2, and 3 in a row. Wait, the structure is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. So, the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So, numbering so that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, it's meta to each other? Or perhaps in a para arrangement? Hmm, maybe I should clarify the positions.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let me imagine the benzene ring with three substituents. Let's say position 1 is where the ethoxy group is attached. Then, position 2 is the tert-butyl group, and position 3 is the nitro group. So, they're all adjacent in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a 1,2,3 arrangement where each is next to the other. Hmm, wait, but 1, 2, and 3 positions are adjacent in a row on the ring.

But perhaps I should first think about the order of substitutents and how they can be introduced via electrophilic substitution. Since benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution, each substituent can direct the incoming group. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and either meta or para directors.

So, let's list the substituents:

1. Ethoxy group (-OEt): This is an
