Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the question says each spectrograph has a limit on the apparent V magnitude of the stars they can observe. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can see up to 16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 in V is observable by ESPRESSO, and stars brighter than 16 are for HIRES. But wait, actually, wait a second. I think the way it's phrased is that stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Magnitudes are tricky because lower numbers mean brighter. So if the V magnitude is, say, 16, that's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly for HIRES, anything below 16 is okay.

So the key is to find the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones fall below both thresholds. Because both instruments can detect them, the star's apparent magnitude must be <=16 for HIRES (which is more sensitive) and <=17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no. Wait, no, because if a star is brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. But if it's brighter than 16, HIRES can see it. So a star that's brighter than 17 would be too faint for HIRES, right? Because 17 is fainter than 16. Wait, no, because lower magnitude is brighter. So, for example, a star with V=15 is brighter than V=16, which is brighter than V=17.

So, let me think. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V < 17. HI
