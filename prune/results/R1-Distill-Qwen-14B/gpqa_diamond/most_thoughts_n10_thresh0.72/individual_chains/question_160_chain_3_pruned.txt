Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember something about diffraction patterns and apertures. Wait, for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22λ/(diameter), right? But this isn't a circle; it's a polygon with N sides, and N is very large. So, as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? But wait, the question says all apothems are the same. Oh wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the radius.

Wait, for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is equal to the radius times cos(π/N). Because each side is a triangle with vertex angle 2π/N, and the apothem is the adjacent side in a right triangle where the hypotenuse is the radius R.

So, R = a / cos(π/N). But when N becomes very large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So maybe the problem reduces to a circular aperture?

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the first two minima. Oh, but for a circular aperture, there's only the first minimum, right? Because the diffraction pattern for a circle is symmetric and the minima are at specific angles. Wait, no, I think the first minimum is the first dark ring, but the minima in the far field... wait, perhaps it's the minima in the intensity pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22λ/(2a), since the radius is a, so diameter is 2a. So θ = 1.22λ/(2a) = 0.61λ/a.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula I remember for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction is a*sinθ = λ, but that's for
