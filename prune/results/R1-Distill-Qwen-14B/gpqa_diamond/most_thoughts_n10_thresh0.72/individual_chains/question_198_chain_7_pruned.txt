Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants have something to do with the formation of complexes. Let's see. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in solution.

The given data includes the concentration of Co(II) ions, which is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given for four different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, that seems a bit odd because I thought β values are usually in a certain order. Oh, right, they're given in order of increasing complexes. So CoSCN^+ is β1, Co(SCN)_2^(2+) is β2, Co(SCN)_3^(3+) is β3, and Co(SCN)_4^(4-) is β4. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, the stability constants are for each step. Let me think.

Wait, stability constants are cumulative. So β1 is for the first complex: Co(SCN)SCN^+? Or no, wait. Let me get this straight. The general formula for the formation of a complex is stepwise. For example, the formation of Co(SCN)_n can be viewed as multiple steps. The overall stability constant for each step is given. So β1 is for Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+ (with β1=9), β2 is for CoSCN^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^(2+) (β2=40), and so on. So the overall stability constant for the third complex would be β1*β2*β3, right? Because each step multiplies the previous.

Wait, but the problem gives each β. So the total for each complex would be the product of the preceding βs. So for the first complex, β1=9. Second, β1*β2=9*40=360. Third, 9*40*63=22680. Fourth, 9*40*63*16= 9*40 is 3
