Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, right, Einstein's equation E=mc², so the rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV. That's a lot of energy! 

Then, the nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. Wait, so the initial mass is M, and after fission, the two fragments' masses add up to 0.99M. That means some mass was converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in nuclear reactions, mass can be converted into energy.

So the initial nucleus is at rest, and when it splits into two fragments, they must move in opposite directions because of conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after must also be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the one calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, so I think I need to calculate T1 using both relativistic and classical methods and then find the difference.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the masses of the two fragments.
2. Use conservation of energy and momentum to find their velocities or energies.
3. Calculate the kinetic energy using the correct relativistic formula and the classical approximation (non-relativistic KE is (1/2)mv²).
4. Find the difference between the two T1 values.

First, the masses. Let me denote the two fragments as m1 and m2, where m1 is the more massive one. Given that m1 = 2 m2. And m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Let's solve for m1 and m2.

So, substituting m1 = 2m2 into the sum: 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So m1 is 0.66 M.

But wait, the initial rest mass is M, and after fission, the sum is 0.99 M. So the total mass has decreased by 1% of M, which is 0.01 M. That mass deficit is converted into kinetic energy and binding energy (if any), but the problem says to ignore electrons, so I think only kinetic energy is considered here.

Wait, the problem says the sum of rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So the rest mass after fission is 0.99 M, which is less than initial M. So the rest mass energy after is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The initial was 300 GeV, so the energy released
