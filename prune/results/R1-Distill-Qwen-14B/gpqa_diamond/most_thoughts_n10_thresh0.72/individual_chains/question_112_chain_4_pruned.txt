Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem gives me a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so that's the standard basis for spin-1/2 systems. The question is asking me to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The Aij elements are hbar/2 if i ≠ j and zero otherwise.

Wait, so the operator has elements A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 when i=j. Let me think about what kind of matrix that would be. For a 2x2 system, the matrix would look like:
[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]
So that's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. That reminds me of the Pauli matrices, but scaled somehow. Oh right, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A matrix is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, but the question is about finding the eigenstates of this operator A. Because the probabilities are for measuring the eigenstates of A. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, compute the probabilities of the |alpha> state being in each of those eigenstates, and then find the average value of A.

Alternatively, maybe the operator A is given, and the eigenstates are for the operator. So the first part is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

Let me write the matrix A:
A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

To find the eigenvalues, I can solve the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

The determinant is (−λ)(−λ) − (ħ/2)^2 = λ² − (ħ²/4) = 0. So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The eigenvectors can be found for each eigenvalue
