Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. There are four compounds listed, and the options are combinations of them.

First, I need to remember what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Chiral centers can result in enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers are optically active, which is why they're called optical isomers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are at the 2 and 2', and 6 and 6' positions. Wait, each phenyl ring has a carbonyl group from the carboxylate. So, the structure is two phenyl rings connected with a single bond. The substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. The question is: does this structure allow for any chiral centers?

Wait, the carbonyl from the ester is a substituent on each ring. Each ring is attached to a methyl ester group. So, the central position (the single bond between the two phenyl rings) isn't a carbon; it's a carbon-carbon bond. So, the carbons in the rings are connected to three other carbons (the ring) and some substituents. But wait, in biphenyl structures, each ring's position 1 is connected to the other ring. So, the carbons at positions 2 and 6 have substituents. Let me think about whether any carbon has four different groups.

Each of the two central carbons (the ones in the biphenyl) might be attached to the other ring and other groups. But wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2', 6 and 6'. So, each ring has a -OOCR group (since it's a dimethyl ester), and another nitro group at 6 and 6'. 

Wait, maybe the central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) isn
