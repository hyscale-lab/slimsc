Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So, 2 times the elementary charge. The masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. And the question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the potential energy in a system of charges is related to the work done to assemble them. Since the system is isolated, I don't have to consider any external fields, just the interactions between the charges themselves.

Wait, but the setup here is a bit tricky. The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, I'm picturing 12 charges placed on a sphere of radius 2m around P, each at a distance of 2m from P. The charge at P is fixed, so any work done to bring the other charges into place would involve that central charge.

But wait, when calculating the potential energy of a system of charges, I think we have to consider the energy required to assemble all the charges, bringing each one from infinity to their positions. But in this case, the 13th is fixed at P, so I need to figure out the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and this central charge, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, no, the potential energy of the entire system is the work done to bring each charge into its place, considering the existing charges that are already there. So for a system of charges, the potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

But in this case, there are two types of interactions: between the central charge and each of the 12 charges, and between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. Hmm, wait,
