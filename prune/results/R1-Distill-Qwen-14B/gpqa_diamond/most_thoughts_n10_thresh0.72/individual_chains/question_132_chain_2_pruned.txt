Okay, I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So, the problem is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their NMR spectra.

The molecular formula given is C10H14. Hmm, wait, let me think about the possible structures here. The options are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. So, each compound is probably a substituted benzene with four methyl groups. Except for option C, where one is diethyl, which has two ethyl groups instead of four methyl.

The NMR data is a bit tricky. The aromatic region shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each a singlet, and in a 1:1 ratio. Then, in the aliphatic region, around 2.2 ppm, there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Let me start by recalling what NMR signals look like for different substituents. For aromatic compounds, when there's symmetry, the protons can split into fewer signals. For example, para substitution leads to equivalent protons, so a singlet. Ortho and meta would have different splitting.

Wait, the aromatic region has two singlets. That suggests each compound has some equivalent aromatic protons that are deshielded around 6.7 ppm. So, maybe each compound is symmetrical in a way that the aromatic protons are equivalent, giving a singlet. Or perhaps each has two sets of equivalent protons, each giving a singlet, but since they're in a 1:1 ratio, they don't overlap.

Wait, no, the aromatic region has two signals, each a singlet, in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet, and their protons don't overlap. So each compound has a single type of aromatic proton, each as a singlet. So each must have equivalent aromatic protons.

Looking at the options, let's consider each.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (so that's 4 methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would imply a four-methyl group at the 1,2,3,4 positions on benzene. Hmmm, wait, benzene is a ring with six positions. So 1,2,3,4 would be a row of four consecutive positions. Wait, that would make it a 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl benzene, which is actually 1,2,3,4-tetra. Alternatively, maybe it's 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would be the same as 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl but with numbering shifted. Wait, no, because benzene is a ring.

Wait, no, but regardless, let me think about their structures.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: So the four methyl groups are at
