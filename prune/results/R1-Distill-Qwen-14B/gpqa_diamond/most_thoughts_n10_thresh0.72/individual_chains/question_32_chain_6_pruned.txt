Alright, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li is lithium. The standard notation would be Li-7 perhaps, since it has 3 neutrons. Wait, no. Wait, lithium has 3 protons normally, right? So Li-7 would have 7 nucleons: 3 protons + 4 neutrons. Oh wait, but the question says the nucleus has 3 neutrons. So the number of protons is 3, neutrons 3, so total nucleons are 6. That would make it Li-6, I think. Because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. But wait, sometimes isotopes are denoted as Li-6 and Li-7. So the nucleus in question is Li-6. So I need to find the energy of the particle when it's moving at 0.96c.

Wait, but in particle accelerators, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy, right? Or is it the total energy? I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions to relativistic speeds, so their total energy would be gamma * m cÂ², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So the first step is to find the rest
