Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I need to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup: An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are involved, which are matter and antimatter, their annihilation should result in energy in the form of photons.

Wait, but both particles are moving along the same line, the horizontal axis. So, the initial setup is along a straight line, but the photons are moving in some directions after the collision. Since the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right, their angles are measured from the right direction, perhaps. But wait, the initial motion was along the horizontal—so maybe the setup is along the x-axis.

I think I should model this using conservation laws. Both energy and momentum must be conserved in this process.

First, let's figure out the initial energies and momenta of the electron and positron.

The Lorentz factor (gamma) is given for each. For the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, gamma is 2.

Wait, but wait, the positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron. So, its mass is the same as the electron's, but charge is opposite. So both have rest mass energy of m*c², which is about 0.511 MeV, but the exact value might not matter if we're using ratios.

But wait, in terms of momentum, the relativistic momentum is calculated as gamma * m * v, but since we're using the Lorentz factor, maybe it's better to express momentum in terms of gamma.

Wait, another thought: The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after. Similarly, the total energy before must equal the total after.

So, let's compute the initial energy and momentum of each particle.

The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4. So, its gamma_e =4. The positron
