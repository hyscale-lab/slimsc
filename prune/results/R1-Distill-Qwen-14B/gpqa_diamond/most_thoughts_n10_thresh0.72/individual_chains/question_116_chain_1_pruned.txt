Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, A undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form compound C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. I need to identify compound D from the options given.

Alright, let's break this down. I'll start with the NMR data of compound A. So, proton NMR shows two signals. The first is a triplet integrating for 6H at 0.9 ppm. The second is a quartet for 4H at 1.3 ppm.

Hmm, 0.9 ppm triplet usually indicates methyl groups adjacent to some protons. The quartet at 1.3 suggests maybe a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, because a quartet often arises from coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but waitâ€”why would a quartet come from a CH2 next to another CH2?

Wait, let me think about splitting. If a proton has two neighboring groups, each with two protons, the splitting would be a quartet. Like in an ethyl group, -CH2CH2-. The protons on the adjacent CH2 would be split into a quartet. So, for example, in an ethyl group, the CH2 next to the CH3 would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet.

So if compound A's NMR shows a triplet for 6H, that suggests three CH3 groups? Or maybe one CH3 group that's split into a triplet. Wait, no, 6H in a triplet would mean two CH3 groups, each split into a triplet. Because each CH3 has 3H, so 2 CH3 would give 6H. Or wait, perhaps it's a single CH3 group with two neighboring groups? No, more likely, it's a ethyl group where each CH2 is next to another CH2, making quartet and triplet.

Wait, the triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm: if a triplet is from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, each CH2 has two H, so maybe it's a di-ethyl group or something similar. Or perhaps it's a (CH2CH3) group. Wait, more accurately, the triplet would be for a CH2 group next to another CH2, so for example, in an ethyl group, the CH2CH3: the CH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct myself. In an ethyl group, the CH2 adjacent to the CH3 (let's say it's CH2CH3) would have the CH2 protons split into a quartet because each H on the CH2 is next to the two H on the CH
