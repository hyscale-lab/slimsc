Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We're told to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Alright, let's break this down. First, let's get the masses of the two fragments. The initial mass is M, and the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99M. Let me call the masses m1 and m2, with m1 being the more massive one since it's twice as heavy as the other. So m1 = 2 * m2.

So, m1 + m2 = 0.99M. Substituting, 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99M → m2 = 0.99M /3 ≈ 0.33M. So m1 is 0.66M, and m2 is 0.33M.

But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. That means their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, p1 = -p2.

In the non-relativistic case, we can use conservation of momentum and kinetic energy. But the problem says to compare the correct (relativistic) T1 with the classical approximation. So I need to calculate both and find the difference.

Wait, but what's the correct way to calculate their kinetic energies? Let's think about energy conservation in both cases.

In the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies. But since the initial nucleus is at rest, the initial energy is just its rest mass energy: E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two fragments. Each fragment's total energy is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. So E_final = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2). 

But energy must be conserved, so E_initial = E_final. So:

M c² = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2)

Which simplifies to:

M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + T1 + T2.

We know that (m1 + m2) = 0.99 M, so substituting:

300 GeV = 0.99M c² + (T1 + T2)

So the kinetic energies sum to 300 GeV - 0.99 * M c². Wait, but M c² is 300 GeV, so 0.99 * 300 GeV is 297 GeV. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Wait, 3 GeV is 3000 MeV. That's a lot.

But I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of each fragment. Also, since momentum is conserved, p1 = -p2.

In non-relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). So for each fragment, T1 = p²/(2 m1) and T2 = p²/(2 m2). Since m1 is twice m2, T1 should be (p²)/(2*(2 m2)) )= p²/(4 m2), and T2 is p²/(2 m2). So T2 is twice T1.

So in the non-relativistic case, T1 = (p²)/(4 m2), T2 = (p²)/(2 m2) → T2 = 2 T1.

And since T1 + T2 = 3000 MeV (3 GeV), substituting gives T1 + 2 T1 =3 GeV → 3 T1 =3 GeV → T1 =1 GeV. Wait, that's 1000 MeV. So according to classical approximation, T1 is 1 GeV.

But wait, in reality, for relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is not (p²)/(2m), but (gamma -1) m c². Hmm, but how do I calculate the actual kinetic energy in the relativistic case?

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem using relativistic momentum and energy, but that might get complicated.

Let me think. Let's denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. Since they're moving in opposite directions, I'll take their velocities along the same line, say, v1 to the right and v2 to the left.

But momentum is conserved. So m1 v1 = m2 v2 (since the initial momentum is zero). Because m1 is twice m2, so 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 v1 = v2.

Wait, no: m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M. So m1 = 2 m2. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 v1 = v2. So v2 is twice v1.

But in reality, since the nucleus is moving relativistically, the velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, so relativistic effects can't be ignored. So we need to use the relativistic expressions for momentum and energy.

Let me denote the speed of each fragment as v1 and v2. From momentum conservation, the magnitude of their momenta are equal, so |p1| = |p2|.

In relativistic terms, p = gamma m v. So since m1 is twice m2, and |p1|=|p2|, we have gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But from the momentum conservation in terms of direction, p1 = -p2 → (gamma1 m1 v1) = - (gamma2 m2 v2). But since speed is a magnitude, perhaps the velocities are in opposite directions, so the signs differ.

But perhaps it's easier to consider the magnitudes. So gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

From the earlier non-relativistic case, we have v2 = 2 v1. But that's only valid in the non-relativistic limit. In reality, velocities may not follow this because of relativistic effects.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should approach it using energy and momentum conservation with relativistic equations.

Let me denote the rest masses as m1 and m2. We know m1 = 2 m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.

The initial energy is E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, each fragment has rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E1 = gamma1 m1 c² and E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

Total energy E_initial = E1 + E2 = gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c².

Momentum p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Conservation of momentum: p1 + p2 =0 → gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

Assuming v1 and v2 are in opposite directions, their signs would make p1 = - p2.

So, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since m1 = 2 m2, this becomes gamma1 * 2 m2 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Hmm, so 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2. But the velocities are related in a way that depends on gamma.

I think I'll need to find expressions for gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of each other.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the velocities using the fact that the kinetic energy must be considered.

Wait, but this might get too involved. Let me think if there's another approach. Since the system is isolated and the initial momentum is zero, the two fragments must move with equal and opposite momenta. So, perhaps I can express gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of their velocities and masses and set up equations.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the invariant quantity in relativity. The rest frame energy squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. Since initial momentum is zero, E_initial = M c².

After fission, E_total^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

But since p1 = -p2, p1 c + p2 c =0. So E_total = E1 + E2 = M c².

Which we already knew.

Hmm. Maybe another approach is needed. Let me consider the kinetic energies. The kinetic energy for each fragment is (gamma -1) m c².

So T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²,

T2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

We know that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV (since 300 GeV - 0.99 *300 GeV = 3 GeV).

So,

(gamma1 -1) m1 c² + (gamma2 -1) m2 c² = 3 GeV.

But m1 is 0.66 M, m2 0.33 M.

So,

(gamma1 -1) * 0.66 M c² + (gamma2 -1) * 0.33 M c² = 3 GeV.

But M c² is 300 GeV, so 0.66 M c² = 198 GeV, and 0.33 M c² is 99 GeV.

Substituting,

198 (gamma1 -1) + 99 (gamma2 -1) = 3.

Which simplifies to:

198 gamma1 -198 +99 gamma2 -99 =3.

Combine terms:

198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 =3 + 198 +99 → 3 + 297=300.

So, 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 = 300 → 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 = 300 GeV.

Divide both sides by 99:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 300 /99 → 300 /99 is approximately 3.0303.

Wait, 300 divided by 99 is 3.0303... Let me compute that exactly.

Wait, 99 *3=297, so 300=99*3 +3 → 300/99 =3 +3/99 =3 +1/33 ≈3.0303.

So, 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

But from the momentum conservation equation, earlier:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

We know m1 =2 m2, so:

gamma1 *2 m2 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Hmm, so gamma2 v2 = 2 gamma1 v1.

But v2 is in the opposite direction, so perhaps we can write v2 = - k v1, where k is a positive number. Wait, but in terms of speed, |v2|=k |v1|.

Wait, but from the non-relativistic case, we have v2 =2 v1. But that's only when velocities are small. In reality, velocities are probably a significant fraction of c, so this might not hold.

I think I need another equation involving gamma1 and gamma2.

We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, gamma1 =1/ sqrt(1 - (v1/c)^2 ), gamma2=1/ sqrt(1 - (v2/c)^2 ).

But from momentum conservation, perhaps we can express v2 in terms of v1.

Wait, earlier we have 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

So, v2 = (2 gamma1 v1) / gamma2.

But substituting into the expression for gamma2, which depends on v2, this could get quite complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express v2 in terms of v1 and the gammas.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's denote beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

So, beta1 and beta2 are fractions of the speed of light.

From momentum conservation: 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

Because m1 = 2 m2, the equation becomes:

gamma1 * 2 m2 beta1 c = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

Dividing both sides by m2 c,

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

So,

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

But also, for each fragment, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So,

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta2^2),

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta1^2).

Putting it all together,

[1 / sqrt(1 - beta2^2)] * beta2 = 2 [1 / sqrt(1 - beta1^2)] * beta1.

Hmm, this looks a bit messy, but maybe we can square both sides to simplify.

Squaring both sides,

( beta2^2 ) / (1 - beta2^2 ) = 4 ( beta1^2 ) / (1 - beta1^2 ).

Let me denote x = beta1^2 and y = beta2^2.

Then the equation becomes:

y/(1 - y) =4 x/(1 - x).

Which rearranges to:

y (1 -x ) =4 x (1 - y )

y (1 -x) =4x (1 - y )

Expanding:

y -x y =4x -4 x y.

Bring all terms to left:

y -x y -4x +4x y =0 → y (1 +3x) -4x =0.

So,

y= (4x)/(1 +3x).

But from the earlier equation, we have another relation. Let me see.

We have the equation from the kinetic energy sum:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

But gamma1 =1/sqrt(1 -x ), gamma2=1/sqrt(1 - y ).

So,

2 [1/sqrt(1 -x ) ] + [1/sqrt(1 - y ) ] =3.0303.

But since y=4x/(1 +3x), we can substitute that into this equation.

Let me substitute y into the equation.

So,

2 / sqrt(1 - x) + 1 / sqrt(1 - [4x/(1+3x)] ) =3.0303.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can find x numerically.

Let me denote A = 1 -x,

and B= 1 - [4x/(1+3x)] = [ (1+3x) -4x ]/(1+3x) )= (1 -x)/(1+3x).

So,

B = (1 -x)/(1 +3x).

So,

sqrt(1 - y ) = sqrt( B ) = sqrt( (1 -x)/(1 +3x) ) = sqrt(A) * sqrt( (1)/(1+3x) ) )

Wait, perhaps I can express the second term as sqrt(A) / sqrt(1+3x).

But this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption about x and see if it holds.

Alternatively, let me try to approximate. Since 3.0303 is about 3, perhaps gamma1 and gamma2 are close to 1. Wait, no, because if gamma1 is 1, then gamma2 would be 3.0303 - 2*1 =1.0303. Hmm, that might not be a bad assumption. Let me test.

Assume gamma1 ≈ 1, so T1 ≈0. But wait, from the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass energy of the fragment. Wait, m1 c² is 0.66 *300 GeV =198 GeV. So, T1 is 1 GeV, which is about 0.5% of 198 GeV. So, T1 is small compared to rest mass, so perhaps gamma1 is approximately 1 + (T1)/(m1 c² ) ≈ 1 + (1 GeV)/(198 GeV) ≈1.005. Similarly for gamma2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the velocities are non-relativistic, but the problem says to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical approximation. So perhaps the relativistic effects are not that big. Maybe the difference is small, so the relativistic T1 is slightly higher or lower than the classical one.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV. So, what's the correct T1?

Alternatively, maybe I can model the problem using the invariant mass and energy, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total energy is Mc²=300 GeV.

After fission, the two fragments have rest masses 0.66M and 0.33M, so their rest energies are 0.66*300=198 GeV and 0.33*300=99 GeV, totaling 297 GeV. The kinetic energy is 3 GeV as calculated earlier.

In the non-relativistic case, each fragment's KE is (p²)/(2m). So, for fragment 1, T1= p²/(2*(0.66 M)), and fragment 2, T2= p²/(2*(0.33 M)). But since m1=2 m2, T2=2 T1.

So, T1 + T2= 3 T1=3 GeV → T1=1 GeV.

But in reality, because of relativistic effects, the kinetic energy is higher or lower?

Wait, in reality, when considering relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is higher than the non-relativistic value because the gamma factor is greater than 1. But wait, in this case, the kinetic energy comes from the binding energy, which is 3 GeV. So is the KE in the relativistic case higher or lower?

Wait, the initial energy is 300 GeV. The combined rest mass of the fragments is 297 GeV, so the available binding energy is 3 GeV. But because the fragments are moving, their kinetic energy comes from that binding energy.

But in reality, the relativistic kinetic energy is not just (p²)/(2m), but (gamma -1) mc². So perhaps the actual kinetic energies are higher because the (gamma-1) factor is more than the (p²/(2m)) factor.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, KE is (p²)/(2m) ≈ (gamma-1) mc² for low velocities. So, if the fragments are moving at speeds where relativistic effects are significant, their KE would be higher than the non-relativistic estimate.

But how to calculate the exact T1?

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem using the center of momentum frame.

Wait, since the initial nucleus is at rest, the center of momentum frame is the same as the lab frame. So after fission, the two fragments move with opposite momenta. 

Another thought: perhaps I can use the relation between their energies and momenta.

For each fragment, E² = (pc)² + (m c² )².

So,

E1² = (p c )² + (m1 c² )²,

E2² = (p c )² + (m2 c² )².

Because p1 = p (magnitude) and p2 = p (same magnitude) but opposite direction, so their magnitudes are the same.

Wait no: in reality, the more massive fragment has lower momentum if they have the same kinetic energy. But in the non-relativistic case, the more massive has lower speed, so same p.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused here. Let's think again.

Each fragment has momentum p1 and p2, but p1 = -p2.

Thus, |p1|=|p2|=p.

So, E1² = (p c )^2 + (m1 c² )^2,

E2² = (p c )^2 + (m2 c² )^2.

The total energy is E1 + E2 = M c² =300 GeV.

So,

sqrt( (p c )^2 + (198 GeV )^2 ) + sqrt( (p c )^2 + (99 GeV )^2 ) =300 GeV.

Hmm, this looks like a challenging equation to solve for p. But perhaps I can make an approximation.

Let me denote x = p c.

So,

sqrt(x² +198² ) + sqrt(x² +99² ) =300.

Let me compute sqrt(x² +198² ) =300 - sqrt(x² +99² ).

Let me square both sides:

x² +198² = [300 - sqrt(x² +99² ) ]².

Expanding the right side:

=300² - 2*300 * sqrt(x² +99² ) + (x² +99² )

So,

x² + 39204 =90000 -600 sqrt(x² +9801) +x² + 9801.

Simplify:

x² cancels out.

39204 =90000 +9801 -600 sqrt(x² +9801).

Compute 90000 +9801=99801.

39204 =99801 -600 sqrt(...).

Subtract 99801 from both sides:

39204 -99801 = -600 sqrt(...).

Left side: 39204 -99801= -60597.

So,

-60597 = -600 sqrt(x² +9801).

Multiply both sides by (-1):

60597 =600 sqrt(x² +9801).

Divide both sides by 600:

60597 /600 ≈ 100.995 ≈ sqrt(x² +9801).

Square both sides:

(100.995)^2 ≈ x² +9801.

Compute 100.995^2: Let me approximate.

100^2=10000.

100.995^2 = (100 + 0.995)^2 = 100^2 + 2 *100 *0.995 + (0.995)^2.

=10000 + 199 + approx 0.990025.

So, 10199.990025.

So,

10199.990025 ≈ x² +9801 → x² ≈ 10199.990025 -9801 = 398.990025.

So, x ≈ sqrt(398.990025 ) ≈19.97475 GeV.

So, x= p c ≈19.97475 GeV.

So, p ≈19.97475 GeV /c.

Now, compute the kinetic energies.

For fragment 1:

E1 = sqrt( (19.97475)^2 +198^2 ) GeV.

Compute 19.97475^2: approx (20)^2=400, but 19.97475 is about 20 -0.02525. So (20 -0.02525)^2 =400 - 2*20*0.02525 + (0.02525)^2 ≈400 - 1.01 + 0.000638 ≈398.9906.

So, E1 = sqrt(398.9906 + 198² ).

198^2=39204.

So, E1^2= 398.9906 +39204 =39602.9906.

E1 = sqrt(39602.9906 ) GeV ≈199 GeV.

Similarly, for fragment 2:

E2 = sqrt( (19.97475)^2 +99^2 ) → (19.97475)^2 is ~398.99, 99^2=9801.

So, E2^2= 398.99 +9801=10200 → E2=100.995 GeV.

So, E1 ≈199 GeV, E2≈100.995 GeV.

Thus, T1 = E1 - m1 c² =199 GeV -198 GeV=1 GeV.

T2= E2 - m2 c²=100.995 GeV -99 GeV=1.995 GeV.

Wait, but earlier the sum of T1 and T2 should be 3 GeV. 1 +1.995=2.995≈3 GeV. So that checks out.

Wait, but this is the relativistic calculation. So T1=1 GeV.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, T1 is also 1 GeV. So the difference would be zero? But that can't be right because the options don't include zero. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Because in the above calculation, the E1 and E2 came out to be exactly 199 and 100.995, which gave T1=1 GeV. But I think I might have made an assumption that the kinetic energy is (E - rest energy), which is correct. But wait, the initial approach in the non-relativistic case also gave T1=1 GeV. So according to this, the relativistic and non-relativistic T1 are the same. But that can't be right because the relativistic calculation should give a different result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, from the equation for E1 and E2, when I substituted, I got E1=199 GeV, which is just 1 GeV above its rest mass (198 GeV), so T1=1 GeV. Similarly, E2=100.995 GeV, rest is 99 GeV → T2=1.995 GeV.

So the sum is 1 +1.995=2.995 GeV, which is approximately 3 GeV. So that works. But then, in this case, the relativistic T1 is 1 GeV, same as the non-relativistic case. So the difference is zero. But the options don't have zero, so I must have done something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is incorrect. Maybe the assumption that p1 = p2 is correct, but in reality, maybe the velocities are higher, leading to different KEs.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the relativistic calculation, the KE is (gamma-1) mc², which for p c = ~20 GeV and m c²=198 GeV, gives gamma as sqrt( (20)^2 +198^2 ) /198 ≈ sqrt(400 +39204)/198 → sqrt(39604)=199 → gamma=199/198≈1.00505.

So, gamma-1=0.00505. Thus, T1= (gamma-1) m1 c²=0.00505 *198 GeV≈1 GeV.

Similarly for fragment 2: p c=20 GeV, m2 c²=99 GeV → gamma= sqrt(20^2 +99^2 )/99 → sqrt(400 +9801)=sqrt(10201)=101 → gamma=101/99≈1.0202. So gamma-1=0.0202. Thus, T2=0.0202 *99 GeV≈2 GeV.

So, T1=1 GeV, T2=2 GeV. Sum is 3 GeV. So that's correct.

But in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV and T2 is 2 GeV, same as the relativistic calculation. So the KEs are the same in both cases. Thus, the difference is zero. But the options don't have that.

Hmm, that's confusing. But the problem says to find the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation. If both are the same, the difference is zero. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made an error in the setup.

Wait, perhaps in the non-relativistic calculation, the kinetic energies are T1=1 GeV and T2=2 GeV, but in reality, the correct (relativistic) T1 is higher or lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the non-relativistic case. Let me recompute it.

In the non-relativistic case, the two fragments have masses m1=0.66 M and m2=0.33 M.

Because the initial momentum is zero, the momenta after fission must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Because m1=2 m2 → 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2=2 v1.

The kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

So,

T1= (1/2) m1 v1²,

T2= (1/2) m2 v2² = (1/2)(0.33 M)(2 v1 )² = (1/2)(0.33 M)(4 v1² )=0.66 M v1².

Then, T1 + T2= (0.5 *0.66 M v1² ) + (0.66 M v1² ) = (0.33 M v1² ) + 0.66 M v1² =0.99 M v1².

But the total KE is 3 GeV=3000 MeV.

So,

0.99 M v1² =3000 MeV → v1² = (3000 MeV )/(0.99 M ).

But M c² =300 GeV=300,000 MeV.

So,

v1²= (3000 )/(0.99 *300000 ) → 3000 /297000 ≈0.0101 → v1²≈0.0101 → v1≈0.1 c.

So, v1 is 0.1c, v2=0.2 c.

Now, compute T1 and T2.

T1=(1/2) *0.66 M * (0.1 c )^2.

But M c²=300 GeV.

So,

(1/2) *0.66 M * (0.01 c² )=0.33 * M c² *0.01 =0.33 *300 GeV *0.01=0.33 *3 GeV=0.99 GeV≈1 GeV.

Similarly, T2=0.66 M (0.1 c )^2=0.66 *300 GeV *0.01=0.66 *3 GeV=1.98 GeV≈2 GeV.

So, T1 is 1 GeV in both cases. So the difference is zero, which isn't among the options. Hmm, but the options are A) 2 MeV, B)5 MeV, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me think again. In the relativistic case, we found T1=1 GeV. But perhaps that's not correct because when we solved for E1 and E2, we assumed that the same p applies to both, but perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, another approach: the system's total energy is 300 GeV. The rest mass energy of the two fragments is 297 GeV. The kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is the total KE.

In the non-relativistic case, T1=1 GeV, T2=2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, perhaps the KE is same, but the distribution is different. Wait, but our earlier calculation suggested it's the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the relativistic calculation gives a different distribution. So perhaps the relativistic T1 is different.

Wait, but according to the calculation, in both cases T1 is 1 GeV. So the difference is zero. But the options don't have zero.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the initial setup. Let me re-examine the relativistic calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the relativistic case, the energy isn't just E1 + E2 =300 GeV. Because the initial nucleus is at rest, E_initial = Mc² =300 GeV.

After fission, E1 + E2 =300 GeV.

Each E is gamma m c², so:

gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c²=300 GeV.

Also, from momentum conservation: p1 = -p2.

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

So, gamma1 m1 v1 = -gamma2 m2 v2.

Assuming v1 and v2 are in opposite directions, their magnitudes are v1 and v2, so gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But m1=2 m2 → gamma1 *2 m2 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

So, v2 = (2 gamma1 v1 ) / gamma2.

But since v2 is in terms of v1, and gamma relates to v, this is complicated.

Alternatively, let's consider that in the center of momentum frame, but since the nucleus is at rest, that's the same frame.

Wait, another approach: let me consider that the kinetic energy comes from the binding energy. So the available energy is 3 GeV. But how is this distributed between the two fragments?

Wait, the non-relativistic case gives T1=1 GeV, which is about 0.5% of m1 c² (198 GeV). So the velocities are low, and relativistic effects are minimal. Thus, the relativistic T1 is very close to the classical value, so the difference is small, maybe a few MeV.

But according to the earlier calculation, the relativistic T1 is exactly 1 GeV, same as the classical case. So why are the options suggesting a difference of several MeV?

Wait, maybe the mistake is that in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (gamma-1) m c², but perhaps I missed some terms.

Wait, no, the KE is definitely (gamma -1) m c². So in the relativistic case, with gamma=1.005, T1=0.00505 *198 GeV=1.0099 GeV, which is approximately 1.01 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, T1=1 GeV. So the difference is about 0.01 GeV=10 MeV. So the correct answer would be 10 MeV.

Wait, that makes sense. Because in the relativistic case, the KE is slightly higher.

Wait, let me compute the exact value.

In the relativistic case, T1= (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

We found that for fragment 1, gamma1=199/198≈1.0050505.

So, gamma1 -1=0.0050505.

m1 c²=198 GeV.

So T1=0.0050505 *198 GeV= (0.0050505 *198 ) GeV.

Compute 0.0050505 *198:

0.005 *198=0.99 GeV.

0.0000505 *198= approx 0.01 GeV.

So total is approx 1.00 GeV.

Wait, that's exactly the same as the non-relativistic case. So the difference is zero.

But I'm getting conflicting results. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation where E1 was 199 GeV, which is 1 GeV above rest mass. So T1=1 GeV.

But in reality, perhaps gamma1 is slightly larger, leading to a slightly larger T1.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that p1 = p2 is correct, but perhaps in reality, the p is higher.

Wait, perhaps I need to do a more precise calculation of the equation.

Earlier, I approximated sqrt( x² +198² ) + sqrt( x² +99² )=300.

I found x≈19.97475 GeV.

But perhaps a more precise calculation is needed.

Wait, let's solve the equation sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) =300, where a= x²+198² and b=x²+99².

Let me let y =x².

Then,

sqrt(y +198² ) + sqrt(y +99² ) =300.

Let me denote:

A = sqrt(y +198² ),

B = sqrt(y +99² ).

So, A + B =300.

But A² - B² = (y +198²) - (y +99²) )=198² -99² = (198-99)(198+99 )=99 *297=29403.

So, A² - B²=29403.

But A=300 - B.

So,

(300 - B )² - B² =29403.

Expand (300-B)^2 =90000 -600 B + B².

So,

90000 -600 B + B² - B² =29403 → 90000 -600 B =29403.

600 B =90000 -29403=60597.

So, B=60597 /600 =100.995.

Thus, A=300 -100.995=199.005.

Now, A= sqrt(y +198² )=199.005 → y +198² = (199.005 )².

Compute 199.005²:

= (200 -0.995 )² =200² - 2*200*0.995 + (0.995 )²=40000 -398 +0.990025=39602.090025.

y +198²=39602.090025 → y=39602.090025 -198².

Compute 198^2=39204.

So, y=39602.090025 -39204=398.090025.

So, y=398.090025 → x= sqrt(y )=sqrt(398.090025 )=19.9522 GeV.

So, x= p c=19.9522 GeV.

Now, compute E1 and E2.

E1 = sqrt( (19.9522 )^2 +198^2 )=sqrt(398.090025 +39204 )=sqrt(39602.090025 )=199.005 GeV.

E1 - m1 c²=199.005 -198=1.005 GeV.

So, T1=1.005 GeV=1005 MeV.

In the non-relativistic case, T1=1 GeV=1000 MeV.

So the difference is 1005 -1000=5 MeV.

Ah! So the correct T1 is 1.005 GeV, and the classical approximation gives 1 GeV. So the difference is 5 MeV.

So the correct answer is 5 MeV. Which corresponds to option B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and non-relativistic mechanics. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV and splits into two fragments with rest masses 0.66M and 0.33M, where M is the initial mass. The total rest mass of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass, leaving 3 GeV of energy available as kinetic energy for the two fragments.

### Key Calculations:

1. **Rest Mass Energies of the Fragments**:
   - Fragment 1 (more massive): \( m_1 c^2 = 0.66 \times 300 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Fragment 2 (less massive): \( m_2 c^2 = 0.33 \times 300 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \)

2. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The total momentum before and after the fission must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the two fragments are equal: \( p_1 = p_2 = p \).

3. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:
   - The total energy after fission is the sum of the total energies of the two fragments:
     \[
     E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV},
     \]
     where \( E_1 = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_1^2 c^4} \) and \( E_2 = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_2^2 c^4} \).

4. **Kinetic Energy Distribution**:
   - The total kinetic energy is the energy available after accounting for the rest mass energy:
     \[
     T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV},
     \]
     where \( T_1 = E_1 - m_1 c^2 \) and \( T_2 = E_2 - m_2 c^2 \).

5. **Non-Relativistic Approximation**:
   - In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{p^2}{2m} \). Using momentum conservation:
     \[
     T_1 = \frac{p^2}{2m_1}, \quad T_2 = \frac{p^2}{2m_2}.
     \]
     Since \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), it follows that \( T_2 = 2T_1 \). Solving \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \) gives:
     \[
     T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV}, \quad T_2 = 2 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

6. **Relativistic Calculation**:
   - Solving the relativistic energy and momentum equations yields:
     \[
     p \approx 19.9522 \, \text{GeV}/c.
     \]
     Substituting into the relativistic energy expressions:
     \[
     E_1 = \sqrt{(19.9522)^2 + 198^2} \approx 199.005 \, \text{GeV}, \quad E_2 = \sqrt{(19.9522)^2 + 99^2} \approx 100.995 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]
     The kinetic energies are:
     \[
     T_1 = E_1 - m_1 c^2 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV}, \quad T_2 = E_2 - m_2 c^2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

7. **Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)**:
   - In the non-relativistic case, \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \). In the relativistic case, \( T_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:
     \[
     \Delta T_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The difference between the correct relativistic \( T_1 \) and the non-relativistic approximation is **5 MeV**.
