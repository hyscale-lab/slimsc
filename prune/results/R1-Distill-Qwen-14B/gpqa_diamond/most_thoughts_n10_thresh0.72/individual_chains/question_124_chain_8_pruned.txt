Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Right now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The question is asking, what Lorentz factor would be needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls instead?

Hmm, okay, so the key here seems to be the relationship between the particles' speed (or their Lorentz factor) and the time they take to travel to the detector's walls. Because if they decay before reaching the wall, they wouldn't be detected. So, the fraction that makes it to the walls depends on their speed, which affects how quickly they can reach the wall before decaying.

Wait, but how does the Lorentz factor relate to this? Let me recall. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So a higher gamma means the particle is moving closer to the speed of light.

In the problem, when the Lorentz factor is 20, only one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So, I'm thinking that the ones that reach the walls must have a longer lifetime in the detector's frame of reference than the others. Because if their lifetime (proper time) is longer, or if time dilation makes their lifetime longer from our frame, they have a higher chance to reach the walls before decaying.

Wait, the decay is fast, so the particles don't live for very long. So the time they have to travel before decaying is important. The mean lifetime from our (lab) frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau), right? So gamma * tau is their lifetime in our frame.

The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by their velocity. The distance is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. Oh wait, from the center, so it's 30 meters. But since they're moving at relativistic speeds, v is approximately c, but I'll have to be precise.

So, the time to reach the wall is t = 30 m / v. But wait, v is a significant fraction of c. Let's let v be beta*c, where beta is v/c. So beta is close to 1 for relativistic speeds. Then, t = 30/(beta*c) seconds.

The lifetime in our frame is gamma * tau. The particle will reach the wall if t is less than gamma * tau. Because if the time it takes to reach the wall is less than its lifetime, then it doesn't decay before getting there.

So the condition is t < gamma * tau.

But wait, for
