Alright, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrophilic substitution reactions. Let's take a deep breath and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic substitution reaction when various substituents are attached to a benzene ring. The substances are 1 to 6, each with a different substituent. They're reacting with excess bromine, and we're to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to certain positionsâ€”ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, so the para-isomer's yield depends on the directing effect of the substituent. Activating groups direct ortho/para, while deactivating groups are meta directors. But wait, not all deactivating groups are meta directors. Some, like nitro groups, are strong deactivating and meta-directing, while others might be differently oriented.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each substituent, I need to figure out how much para product forms compared to the others. But some substituents might have a strong directing effect, leading to more para product.

Let me list out each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The CH3 group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So, the incoming Br would go to ortho, para positions. If the substitution is monobromination, then the major product would be a mix of ortho and para. Since the ring is symmetric, the para product would be significant. But wait, in toluene, the para isomer is more stable and usually the major product because of steric factors? Or maybe because the activating groups favor more para substitution? Hmm, I think in toluene, the para isomer is usually more dominant compared to ortho because of steric hindrance in the ortho position. So, the para would form more, making its weight fraction higher.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: This looks like phenyl acetate. The substituent is an ester group, OCOEt. Esters are deactivating because the oxygen is electron-withdrawing. But wait, the ester group has an electron-donating effect through resonance? Or is it an overall deactivating group? Wait, the ester group is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So, the substituent is deactivating (so the ring is less reactive) and directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So, for this substituent, the para product would be formed, but the ring is less reactive, so the overall yield might be lower. But the question is about the proportion of para in the products. So, since it's an ortho/para director, the para would be a major product, but perhaps more than in the case of activating groups?

Wait, but wait. The ring's activation affects the rate of
