Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and some properties of compounds. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question has two parts: part A and part B. Let me tackle them one by one.

Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a double bond, leading to different structures. So, for a compound to show tautomerism, it must have a structure that allows this kind of shift. 

Benzoquinone â€“ I think benzoquinone can have two tautomers. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So, it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. In such a structure, can it undergo tautomerism? I'm a bit confused. Wait, tautomerism usually requires adjacent carbonyl groups or something like that. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize because the two carbonyl groups might allow for some shifting. Or perhaps not. Wait, benzoquinone is a diketone, but I'm not sure if it's capable of enol tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe it's more about whether the structure allows for keto-enol tautomerism. 

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Let's visualize it: it's a cyclohexane ring with ketones at positions 1,3,5. So, each of those is a carbonyl group. Now, if the molecule has conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe it can undergo some kind of tautomerism. But wait, for tautomerism, typically you need an adjacent group that can accept a hydrogen. So, if all the carbonyl groups are conjugated, maybe there's no place for a hydrogen shift because they're all in conjugation. 

Wait, another thought: tautomerism usually involves the transfer of a hydrogen and the shift of double bonds. For example, in a diketone, maybe it can form an enol. But in the case of a trione, with three carbonyl groups, perhaps the structure doesn
