Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology techniques, specifically involving transmembrane receptors and ligands, and their expression using certain vectors. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

So, the setup is that a new ligand-receptor pair is identified in neural crest cells, and we want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular ones, and three beta sheets for binding the ligand. The ligand itself is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices. 

Then, the vector setup: it's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end and fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter used for expression in various tissues. The receptor has an IRES upstream of it. 

Wait, IRES elements are Internal Ribosome Entry Sites. They allow for the translation of the second gene in a bicistronic vector without the need for a second promoter. So the first gene (ligand) is under CBA, and IRES drives the translation of the second gene (receptor). 

Now, between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. And between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop cassette with lox2272. Oh, right, these are specific lox sites used in Cre/LoxP recombination. LoxP is recognized by Cre, while lox2272 is recognized by another recombinase, maybe Flp or something else? Or perhaps it's a different variant. Wait, I think lox2272 is a variant that's more efficiently recognized by Cre compared to loxP? Or maybe it's the reverse? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

So, the vector is set up so that when Cre is expressed, it will recombine the lox sites. If the mouse is Cre-positive, the stop cassettes would be excised, allowing the expression of both the ligand (with mCherry) and the receptor (with eGFP). 

The researcher created this construct and transfected primary astrocyte cultures. Then, they checked Western blot using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. The blot shows a signal proportional to actin, which I think is just a loading control. 

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. So the mice have both alleles of this bicistronic vector. Next, they crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, right? So the Cre here is probably under the control of SOX10 regulatory elements, meaning it's expressed in neural crest-derived cells. 

The offspring would have the Cre gene active in neural crest cells. So when Cre is expressed, it should excise the stop cassettes, allowing both the ligand and receptor to be expressed along with their respective fluorescent tags. 

But when they looked under the confocal microscope, there was no green signal. eGFP is green, and the receptor is fused to it. So why no green?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the Cre is working, the eGFP should be expressed, regardless of whether the ligand-receptor is paracrine or autocrine. So this seems unrelated to the expression of the fluorescent proteins. So maybe not A.

Option B: receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface. But why would it not be expressed at all? The Western blot probably showed expression, otherwise, maybe no signal. But the question says the blot showed signals proportional to actin, but I'm not sure if that implies the proteins are expressed. Wait, the blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. If the construct is expressed, you'd see bands. But the question says the blot is fine, so the issue is elsewhere. If the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi, maybe it's not expressed on the cell surface, but in the Western blot, which uses total proteins, you'd still see the protein. So perhaps the blot shows the receptor is present, but it's not on the surface, so you don't see it in the fluorescence. But the question says that in the mouse model, after Cre is active, they look for eGFP and see nothing.
