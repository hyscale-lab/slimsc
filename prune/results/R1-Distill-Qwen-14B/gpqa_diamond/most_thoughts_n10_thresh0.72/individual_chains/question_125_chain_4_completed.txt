Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r², which I remember is the form for a harmonic oscillator. The particle is moving in this potential, and I need to find the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy level.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all three dimensions, so the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z.

Wait, actually, I think the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. Or wait, no. Let me think again. Oh right, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number n_i, and the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So the energy depends on the sum N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each of the n_i can be 0, 1, 2, etc.

So, the ground state is when all n_i are zero. So N = 0. The first excited state would be when N=1, because that's the next possible energy level. Then N=2 is the second excited state, and N=3 is the third excited state. Wait, no. Wait, ground state is the lowest, so when N=0, that's the ground state. First excited is N=1 (one quantum), second excited is N=2, third excited is N=3. So the third excited state is when N=3.

Wait, but wait, sometimes people count the energy levels as starting from zero. So the ground state is the first energy level, then first excited is second, etc. Hmm, confusing. Let me make sure. Let's see: the ground state is N=0 (so E = 3/2 ħω), first excited state is N=1 (E=5/2 ħω), second excited is N=2 (E=7/2 ħω), third excited is N=3 (E=9/2 ħω). So the third excited state has energy (9/2) ħω, which is option A or C.

Now the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, what is the degeneracy of the energy level when N=3.

Wait, the degeneracy occurs because different combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) can give the same sum N. So for a given N, how many distinct triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) are possible, where each n_i is a non-negative integer and n_x + n_y + n_z = N.

In this case, N=3. So how many ways can three integers add up to 3, where each is >=0? That's a combinatorics problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

I remember the formula for the number of solutions is (N + 3 -1) choose (3-1) ), which is (3 + 2) choose 2 = 5 choose 2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking at the options again:

Option A says energy (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. That matches both parts.

Option C says same energy but 3 eigenfunctions, which doesn't make sense because I calculated 10.

Option B and D have energy expressions involving pi² and r², which doesn't fit the harmonic oscillator formula I know. I think those are probably for other potentials, like Coulomb or something else.

So the correct answer should be option A: energy (9/2) ħω, 10 eigenfunctions.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ moving in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of such a system are quantized and given by $E = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$, where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. Here, $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively.

The ground state corresponds to $N = 0$ (lowest energy), the first excited state to $N = 1$, the second excited state to $N = 2$, and the third excited state to $N = 3$. For $N = 3$, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the degeneracy of the energy level corresponds to the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. This is determined by the number of distinct combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy $n_x + n_y + n_z = N$. For $N = 3$, the number of solutions is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Number of solutions} = \binom{N + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the degeneracy is 10, meaning there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Correct, as it states the energy is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and the degeneracy is 10.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it provides an energy expression involving $\pi^2$ and $r^2$, which is not valid for a harmonic oscillator.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it states the degeneracy is 3, which is inconsistent with the calculation.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it provides an energy expression involving $\pi^2$ and $r^2$, which is not valid for a harmonic oscillator.

The correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
