Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product is. Let me take it step by step.

First, the starting material is benzene. Then, benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. Oh right, that's a nitrating mixture. So, benzene undergoes nitration. The nitration of benzene typically adds a nitro group. Where does it attach? Well, the nitronium ion is a strong meta director, but wait, benzene is symmetric, so the nitro group can go in any position, but the major product is meta, but maybe in this case, since there's only one substituent, the nitration would add a nitro group in the meta position relative to itself. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so maybe it's para? No, wait, nitration is a meta-directing group. Wait, no, nitro is a strong meta director. Wait, benzene is being nitrated, so product 1 is nitrobenzene. But wait, nitro is meta directing, but in nitration, the first product would be nitrobenzene, which has the nitro group in a single position. Oh, but wait, benzene is symmetric, so no positional isomerism here. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, but nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene, which is a single product. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Hmm, so Br2 with iron. Oh, that's probably a bromination reaction. Iron and bromine usually catalyze substitution reactions. But wait, the presence of Fe is important. Oh, wait, when you have a di or poly-substituted benzene, the position matters, but in nitrobenzene, which substituent directs the incoming bromine?

Nitro is a strong meta director. So when you brominate nitrobenzene, the bromine will add in the meta position relative to the nitro group. So the nitro group is at position 1 (let's number it), so bromine would enter at position 3 or 5. But wait, nitro is meta directing, so the next substituent would be at the meta position. So the structure would be 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene. So product 2 is 3
