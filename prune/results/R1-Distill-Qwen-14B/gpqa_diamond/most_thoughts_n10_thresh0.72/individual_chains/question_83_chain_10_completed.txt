Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you titrate an acid with a base, the pH depends on how much base has been added. At 25% titration, it's a quarter of the way to the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized.

First, I need to find out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The moles of acetic acid initially are Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, the concentration would be moles / total volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol (from earlier). So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point volume is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration, so that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³.

But actually, the way I think about it, when someone says 25% titration, they mean 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So in this case, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So for the 25% titration point, let's calculate the pH.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's think about the reaction.

The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. Adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, this will neutralize 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate ion. The remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

So the solution now has 0.00075 mol of CH3COOH and 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

The total volume is initial (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is around 4.735 (since 1e-5 is 5, 1.85 is closer to 2, so 4.73 or 4.74).

Wait, let's compute it more accurately: log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

What's the ratio? 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Option B is 3.17 and something. Hmm, so 4.26 is in option A, but let's think about the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted into acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point: the moles of acetate is 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

But wait, that's a very small Kb, so the hydrolysis won't produce a lot of OH- ions. So the pH will be slightly basic, but not very high.

To find the pH, we can set up the expression for Kb.

Let x be the concentration of OH- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate denominator as 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5, so pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

Thus, pH ≈ 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C) 4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of these match. So either I made a mistake in calculations or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations for the equivalence point.

Wait, wait. Another approach: when you have a sodium acetate solution, the pH can be calculated using the formula for the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

But maybe I should compute it more accurately without approximation.

The Kb expression is x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, but let me check:

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x) ≈ 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

Which is about 1e-5, so 0.02 is 0.02, so x is 1e-5, which is 0.001% of 0.02, so the assumption holds.

So x is ~1.04e-5, pOH is ~4.98, pH is ~9.02.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, maybe the molarity calculations were wrong.

Wait, let me recheck the initial moles of acetic acid.

Original volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Then when diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles NaOH = 0.001 mol.

So volume NaOH is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Correct.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ NaOH added, which is 0.00025 mol NaOH.

So moles of HA (acetic acid) remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of A^- (acetate): 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.735. Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is about -0.477, so pH is 4.735 - 0.477 ≈ 4.258, which rounds to 4.26.

So the pH at 25% is about 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. But the equivalence point pH I calculated is about 9.02, but option A says 8.52, which is lower.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should have considered the dilution of the solution at equivalence point.

Wait, at equivalence point, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³.

Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So, the acetate hydrolysis:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let me set up the ICE table.

Initial: [A^-] = 0.02, [HA] = 0, [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: [A^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small), [HA] = x, [OH^-] = x.

So Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

But none of the options have a pH near 9.02 at equivalence point. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution was incorrect? Let me double-check the initial dilution.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, 20 cm³ of water is added. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1 mmol) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So that's correct.

Hmm, but why don't the options have 9.02 as equivalence point pH? Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D: 4.57; 6.92

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Another approach: maybe using the formula for the pH of a salt solution. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate.

But let me think, perhaps the calculation of Kb is correct, but maybe the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is correct.

Wait, what if I don't make that assumption? Let's compute it more accurately.

Set up the equation: x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assume x is about 1e-5, which is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So same as before.

pH is 9.02. But the options don't have this. So maybe I messed up the calculations somewhere else.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the solution at the equivalence point. Alternatively, maybe I should be using the concentration of the sodium acetate solution correctly.

Wait, another way to compute pH at equivalence: using the formula for a weak base.

pOH = ½ (pKb - log C)

Wait, pKb is log(1/(Ka * Kw))? No, wait, pKb is -log K_b.

Wait, pKb = -log(Kw / Ka) = -log( (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ) = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.265.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Kw is 1e-14. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. So pKb = log(5.405e-10)^-1. Let me compute that.

Wait, pKb = -log(Kb) = -log(5.405e-10) ≈ 9.265.

Then, the formula for weak base pH is pOH = ½ (pKb - log C), where C is the concentration.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for a weak base is pH = ½ (pKb - log C ) + pOH? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the pH of a weak base can be found using the formula:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

But this is valid only when Kb << C, which is the case here: Kb is 5.4e-10, C is 0.02 (0.02 is 2e-2). So Kb is much smaller than C, so approximation holds.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.4e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.08e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So pOH ≈ 4.98, pH ≈9.02.

Hmm, same result again.

But none of the options have a pH near 9.02. The closest is option A, which says 8.52 at equivalence.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Kb calculation. Let me recheck.

Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should think about the solution differently. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, another approach: the solution at equivalence is a sodium acetate solution. The pH can also be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pC), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the [H+] directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the equation for the acetate ion's hydrolysis:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assume that x is the concentration of OH^- produced.

So, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

[CH3COOH] = x.

Thus, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

So, x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5, pOH=4.98, so pH=9.02.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial concentration after dilution. Let me check again.

Original volume: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ water, total volume is 40 cm³.

Concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles NaOH = 0.001 mol.

Volume NaOH is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So, at equivalence point, the total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05 = 0.02 M.

So everything seems correct.

But the options don't have 9.02, so perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration pH.

Wait, let me recheck that.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Moles NaOH: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

Moles acetic acid remaining: 0.001 -0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 /0.0425 =0.005882 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

pH = pKa + log(0.3333) = 4.735 + (-0.477) ≈4.258, which is 4.26. So that part seems correct.

Looking at the options, option A has pH 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence.

But my calculation for equivalence is 9.02. So why is option A showing 8.52? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the activity coefficients or something else, but that's way beyond the scope here. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a 25% solution, but not 25% of the equivalence point? No, the question says 25% titration, which I assume is 25% of the way to equivalence.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation for the equivalence point pH.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact formula without approximations.

The equation is x² = Kb * (0.02 -x).

But x is small, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 0.02 *5.405e-10 =1.081e-11.

x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So same as before.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the pKa calculation.

Ka is 1.85e-5.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5).

log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733.

Wait, perhaps the person who made the problem used a different approximation for pKa. Like, maybe someone uses 4.74 as pKa for acetic acid. Well, 4.735 is about 4.74.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH at equivalence point using another approach, like considering the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, but perhaps I made a calculation error.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula pH = ½ (pKa + pC), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another way to calculate pH at equivalence: the solution is a sodium acetate solution. So, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate.

The formula for pH is:

pH = pKa + pOH'

Wait, no, let's think again.

The pH can be calculated using:

pH = ½ (pKa + log (C) )

Wait, no, that's for a buffer solution, but maybe this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the pH using the concentration of OH-.

But I think my initial approach is correct. So the pH at equivalence should be around 9.02, but none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles. Let me recheck.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence point, all 0.001 mol is converted to acetate. So, moles of acetate is 0.001 mol.

Volume is 50 cm³, so 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

So, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5.

pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

Hmm.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is not among them. But that can't be the case. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement. The question says, "dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water".

Wait, that's 20 cm³ of acetic acid plus 20 cm³ of water, making 40 cm³. Correct.

Another thought: perhaps when the problem says "25% titration", they mean 25% of the initial solution's volume. No, no, that's not how titration works. Titration percentage is based on the volume needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should calculate the pH at 25% of the initial volume, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, which is the same as 25% titration.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the 25% point, but perhaps I should consider the dilution.

Wait, no, I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using an approximate method for the equivalence point pH, and I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with a strong base is calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + 1 + log ( [NaOH] / [CH3COOH] )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the assumption that at equivalence point, the solution is a buffer, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using the formula for a salt of a weak acid.

The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pC)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

pH = pKa + log ( (C * sqrt(Ka)) / (1 + C * sqrt(Ka)) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the same approach as for the 25% point, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using an approximation where the pH at equivalence point is calculated as pKa plus something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says pH at equivalence is 6.92, which is acidic. That can't be right because the solution at equivalence is a weak base.

Option A's equivalence pH is 8.52. Let's see: if I calculate using a different Kb.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem used a different Ka value. Oh wait, the given Ka is 1.85e-5.

Wait, perhaps the pH at equivalence is calculated using the formula for a buffer, but that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that at equivalence, the solution is a 0.02 M solution of acetate, and then use a different approach, like the exact solution of the hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation without approximation.

The equation is x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Let me solve it exactly.

Rearranging: x² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 - x).

This is a quadratic equation: x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a

Here a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

Compute D: (5.405e-10)^2 = approx 2.92e-19. 4*1.081e-11=4.324e-11. So D≈ 4.324e-11 + 2.92e-19 ≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Taking positive root: (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10) /2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] ≈3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈5.486.

pH=14-5.486≈8.514, which is approximately 8.51.

Ah! So the pH at equivalence is around 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

Wait, why is this different from the previous approximation? Because when x isn't so small compared to 0.02, the approximation isn't as accurate.

In the initial approach, I assumed x was negligible, but in reality, x is about 3.29e-6, and 0.02 is 2e-2. So x is 3e-6, which is 0.0003% of 0.02, which is indeed negligible. But when I solved the quadratic, I got x ≈3.288e-6, leading to pOH=5.486, pH=8.514.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got x=1.04e-5, which is higher than this. So perhaps the quadratic solution is more accurate, leading to a pH of 8.51.

So that explains why option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but why the difference between the two methods? Because when I first assumed x is negligible, I got x=1.04e-5, but solving the quadratic gives x=3.29e-6. Hmm, that's a significant difference. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.

Wait, wait, let me recompute the quadratic solution.

The equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x - 1.081e-11 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So,

b² = (5.405e-10)^2 = approx 2.92e-19.

4ac =4*1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11.

So, the discriminant is b² +4ac = 2.92e-19 -4.324e-11.

Wait a minute, that would be a negative number, which can't be. That can't be right. Wait, because a=1, c is negative.

Wait no, the equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So 4ac =4 *1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11.

Then, b² = (5.405e-10)^2 = 2.92e-19.

So, discriminant D = b² +4ac = 2.92e-19 + (-4.324e-11) = 2.92e-19 -4.324e-11.

Wait, but 2.92e-19 is 0.000000000000000292, and 4.324e-11 is 0.00000000004324, so 2.92e-19 is way smaller. So D is negative, which can't be right. That would mean no real solution, which can't be correct.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait, the equation from Kb is x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Rearranged: x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Which is x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bringing all terms to left: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Yes, correct.

So discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) ?

Wait, wait, no—4ac is 4*1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11.

So, D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = 2.92e-19 -4.324e-11.

Which is negative. That can't be right. So the initial assumption that x is negligible is wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should have set it as x²/(0.02 -x) = Kb. But perhaps I should consider that the change in [A^-] is +x, but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the ICE table for acetate hydrolysis:

Initial: [A^-] =0.02 M, [HA]=0, [OH^-]=0.

Change: [A^-] decreases by x, [HA] increases by x, [OH^-] increases by x.

So equilibrium concentrations:

[A^-] =0.02 -x,

[HA] =x,

[OH^-]=x.

Thus, Kb= (x)(x)/(0.02 -x) = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Which leads to x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Which is x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

So the discriminant is (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1.081e-11) = 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

Thus,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Taking the positive root, (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.575e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6)=5.486.

pH=14-5.486=8.514≈8.51.

That's why option A's equivalence pH is 8.52. So that must be the correct answer.

So, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and at equivalence is approximately 8.52. So the correct option is A) 4.26;8.52.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the dilution and titration process. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. The moles of acetic acid remain the same, but the concentration decreases to:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, the solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is reached when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. Since the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol, the volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH at equivalence point} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 10.00 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10.00 cm³) is added, which is 2.50 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are 0.00025 mol. The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.50 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.735\), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.735 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.735 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.735 - 0.477 = 4.258 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Using the approximation \(x \ll 0.02\), we solve:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \implies x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation without approximation gives a slightly different result:

\[
x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \quad a = 1, \, b = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}, \, c = -1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}, \quad \text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514 \approx 8.52.
\]
