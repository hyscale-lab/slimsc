Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from acetic acid. Let's outline each step and see what each product looks like.

Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Wait, I remember that when acetic acid reacts with acetic anhydride in the presence of something like PBr3 or another brominating agent, it forms an acyl bromide. Oh wait, but wait, bromine, pyridine... Oh right, that's the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction! That reaction adds a bromine to the alpha position of a carboxylic acid. So acetic acid has two alpha carbons (the CH3 groups adjacent to the COOH). The reaction would add a bromine to one of those CH3 groups.

Wait, wait, wait. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. When it's treated with Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride (which is a catalyst?), the reaction adds a bromine to the methyl group. Because acetic anhydride can activate the alpha position. So the product 1 would be CH2BrCOOH. Wait, no. Wait, the alpha position in acetic acid is the CH3. Adding bromine would substitute one H with Br. So product 1 would be 2-bromoacetic acid? No, wait, wait, the structure of acetic acid is CH3COOH. The alpha carbon is the CH3. So when you brominate, you get CH2BrCOOH. So product 1 is 2-bromoacetic acid? Or wait, perhaps it's the same as bromoacetic acid. So the structure is CH2BrCOOH.

Wait, no, actually, the alpha bromination of acetic acid would lead to CH2BrCOOH. Right. So product 1 is 2-bromoacetic acid.

Wait, but wait, I think I might be mixing up. The Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction adds a bromine to the alpha carbon of a carboxylic acid. So for acetic acid, which has two equivalent alpha hydrogens, the reaction would add one bromine, making CH2BrCOOH. So product 1 is bromoacetic acid, specifically 2-bromoacetic acid.

Moving on. Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. Hmm. Sulfuric acid is a catalyst. Heating with ethanol... Oh, that's probably an esterification reaction. So we're making an ester from the acid. The acid is 2-bromoacetic acid. So the ester would be ethyl 2-bromoacetate. The structure would be BrCH2COOEt. So product 2 is ethyl bromoacetate.

Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide is a nucleophile. So in SN2 reactions, CN- would replace the bromide. Alternatively, since the ester is an ethyl group, perhaps it's a substitution on the alpha carbon. Wait, the structure is BrCH2COOEt. So sodium cyanide (NaCN) would displace Br- in an SN2 mechanism, replacing Br with CN. So the product 3 would be CH2CN-COOEt. So the structure is CH2CNCOOEt, or ethyl 2-cyanoacetate.

Wait, but wait. The ester is ethyl, so when CN- attacks the alpha carbon (which has the Br), it would substitute Br with CN. So yes, product 3 is 2-cyanoethyl acetate? No, wait, the structure would be CH2CNCOOEt, which is ethyl cyanoacetate.

Step 4: Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds. 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide, which suggests an alkylation reaction. So perhaps the cyano group is deprotonated to form a good nucleophile.

Wait, let's think. Sodium hydride would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen adjacent to the cyano group. So the cyano group is an electron-withdrawing group, so the alpha hydrogens are acidic. Deprotonation would give a carbanion. Then, the 1,5-dibromopentane is probably undergoing elimination or alkylation.

Wait, but wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)5Br. When treated with a strong base like NaH, it might eliminate to form an alkyne, but wait, more likely, it's a dihalide for alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a source of a Grignard-like reagent, but I think more likely it's a way to perform a double alkylation.

Let me think again. Product 3 is CH2CNCOOEt. When treated with excess NaH, which is a strong base, it would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen (the CH2 adjacent to the CN). So the structure would become CH2- Câ‰¡N-COOEt, but wait, that's not possible. Wait, the structure is CH2CNCOOEt. So the alpha hydrogen is on the CH2 next to the CN.

So the H on CH2CN is acidic, so deprotonated by NaH, forming a carbanion: [CH2-]CNCOOEt. Then, 1,5-dibromopentane (which is Br(CH2)5Br) would react in an alkylation. Since it's a dihalide, perhaps the carbanion would attack one of the Br atoms, but with excess NaH, maybe both Br's are replaced?

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms on the same carbon? No, wait, no. Wait, no, 1,5-dibromopentane is CH2BrCH2CH2CH2CH2Br. So each end has a Br.

The carbanion (which is a strong base) would attack the 1,5-dibromopentane. But since it's a dihalide, perhaps it's more likely that each Br is replaced by the alkyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a double alkylation. So the carbanion attacks once, giving CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CNCOOEt? No, wait, let me think.

Wait, the carbanion is at the CH2 adjacent to the CN. So the structure after deprotonation is :CH2-CN-COOEt. Then, when reacting with 1,5-dibromopentane, the carbanion would attack one of the CH2Br groups.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide with Br on C1 and C5. So perhaps it's a situation where the carbanion can perform two alkylation steps.

Wait, but wait, if the starting material is :CH2CNCOOEt, then perhaps the carbanion would attack the dihalide once, substituting one Br and giving a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: when a carbanion attacks a dihalide, it can perform a double substitution. So the structure would be:

Initial structure: CH2CNCOOEt.

Deprotonate to form :CH2CNCOOEt.

Then, 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br) reacts. The carbanion attacks one of the Br, replacing it with a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, perhaps each substitution adds a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the carbanion attacks one of the Br in 1,5-dibromopentane. So the product would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CN-COOEt? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try to think again.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is that the carbanion (from CH2CNCOOEt) attacks one of the bromides in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing Br- as a leaving group. So the product after first substitution would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CN-COOEt connected where?

Wait, maybe it's more like this: the starting carbanion is at the CH2 adjacent to CN. So when it attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, which is Br(CH2)5Br, each Br is at the ends. So the carbanion might attack one end, leading to the formation of a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction adds two CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 groups? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1,5-dibromopentane is used as a base or as a dihalide for elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Grignard-like addition, but I don't think so because NaH is a base, not a metal.

Wait, another approach: the treatment with excess NaH would deprotonate the alpha position of the nitrile. So the nitrile is CH2CNCOOEt. Deprotonating gives :CH2CNCOOEt. Then, with 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps the carbanion performs an alkylation, leading to CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CNCOOEt? But wait, that would require two substitutions, but 1,5-dibromopentane has two Brs. So perhaps each Br is replaced by the carbanion, leading to a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the product is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CNCOOEt? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is used to form a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a geminal dihalide, but that doesn't fit here. Alternatively, perhaps the 1,5-dibromopentane is used as a source of a five-carbon chain in a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double alkylation. First, the carbanion attacks one Br, then another Br, leading to a longer chain.

Wait, so the initial structure is CH2CNCOOEt. When treated with NaH, it becomes :CH2CNCOOEt. Then, reacting with 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps the carbanion attacks one Br, giving CH2-(CH2)5-CN-COOEt? But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-(CH2)5-Br, so attacking one Br would give CH2-(CH2)5-CN-COOEt. But then, since NaH is in excess, perhaps another deprotonation and substitution occurs, adding another (CH2)5 group. But that would make a 10-carbon chain, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1,5-dibromopentane is used in a way that each Br adds a CH2 group. Wait, perhaps each substitution adds a -(CH2)5- group. So after two substitutions, the CH2 would become CH2-(CH2)5-CH2-(CH2)5-CN-COOEt. But the product would be a very long chain. But maybe the actual reaction is that each substitution adds a -(CH2)4- group. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1,5-dibromopentane is treated with a strong base like NaH, and it undergoes elimination to form an alkyne. Wait, no, 1,5-dibromopentane eliminating would form a triple bond? Wait, no, elimination of HBr from 1,5-dibromopentane would form a diene? Or perhaps a triple bond if two HBr molecules are eliminated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, but 1,5-dibromopentane is not a vicinal dihalide (it's 1 and 5 positions). So elimination would require adjacent Brs, which it doesn't have. So perhaps elimination isn't the pathway here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently: when the nitrile is treated with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps the nitrile is converted into an alkyne via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product 3 is ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (CH2CNCOOEt). Then, when treated with excess NaH, which is a strong base, perhaps it deprotonates the alpha hydrogens (the ones adjacent to the cyano group), forming an enolate-like structure. Then, 1,5-dibromopentane could act as an alkylating agent, providing a five-carbon chain. So each substitution would add a five-carbon group.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane has two Brs on the ends. So perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon group. So the initial structure is CH2CNCOOEt. After substituting once, it becomes CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt. Then, substituting again (since NaH is in excess), it becomes CH2(CH2)5CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt? Wait, that would make a very long chain, 10 carbons, but perhaps it's adding two five-carbon groups. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is adding a five-carbon group once. Let's think: after substitution, the structure would be CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt. But wait, that would make a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution is happening in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the 1,5-dibromopentane is used to form a Grignard-like reagent, but that would require Mg, not NaH. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is forming a tri-substituted or di-substituted product. Let me think again about product 3. It's CH2CNCOOEt. When treated with NaH, which is a strong base, the H adjacent to the CN is deprotonated, forming a carbanion. Then, this carbanion attacks the 1,5-dibromopentane, which is Br-(CH2)5-Br. The carbanion would substitute one of the Br atoms. So after the first substitution, the structure would be CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt. But wait, that's a single substitution. However, since NaH is in excess, perhaps another substitution occurs, substituting the other Br, giving CH2(CH2)5CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt. But that would require two substitutions. Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon group, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1,5-dibromopentane is used to add a five-carbon chain to the alpha position of the nitrile. So the product would be CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt. Then, since the NaH is in excess, perhaps another substitution occurs, adding another five-carbon group. So the final structure would be CH2(CH2)5CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt. But that's a bit hard to imagine.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of product 4. Let me try to figure out the structure, then I can determine the NMR signals.

Product 3 is CH2CNCOOEt. Then, after treatment with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CN-COOEt, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, perhaps the substitution adds a five-carbon chain to the CH2 group adjacent to the CN.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the initial CH2CNCOOEt becomes CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH2CNCOOEt after substitution. So the structure is CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-(CH2)5-Br. So substituting once would give CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH2-CN-COOEt. Wait, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double substitution, adding two five-carbon chains. So the product would be CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-CN-COOEt. But that seems too long, and perhaps the question expects a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not substitution but something else. Wait, another thought: perhaps the 1,5-dibromopentane is used to form an epoxide or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitrile group is involved. But nitriles are not typically leaving groups. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is converted into an amine or something else, but I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the fourth step. Let me think again.

Product 3 is ethyl 2-cyanoacetate: structure is CH2CNCOOEt.

Step 4: treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane. NaH is a strong base, so it deprotonates the alpha hydrogen (the CH2 next to CN). So the carbanion formed is :CH2-CN-COOEt.

The 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)5Br. So when :CH2- attacks one of the Br atoms, it would substitute Br with a (CH2)5 group. So the product would be CH2(CH2)5-CN-COOEt.

Wait, but wait, since NaH is in excess, perhaps two substitutions occur. So the product would have two (CH2)5 groups added. So the structure would be CH2(CH2)5CH2(CH2)5-CN-COOEt. But that's a 10-carbon chain.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the actual reaction mechanism. The initial substitution would add a (CH2)5 group. Then, perhaps the other Br in 1,5-dibromopentane is attacked again, adding another (CH2)5 group. But that would require the same carbanion to attack twice, which might not be feasible because after the first substitution, the structure would have a longer chain, perhaps making the carbanion less likely to form again. Alternatively, perhaps each substitution occurs at a different site.

Wait, perhaps the product 4 is CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt. So the structure is CH2-(CH2)5-Câ‰¡N-COOEt. Now, I need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR of this structure.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely confident about the structure. Let me try to imagine the structure.

If the product is CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt, then the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

Wait, but that's a straight chain. Let me count the hydrogens.

But wait, let's make sure of the structure. The nitrile is at the end, attached to a five-carbon chain.

Wait, actually, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

Wait, no, because the substitution is once. So the product is CH2-(CH2)5-CN-COOEt.

So the structure would be:

COOEt is the ester group. Then, a CN group attached to a CH2, which is attached to a chain of five CH2 groups. Wait, no, wait, the substitution adds a five-carbon chain, so the structure is:

COOEt-O-C-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. The nitrile is on the CH2 which is connected to the ester. Then, the substitution adds a five-carbon chain to that CH2.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2-(CH2)5-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

So the nitrile is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a five-carbon chain, which in turn is attached to the ester.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds a five-carbon chain to the CH2 adjacent to the nitrile. So the structure is CH2-(CH2)5-Câ‰¡N-COOEt. So in this molecule, the CH2 next to the nitrile is attached to a five-carbon chain. Let me draw this out.

The structure would be: O

     |
O-CO-OEt

     |
Câ‰¡N-CH2-(CH2)5-CH2-...

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The ester is OEt-O-CO-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's seven carbons in a row. Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt. So the nitrile is on a CH2 group, which is attached to a five-carbon chain. So the structure is:

COOEt-O-CO-OEt? No, wait, the ester is OEt-O-CO-CH2-Câ‰¡N-(CH2)5-CH3.

Wait, no, the (CH2)5 would be between the nitrile and the CH3. So the structure is CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CH2-COOEt.

Wait, but that's seven carbons in the chain from the nitrile to the ester. So the nitrile is on the seventh carbon from the ester.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of distinct hydrogens. Let's imagine the structure as:

COOEt-O-CO-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt, but with a five-carbon chain added to the CH2. So the structure would be CH2-(CH2)5-Câ‰¡N-COOEt. Wait, but that would make the nitrile attached to a five-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOEt-O-CO-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me consider that after substitution, the molecule is CH2-(CH2)5-CN-COOEt. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CO-OEt.

Wait, but that's seven carbons in a row. So the chain is six carbons long (including the CH2 attached to the nitrile). Hmm.

But perhaps the structure is such that the nitrile is at one end, and the ester is at the other. So, the chain is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CO-OEt.

Wait, but that would make the nitrile on a CH2 that's connected to five more CH2 groups, then the COOEt.

In this structure, each CH2 in the chain would have different environments, leading to different NMR signals.

Wait, but let's think about the actual structure. The product after the fourth step is a compound with a nitrile group, an ester group, and a chain of five CH2 groups between them.

So the structure is:

COOEt-O-CO-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps that's not right. Let me try to count the carbons:

Original product 3: CH2CNCOOEt.

After substitution with 1,5-dibromopentane, which has five CH2 groups between the two Br atoms. So each substitution adds a (CH2)5 group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each Br in 1,5-dibromopentane is replaced by the carbanion, leading to the addition of two (CH2)5 groups. So the structure would be:

CH2-(CH2)5-CH2-(CH2)5-CN-COOEt.

Wait, that would make the chain longer, but perhaps that's the case.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to figure out the structure after step 4.

Product 3 is CH2CNCOOEt. Step 4: treatment with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane.

NaH deprotonates the alpha H (H on CH2 next to CN) to form a carbanion. Then, this attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, which is Br-(CH2)5-Br. So the carbanion would substitute one Br, adding a (CH2)5 group. So the product would be CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt.

Wait, but then the structure is:

CH2-(CH2)5-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

So the chain is five carbons long between the CH2 and the nitrile, then the ester.

Wait, no, the substitution would add a (CH2)5 group to the CH2, making the structure:

CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CO-OEt.

Now, let's imagine the NMR of this structure.

In the NMR, each set of equivalent hydrogens gives a signal. Let's look for symmetry.

The molecule is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CO-OEt.

Wait, no, wait, the chain is CH2-(CH2)5-Câ‰¡N-COOEt. Wait, perhaps the chain is longer. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds a (CH2)5 group to the CH2, making the structure CH2-(CH2)5-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Let me try to imagine the molecule as having a nitrile group attached via a chain to an ester group.

Assuming the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

So the molecule is:

- Ester group (COOEt) at one end.

- Nitrile group (Câ‰¡N) at the other end.

- In between, five methylene (CH2) groups.

Wait, but wait, that would make the chain six CH2 groups in a row. Because CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt. No, wait, that's six CH2 groups between the nitrile and the ester?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me recount.

Product 3 is CH2CNCOOEt. The structure is:

CH2-Câ‰¡N-CO-OEt.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is CH2CNCOOEt, which is CH2CN-COOEt. So the ester is attached to the nitrile.

After substitution, perhaps the structure becomes CH2-(CH2)5-CN-COOEt.

So the entire molecule is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

Wait, but that's six carbons in a row: the CH2 from the substitution, then five more CH2 groups, then the nitrile, then the ester.

Wait, wait, no. The substitution adds a (CH2)5 group to the CH2 adjacent to the nitrile. So the structure is:

CH2-(CH2)5-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

In this case, the chain is six carbons long (the CH2, then five more CH2 groups), making the molecule:

COOEt-O-CO-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: the substitution adds a (CH2)5 group to the CH2, making the chain of six CH2 groups in a row.

So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

So the molecule is a straight chain with six methylene groups between the nitrile and the ester.

Now, in terms of NMR signals, each set of equivalent hydrogens will give a distinct signal. Let's count the different environments.

1. The CH2 next to the ester (CH2-COOEt): this is the first CH2. It's adjacent to the ester group, so it's deshielded and will have a distinct signal.

2. The next CH2 in the chain: this is the CH2 after the first one. It's in a different environment than the first and will have another signal.

3. The middle CH2 groups: in a six-carbon chain, the middle CH2 groups (positions 3 and 4) are equivalent because the molecule is symmetric around the center. So each of these will give a single signal.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the symmetry. If the chain is six CH2 groups long, the molecule is symmetric when it's even? No, wait, six is even, so the middle would be between the third and fourth CH2 groups. So the third and fourth CH2 groups would be equivalent. So the third and fourth would give one signal.

Wait, but wait, let me think: the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

Wait, no, that's seven groups in a row. Wait, no, the chain is six CH2 groups between the nitrile and the ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOEt-O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N.

So the chain is six CH2 groups in a row.

In that case, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, except for the first and last.

So let's number the CH2 groups:

1: attached to COOEt.

2: next to 1.

3: next to 2.

4: next to 3.

5: next to 4.

6: attached to Câ‰¡N.

So, each CH2 group is in a different environment.

Wait, but in an even-length chain, the first and last CH2 groups are equivalent? No, because one is attached to COOEt and the other to Câ‰¡N. So they are not equivalent.

But wait, if the chain is symmetric, perhaps the second and fifth CH2 groups are equivalent, and the third and fourth are equivalent. Let me think.

In a six-membered chain, the first CH2 is next to the ester, the second is next to the first, and so on until the sixth, which is next to the nitrile.

If the chain is symmetric, then the first and sixth CH2 groups would be mirror images, but since they're attached to different functional groups (ester and nitrile), they are not equivalent. Similarly, the second and fifth CH2 groups would be in symmetric positions but attached to different parts (ester side and nitrile side), so they might not be equivalent.

Wait, perhaps each CH2 group is unique. Let's imagine:

Each CH2 in the chain has a different environment. So:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

So each of the six CH2 groups is unique, leading to six signals from the chain.

Then, the ester group (COOEt) has two sets of hydrogens: the OCH2CH3 group. The CH3 in the ethyl group is attached to a CH2, which is attached to O. The CH2CH3 group has two sets: the CH2 (attached to O) and the CH3.

Wait, but in the ethyl ester, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. The CH2 is split into two signals: the CH2 next to O and the CH3 at the end. Wait, but in the ethyl group, the CH2 is adjacent to the oxygen and has two H's, and the CH3 is at the end with three H's. But are these signals split?

Wait, in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 group usually has two signals: the OCH2 (as a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH3) and the CH3 (as a triplet). But in the case where the molecule is symmetric or has certain substituents, these might be split differently.

But in our case, the ethyl group is attached to an ester, which is part of a larger molecule. So the OCH2CH3 group would have the usual two signals: OCH2 as a quartet and CH3 as a triplet. However, in our case, the ester is attached to a long chain, so perhaps the coupling constants are different, but it still gives two signals.

Wait, no, in the NMR, the ethyl group's protons are usually split into a quartet (CH2) and a triplet (CH3), but this depends on the neighboring groups.

Additionally, the nitrile group (Câ‰¡N) doesn't have any hydrogens, so it doesn't contribute to the NMR.

So, putting it all together:

- The six CH2 groups in the chain each give a distinct signal. So 6 signals.

- The ethyl ester's OCH2CH3 gives two signals: one for the CH2 (quartet) and one for the CH3 (triplet). So 2 signals.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the ethyl group is deshielded in this molecule, but in any case, it's two signals.

So total signals would be 6 (from the chain) + 2 (from ester) = 8 signals.

Wait, but wait, let me recount. The chain has six CH2 groups, each giving a unique signal. The ethyl ester has two signals. So 6 + 2 = 8.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about any other hydrogens.

The nitrile group doesn't have any H. The ester is OCH2CH3.

So total is 6 (chain) + 2 (ester) = 8.

But looking at the options, option A is 8.

But wait, I might have made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds two (CH2)5 groups, making the chain longer. For example, two substitutions would add two (CH2)5 groups, making a chain of 10 CH2 groups. But that would complicate the NMR signals even more, but perhaps the product 4 has a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the product is CH2-(CH2)10-CN-COOEt. So the chain is 10 CH2 groups. In that case, the symmetry might make some of the CH2 groups equivalent.

But in that case, the chain would have 10 CH2 groups. The middle four CH2 groups would be equivalent, giving a single signal. The first and last would each give signals, and the second and ninth would be equivalent, etc. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, but I'm not confident about the structure. Let me think about the initial steps again.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the final product 4 is a diethyl ester, or perhaps it's a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds a five-carbon chain once, making the chain five CH2 groups long. Then, the NMR would have five signals from the chain.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me consider that the final structure has a chain of five CH2 groups between the nitrile and the ester.

So the chain is five CH2 groups. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

In this case, there are five CH2 groups in the chain. Each is in a unique environment, so 5 signals. Plus the two from the ethyl ester, totaling 7. But this isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the chain is longer. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a branched chain, but I don't think so.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is only three CH2 groups. Then the signals would be 3 (chain) + 2 (ester) = 5, which is option B. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of distinct signals in the product.

Another approach: considering that product 4 is a substituted ethyl cyanoacetate with a longer chain.

If the chain is five CH2 groups, the NMR would have five signals for the chain, plus two from the ester, totaling seven. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution leads to a single CH2 group added. So the structure is CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N-COOEt. Then, the chain has two CH2 groups, leading to two signals, plus two from the ester: total four, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds two CH2 groups, making the chain three CH2 groups long. Then, three signals from the chain, plus two from the ester: five signals. That's option B (5). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product 4 more carefully. Let me try to retrace the steps.

Step 1: acetic acid becomes 2-bromoacetic acid.

Step 2: esterification with ethanol gives ethyl 2-bromoacetate.

Step 3: substitution with NaCN gives ethyl 2-cyanoacetate.

Step 4: treatment with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane.

Wait, perhaps during step 4, the NaH deprotonates the alpha H (the CH2 next to the nitrile), forming a carbanion. This carbanion then reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane, which is a dihalide. The dihalide can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne, but that's probably not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by the carbanion, leading to the addition of two five-carbon chains.

Wait, perhaps the product 4 is a geminal di-substitution, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a Grignard-like reagent. Wait, but NaH is a base, not a metal. So perhaps it's a double alkylation.

So, the initial substitution adds a five-carbon chain, and another substitution adds another five-carbon chain. So the structure would have two five-carbon chains attached to the same carbon.

Wait, if that's the case, the structure would be:

(CH2)5-Câ‰¡N-CO-OEt and another (CH2)5 group attached to the same carbon. So the structure would be (CH2)5-C-Câ‰¡N-CO-OEt, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon chain to the same carbon, leading to a branching. So the structure would be:

CH2-C(CH2)5-CH2-Câ‰¡N-CO-OEt.

But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution adds a five-carbon chain to the CH2 adjacent to the nitrile, making the structure CH2-(CH2)5-Câ‰¡N-COOEt.

So, the chain is six carbons long (CH2, then five CH2 groups, then nitrile, then ester).

In terms of NMR signals, the six CH2 groups in the chain would each have distinct environments, leading to six signals. The ethyl ester would contribute two more, making a total of eight.

So the answer would be eight, which is option A.


To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4, we analyze the structure of product 4 based on the given reaction sequence:

1. **Step 1**: Acetic acid reacts with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride to form 2-bromoacetic acid (CH2BrCOOH). This is a result of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, which brominates the alpha position of the carboxylic acid.

2. **Step 2**: 2-Bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol and sulfuric acid to form ethyl 2-bromoacetate (CH2BrCOOEt). This is an esterification reaction.

3. **Step 3**: Ethyl 2-bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to form ethyl 2-cyanoacetate (CH2CNCOOEt). This is an SN2 substitution where the bromine is replaced by a cyano group.

4. **Step 4**: Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. Sodium hydride deprotonates the alpha hydrogen (the CH2 group adjacent to the cyano group), forming a carbanion. This carbanion reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane, a dihalide, in a double alkylation reaction. Each bromine atom is replaced by the carbanion, resulting in the addition of two five-carbon chains to the CH2 group. The final product is CH2(CH2)5CH2(CH2)5CNCOOEt.

### Structure of Product 4
The structure of product 4 is a straight-chain molecule with the following features:
- An ethyl ester group (COOEt) at one end.
- A nitrile group (Câ‰¡N) at the other end.
- A chain of 10 methylene (CH2) groups between the nitrile and the ester.

### Analysis of 1H NMR Signals
In the 1H NMR spectrum, each set of chemically distinct hydrogens produces a unique signal. For product 4:
1. **The ethyl ester group (COOEt)** contributes two signals:
   - The CH2 group adjacent to the oxygen (OCH2) appears as a quartet.
   - The CH3 group at the end of the ethyl group (CH3) appears as a triplet.

2. **The chain of 10 CH2 groups** contributes six signals:
   - The CH2 group adjacent to the ester (CH2-COOEt) is deshielded and appears as a distinct signal.
   - The CH2 groups in positions 2â€“9 are in different chemical environments due to their varying distances from the ester and nitrile groups, resulting in five additional distinct signals.
   - The CH2 group adjacent to the nitrile (CH2-Câ‰¡N) is also deshielded and appears as a distinct signal.

### Total Number of Signals
Adding the contributions from the ethyl ester and the chain, the total number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4 is **8**.
