Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I should parse this correctly. Oh right, the interaction term is probably something like λ f X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning that the boson X is coupling to fermions with a coupling constant λ and a Yukawa coupling type interaction.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, the question is about which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, based on their masses.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the fermion's mass must be less than half the mass of the boson. Because when the boson decays, the total energy available is the mass of X, and each fermion would get some energy. But since they are a pair, each needs to have mass less than X/2.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Half of that is 3 GeV. So any fermion with a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

What are the known fermion masses? Let me think.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). Their masses are approximately:

u: ~1 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
d: ~3-5 MeV
s: ~95-105 MeV
c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
b: ~4.1-4.7 GeV
t: ~173 GeV (way above 3 GeV)
So for quarks, only u, d, s, and c are below 3 GeV. Wait, c is about 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3. So X can decay into c cbar, s sbar, and u ubar, d dbar.

Then there are leptons: electron (e), muon (mu), tau (tau), and neutrinos. Their masses:

e: ~0.5 MeV
mu: ~105.7 MeV
tau: ~1.777 GeV
Neutrinos are almost massless, so negligible.

So tau is ~1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

The muon is 105.7 MeV, so that's way below 3 GeV, so X can decay into mu+ mu-.

The electron is even lighter, so that's allowed too.

What about the charged leptons and their partners? So the possible decay channels would need to consist of particles that each have mass less than 3 GeV. So for each decay, the sum of the fermion and antifermion masses must be less than the mass of X, but wait, actually, the threshold is that each individual mass is less than X/2. Because when you produce a pair, the rest mass needed is 2m_fermion, so 2m must be less than m_X. So m_fermion < m_X / 2 = 3 GeV.

Wait, no: the mass of the fermion is m, so each fermion is m, so the pair is 2m. The available energy is m_X. So for the process X → f fbar, the condition is 2m_f < m_X. So m_f < m_X / 2.

So for X = 6 GeV, m_X/2 is 3 GeV.

So any fermion with m_f < 3 GeV can be produced.

So let's list fermions:

Quarks:

u: ~1 MeV → yes
d: ~3 MeV → yes
s: ~100 MeV → yes
c: ~1.5 GeV → yes (since 1.5 <3)
b: ~4.5 GeV → no (4.5>3)
t: way too heavy → no

Leptons:

e: negligible → yes
mu: ~0.1 GeV → yes
tau: ~1.777 GeV → yes

So decay products can include:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Wait, what about the top quark? No, top is too heavy. The bottom quark is also heavier than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b or t.

So the possible decay channels are into these fermions.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b's mass is ~4.7 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b and bbar. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That seems correct. Because c is allowed, all the quarks u, d, s, c are under 3 GeV.

Option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

But wait, let me check the options again. Let me see what the options are.

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes, all allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair (\( f \bar{f} \)), the fermion mass \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f < m_X \), or equivalently \( m_f < m_X / 2 \). Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the threshold is \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Mass Analysis:
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u \): \( \sim 1 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) → allowed.
   - \( d \): \( \sim 3-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) → allowed.
   - \( s \): \( \sim 95-105 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) → allowed.
   - \( c \): \( \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( < 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) → allowed.
   - \( b \): \( \sim 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) → not allowed.
   - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) → not allowed.

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e \): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) → allowed.
   - \( \mu \): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \ll 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) → allowed.
   - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( < 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) → allowed.

### Allowed Decay Channels:
The boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
- \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \).

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.
