Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the comoving distance of a quasar based on some observations. Hmm, let's read the question again carefully.

The question says that observations of a quasar are made in near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and flux drops below that. Wait, I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and sometimes have specific features. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But if the quasar's light is redshifted, that line would appear at longer wavelengths. So maybe the peak at 790 nm is the redshifted Lyman-alpha line?

Wait, wait. Lyman-alpha is at 121.6 nm when emitted. So if it's observed at 790 nm, what's the redshift z? The formula is observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). So 790 = 121.6 * (1 + z). Let's compute that.

790 / 121.6 ≈ let's see, 121.6 * 6 is 729.6, which is less than 790. 729.6 is 6 times, so 790-729.6=60.4. 60.4/121.6 ≈ 0.497. So 1 + z ≈ 6.497, so z ≈5.497. So redshift z is about 5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1. Comoving distance is a measure of the distance to an object, considering the expansion of the universe. But wait, the comoving distance is D_c = c * t * (1 + z) / a, but a=1, so D_c= c * t * (1 + z), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think the formula for comoving distance is the integral from 0 to z of c/(a^2 H(a)) da, but that might not be the way to go.

Wait, another approach: The comoving distance is the distance that would be measured by a ruler moving with the Hubble flow. The formula is D_c = (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda).

Given the parameters: Hubble constant H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. But I need to compute the integral for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_lambda=0.7.

I remember that for a flat universe, the integral for comoving distance can be approximated using specific values or even look-up tables for certain redshifts. Wait, I think that at z
