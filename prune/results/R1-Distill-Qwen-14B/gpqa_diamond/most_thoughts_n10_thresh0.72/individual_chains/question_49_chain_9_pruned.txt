Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond within a sigma framework. They're a type of pericyclic reaction, right? So, the question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different starting materials and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each.

Let me start by looking at each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) -> A.

Wait, I'm trying to recall what kind of reaction this is. The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine and but-3-en-2-ol. When these are heated with H+, maybe it's a Claisen or Cope rearrangement? Or perhaps an acid-catalyzed cyclization?

Wait, another thought: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on the ethylamine. If I combine this with but-3-en-2-ol, which is an allyl alcohol, perhaps it's an example of a Claisen-like rearrangement, where an allyl group is involved.

Wait, another approach. The structure of 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is CH2(OCH3)2NH. When it reacts with an allyl alcohol, maybe it forms an enamine. Oh, because enamine formation involves an amine reacting with a ketone or aldehyde, but here we have an allyl alcohol. Oh wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH. If that's the case, perhaps the amine is acting as a base, but under acidic conditions, maybe it's protonated.

Wait, but the presence of H+ and heat suggests that it's a condensation reaction. Maybe the amine and the alcohol are reacting. Wait, but 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine has two OMe groups attached to the same carbon as the amine. So, the molecule is (CH2OCH3)2NH. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of a Cope rearrangement. Wait, but the Cope rearrangement is for
