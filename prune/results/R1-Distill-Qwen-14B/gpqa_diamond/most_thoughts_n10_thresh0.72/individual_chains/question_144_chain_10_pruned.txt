Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that decay length has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right! The formula for the mean decay distance (L) is L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity over c, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh, right, the uncertainty principle relates the width Γ to the lifetime. The relation is τ ≈ ℏ / Γ. But I think Γ is given in MeV, and I need to be careful with the units. Also, I remember that Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ/(Γ), but I might have to use the reduced Planck constant or something.

Wait, alternatively, I think Γ is the total decay width, and the mean proper lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to make sure the units are consistent.

Let me jot down the variables:

E_X = 8 GeV (production energy)
m_X = 1.2 GeV (mass)
Γ_X = 320 MeV (width)

I need to find the decay length. So, steps:

1. Calculate the velocity β of the meson X.
2. Find the Lorentz factor γ.
3. Calculate the proper lifetime τ.
4. Plug into L = γ * β * c * τ.

Wait, but how do I get the velocity and gamma from the given energy and mass? The meson is produced with energy E_X, so E = γ m c². So γ = E_X / (m_X c²). Wait, but c is a big number, so when dealing with units in GeV and MeV, perhaps we can use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1? But I think in this problem, I need to calculate using SI units.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma as E / (m c²). But let's see: E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E = γ m c²
