Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar's spectrum and figuring out its comoving distance using the Lambda-CDM model parameters. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly at wavelengths shorter than that. Wait, what does that tell me? Oh right, that peak is probably the Lyman-alpha emission line, but wait, the Lyman-alpha is usually around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But if we're seeing it shifted to 790 nm, that must mean the quasar is redshifted.

So to find the redshift, I can use the formula for wavelength shift. The observed wavelength λ_obs is 790 nm, and the rest wavelength λ_rest for Lyman-alpha is about 121 nm. Redshift z is (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. Let me calculate that: 790 / 121 is approximately 6.528, so z is about 5.528. So z ≈ 5.53.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1, which is the current universe. The comoving distance D_C is what we need to find, given the Hubble constant H0, matter density Ω_m, dark energy Ω_Λ, and knowing the universe is flat (so Ω_total = 1).

Wait, the parameters given are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, which fits the flat universe because 0.3 + 0.7 = 1. So that's good.

The comoving distance depends on the integral from 0 to z of 1/(H(a)) da, where H(a) is the Hubble parameter as a function of scale factor a. H(a) = H0 * sqrt(Ω_m*(1+a)^3 + Ω_Λ). Wait, because in a flat universe, the sum is 1
