Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think through it step by step.

First, the problem says there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the second has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. When they're talking about relative speed in relativity, it's not just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. So I can't just do 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. That's probably a common mistake. So I should use the formula for relative velocity in special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²), but I think I have to be careful about the direction. Oh wait, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed is the difference in their speeds divided by 1 minus the product of their speeds over c squared. Let me write that down.

So astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, astronaut B at v = 0.5c. The relative speed from A's frame would be (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Plugging the numbers in, that's (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Simplify numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. That would be the relative speed between them. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, so E = gamma * m c². For each, I need to calculate their gamma factor.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate each:

For the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c):
gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So their energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m, 0.5c):
gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² → 3.464 m c².

Wait, wait, let me calculate that accurately. 3 * 1.1547 is approximately 3.464. So E1 is 2.5 m c² and E2 is about 3.464 m c². So the total energy is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc². Hmm, 5.96 is closer to 6, but the
