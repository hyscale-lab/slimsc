Okay, I have this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my accelerator physics, but let's try to think through this.

So the question is about a proton injected into a synchrocyclotron with negligible kinetic energy. It goes through two accelerations and reaches a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The phase constant is Φ0 = π/4, and the voltage U0 is 190 kV. We need to find how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, what's a synchrocyclotron? I remember that cyclotrons are devices used to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons might be a type that can handle relativistic particles better, right? Because regular cyclotrons have a fixed magnetic field, but when particles reach relativistic speeds, their mass increases, making the cyclotron frequency change. So synchrocyclotrons adjust the frequency to keep up, allowing for higher energies.

But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Let me think. The key here is probably to relate the kinetic energy gained by the proton to the number of times it's accelerated by the voltage.

The proton starts with negligible KE, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Or is that a typo? Or perhaps it's two steps in the acceleration process? Hmm, maybe the problem means that the proton is accelerated twice per revolution or something like that. Or maybe it's saying the voltage is applied with two cycles? Not sure yet.

The voltage is alternating, so each time the voltage completes a cycle, the proton might gain a certain amount of energy. Since the voltage is sinusoidal, the maximum voltage is U0, which is 190 kV. Each time the proton goes through a half-cycle (like a half-period), it can gain energy equal to the voltage peak. Because in a cyclotron, the electric field alternates to push the particle each time it comes around. So each full cycle (one period) the particle gains 2U0 energy? Or maybe just U0 per half-cycle?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The electric field alternates, so each time the proton completes a half-circle, the voltage changes sign. So maybe per half-cycle, the proton gets a kick of energy equal to U0. Because when the voltage is at maximum positive, the proton is accelerated, and when it goes negative, the acceleration direction changes. Or wait, no, because the voltage is applied in such a way that it's synchronized with the particle's motion.

Wait, let's get back to the basics. The cyclotron equation. The frequency in a synchrocyclotron is adjusted, but for non-relativistic cases, the cyclotron frequency is ω = (eB)/(m), but when relativistic effects are considered, the mass increases, so the frequency decreases. But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is varied to match the particle's changing mass as it gains energy.

But this problem is about the number of revolutions. Each revolution, the proton gains some energy from the voltage. Since the voltage is U0 cos(...), the maximum energy given per half-cycle is U0. But wait, the voltage is sinusoidal, so each time the cosine function completes a full cycle, the proton goes through one acceleration cycle.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the acceleration occurs every time the particle passes through the gap between the dees. The voltage alternates to push the particle each time it comes around. So for each passage, the particle gains an energy of U0 (the peak voltage). So each revolution, the proton gains U0 of energy.

Wait, but the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that. Oh wait, perhaps it undergoes acceleration twice per revolution? Or maybe the voltage is applied twice per revolution, so the proton
