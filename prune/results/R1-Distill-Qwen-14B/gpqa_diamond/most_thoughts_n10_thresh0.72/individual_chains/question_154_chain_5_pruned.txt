Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. The chemist has given the mass, IR, and 1H NMR data. I need to figure out which option among A, B, C, D is correct.

Let me jot down the data first:

Mass Spec:
- Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)
- Another peak at m/z = 158 (32%)

IR:
- Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1
- Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1

1H NMR:
- 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)
- 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)

The options are:
A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

Hmm, okay. Let me start by analyzing each piece of data one by one.

First, the Mass Spec. The molecular ion is at 156. Then there's a peak at 158, which is 2 units higher. Wait, that could be a chlorine isotope because Cl has a common isotope at mass 35 (about 75%) and 37 (25%). So if the molecular formula includes a Cl, the molecular ion would have two peaks: M and M+2. So, let's think about the molecular weight.

The molecular ion is at 156, so the molecular formula's molecular weight is around 156 g/mol, and considering Cl, which is about 35.5. Let me think about the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Chlorine adds 35.5, so the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Wait, let me calculate the molecular weight. Carbon is 12, hydrogen 1, Cl 35.5, oxygen 16.

C:7*12=84, H:5*1=5, Cl:35.5, O:2*16=32. So total is 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Oh, but the molecular ion is 156. Hmm, that's a problem. But wait, 156.5 would be around 156 or 157, but the molecular ion is at 156. So perhaps the molecule is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, but the exact mass might be 156.49 (approx). So the molecular ion is at 156. But there's another peak at m/z 158, which would be the Cl-37 isotope. So the M and M+2 peaks make sense.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. It's the same as B but the position is different. The molecular weight would be same, so same reasoning applies.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The formula is C6H5COCl. Let's calculate: C7H5OCl. Wait, C:7*12=84, H:5*1=5, O:16, Cl:35.5. So 84+5=89, +16=105, +35.5=140.5. Hmm, wait that's only 140.5, but the molecular ion here is 156. So that can't be. So option C is out because the molecular weight is lower.

Option A:3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula is C7H5O2Cl. Let me calculate: C:7*12=84, H:5=5, O:32 (2*16), Cl:35.5. So 84+5=89 +32=121 +35.5=156.5. So the molecular ion would be at 156.5, which would round to 157, but the given molecular ion is 156. Hmm, so perhaps this is a problem. Alternatively, I'm probably miscalculating.

Wait, let me check the formula for each option.

Option A:
3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is C7H6O2Cl. Wait, wait: Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. So adding Cl and OH groups. Let me count the atoms.

Benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO, which is C7H6O. If it has a Cl at position 3 and an OH at position 2, then the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Because the benzaldehyde has 6 C in the ring, then the aldehyde is one more C. So 7 C. The OH and Cl replace H's. So H count: benzene rings normally have 5 H in substituted positions. Benzaldehyde has 5 H, perhaps? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of degrees of unsaturation or just exact molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the exact molecular weight.

Option A: C7H6ClO2.

Wait, wait. Let's compute each option's molecular weight.

Option A: molecular formula. Let's see: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

So structure is: benzaldehyde (PhCHO) with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2.

So the formula is C7H5ClO2? Because:

PhCHO is C7H6O. Replacing one H with Cl (so H goes from 6 to 5) and another H with OH (so another H is replaced, so H becomes 4? Wait, maybe I'm not counting right.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of each substituent:

PhCHO: C7H6O.

Adding Cl and OH groups would change H count.

Wait, wait I might be getting confused. Let me think about the molecular formula for each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to benzene ring in position 4, and COOH group in position 1. So, formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: C=7*12=84, H=5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=2*16=32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So molecular ion would be at 156, but with Cl, the M and M+2 would be at 156 and 158. The mass spec shows a peak at 156 (100%) and 158 (32%), which is consistent with Cl (since Cl-35 is 75%, but the Cl-37 is 25% abundance, so the M+2 would be about 25% as much as M (but wait, depends on the number of Cl atoms). Let me think: Each Cl contributes to M and M+2. Since there's one Cl, the M is at 156 (Cl-35) and M+2 is 158 (Cl-37). So the ratio would be approximately 75% (for Cl-35) and 25% (Cl-37). But in the data, M is 100%, M+2 is 32%. Hmm, that doesn't fit exactly. Because typically, with one Cl, the M+2 would be around 25-30% of M. So 32% is close enough. So this could fit.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same molecular weight as B, so M is 156.5, same as B. So same reasoning applies.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula is C7H6O2Cl. Wait, wait. Let's recount. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O, adding Cl and OH. So maybe the formula is C7H5ClO2? Because adding Cl and OH would each take a hydrogen
