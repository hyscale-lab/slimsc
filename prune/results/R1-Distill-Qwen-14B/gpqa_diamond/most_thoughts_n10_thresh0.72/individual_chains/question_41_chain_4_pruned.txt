Okay, so I have this physics problem about light moving through a glass, and the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that when objects are moving, especially in relativity, things get a bit tricky. But wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Let me think about this.

So, the setup: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer in the lab.

Wait, wait. The speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But does the movement of the medium (the glass) affect this speed? Oh right, in classical mechanics, Galilean relativity, velocities add up. But wait, I think that's only an approximation and doesn't hold at high speeds. But since the problem doesn't mention anything about relativistic speeds, maybe we can treat it with classical velocity addition.

Wait, but wait again. The speed of light is always c in a vacuum, according to Einstein's postulate of special relativity. But here, the light is in a medium. So, in the glass, the speed is c/n as measured in the glass's rest frame.
