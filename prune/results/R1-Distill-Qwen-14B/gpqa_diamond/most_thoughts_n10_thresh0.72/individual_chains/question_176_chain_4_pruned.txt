Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's three elements, so it's a 3x1 vector. So the state vector is in a three-dimensional space, probably because the system is in a three-level state, like an qutrit or something similar.

The operators for observables P and Q are given as square matrices. Let me look at P first. The matrix for P has first row elements (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, that's interesting. I think this matrix might be symmetric, which is good because observable operators are usually Hermitian.

The matrix for Q is diagonal. The first row is (1, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0, 0, -1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, and -1.

The question is asking about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P. So the measurement order is P first, then Q. So I need to find the probability that when you measure P, you get 0, and then measure Q and get -1.

Wait, how does the order of measurements affect this? Oh right, because measuring P first will change the state of the system. So after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses into the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P. Then, measuring Q in that state will give the probability of getting -1.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. The order is important. The question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the process is: first measure P, then measure Q in the new state. So the probability is the product of the probability of getting 0 in P multiplied by the probability of getting -1 in Q given that P was 0.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the state after P is measured (assuming we got 0) is the projection onto the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0. Then in that state, we measure Q. So the probabilities are dependent on the state after the first measurement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, no, the measurement is P first, then Q. So first, the state is |Ïˆ>, then after measuring P, the state becomes |p>, an eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, in |p>, we measure Q to get -1.

So first, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, compute the probability that the initial state collapses into that eigenvector when measuring P. Then, for that eigenvector, calculate
