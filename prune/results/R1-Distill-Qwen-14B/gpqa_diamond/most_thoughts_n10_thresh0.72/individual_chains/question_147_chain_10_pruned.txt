Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. So the question is about protons and antiprotons annihilating into two particles each, like A+ and A-.

The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, no, the question says 2A⁺ and 2A⁻? Or maybe it's different. Oh, right, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So when they annihilate, they produce two A+ and two A- particles. Interesting.

The given data is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV/c². And we're supposed to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Wait, but why is the antiproton moving slowly? Oh, maybe because it's not moving at high speeds, so perhaps we can approximate using non-relativistic methods. Or maybe we need to consider the conservation of energy and momentum, but with the assumption that the antiproton's speed is low, so maybe some terms can be neglected.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, does that mean that the system's total energy is dominated by the rest mass energy, or maybe that the kinetic energy is low? Alternatively, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy, so we can use conservation of energy and momentum in some way.

Wait, but in annihilation processes, the energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the total momentum of the system is just the momentum of the antiproton, and the proton is at rest? Or is the proton also moving? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, it's not entirely clear whether the proton is at rest or moving. Oh wait, in the standard scenario, particles like protons and antiprotons collide at high energies, but here the antiproton is slow-moving, so perhaps the proton is at rest. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe
