Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR of the crude compound mostly matches what's expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts, their integrals add up to 1H, and it's not spin-spin coupling causing them. Hmm, wait, the question says I can rule out spin-spin coupling based on the coupling pattern. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spec, which matches the expected molecule. So the mass is correct, but there are two peaks. What does that mean?

Let me think about possible explanations. The options are A to D. Let's go through each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different molecular weight, right? But the question says the LC-MS shows the same mass. So the mass is correct, which would suggest it's not a different compound like a precursor. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would have the same molecular weight, so LC-MS would show one peak if it's a racemic mixture because they have the same mass. Wait, but LC-MS usually separates enantiomers if the column is chiral, but if it's a regular column, they would co-elute. Oh, but the question says the LC-MS was done at elevated temperature. Hmm, but I'm not sure about how temperature affects that. Wait, the question says both peaks have the same mass. Enantiomers have the same mass spec. So if it's a racemic mixture, under normal LC conditions (without a chiral column), they would elute together, giving a single peak. But if the LC uses a chiral column, then they would separate. But the question says two peaks of equal intensity. So maybe if the column is chiral, then two peaks would show as they're enantiomers. But I'm not sure. Let me think more.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide-bond forming. Wait, what's that? Maybe like if two amide bonds formed in a way that causes some coupling. But in NMR, if there's coupling, you would see splitting. But the question says the two peaks are for the same alpha proton, and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin. So maybe this is about something else. Or maybe it's about isomerism.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so in NMR, they would show as two separate signals. But wait, in this case, the alpha proton is the same for both diastereomers? No, wait. For diastereomers, some protons might be equivalent and others not. But if the alpha proton is in a different environment, then they would split into two. But
