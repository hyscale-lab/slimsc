Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about selecting the right reagents for some reactions. Let me read it carefully and think it through step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different A and B.

Hmm, I remember that reactions involving ketones and nitriles might be nucleophilic substitutions. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, under what conditions does that happen?

Wait, I think the formation of a nitrile from a ketone typically involves a substitution. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. Oh, but wait, ketones usually don't undergo nucleophilic substitution easily because the carbonyl is not a good leaving group. Unless... unless it's an enol or something else.

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's a condensation reaction? Or perhaps the NaCN is acting as a nucleophile in a different context. Oh! Wait a second. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide under certain conditions, it can undergo a
