Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reactions with mCPBA and then looking at the products using HPLC. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the question says a chemist does two reactions. Reaction 1 is with (E)-oct-4-ene and mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 2 is the same but with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then the products are combined, and they run them on two HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

Wait, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? It's commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is an oxidation reaction where the double bond becomes an epoxide. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide.

But wait, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene matters here. For each reaction, the starting material is either E or Z oct-4-ene. So their structures are different.

Let me draw the structures. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end. So E and Z isomer.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA â†’ epoxide. Then aqueous acid. Oh, wait, mCPBA is an oxidizing agent, so it forms an epoxide. Then, after that, what happens when you treat with aqueous acid? Oh, acid would cause the epoxide to undergo ring-opening. Wait, but wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide, which is a three-membered ring. Then, in acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens. So the product after acid workup would be a diol.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the epoxide is formed, and the structure depends on the starting alkene. So in (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5. The groups on each end are CH2CH2 and CH2CH2, but in E configuration, the higher priority groups are opposite. Wait, the exact structure might not matter, but the diastereomerism after epoxidation and ring-opening might
