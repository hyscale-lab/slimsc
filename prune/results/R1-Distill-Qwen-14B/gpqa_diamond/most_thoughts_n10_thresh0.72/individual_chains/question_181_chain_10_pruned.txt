Okay, so I've got a question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to piece this together.

The question is about the flux of neutrinos reaching Earth and the ratio between two energy bands, 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. The setup is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago, while everything else stayed the same. We need to find the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I, II, and III probably refer to different steps in this process. I think pp-III is the dominant part, producing a lot of neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly through the beta-plus decay during the fusion reactions. Oh right, in the proton-proton chain, two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton combines to form helium-3, and then two helium-3s combine into helium-4. Along the way, positrons and neutrinos are emitted.

Wait, the specific part that produces neutrinos is when a boron-8 (maybe) captures a proton to form something, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the decay steps in the pp chain that release neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, does that mean all the neutrinos from that process stop being emitted? That would affect the total neutrino flux we receive.

The Sun's neutrino flux is measured in events per cmÂ² per second. If the pp-III stops, the flux from that source would drop off. But other sources, like the CNO cycle, continue unaffected.

Wait, but the CNO cycle contributes less to the solar neutrinos than the proton-proton chain. I think the proton-proton chain is the main contributor, especially for the lower energy neutrinos.

So, the main neutrino flux comes from the pp chain, and if the pp-III stops, the flux from that channel drops. But the CNO cycle (which is more for higher mass stars, but the Sun does have some) continues. But the CNO neutrinos are probably of higher energy.

Wait, no, wait. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos? Or lower? I'm a bit fuzzy
