Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The problem says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, each with the molecular formula C10H14. Wait, wait. Wait, molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think, benzene has C6H6. So each compound is a disubstituted benzene with two substituents, each probably being a methyl group because adding two methyl groups would give C8H10. Wait, but the formula is C10H14. Hmm, that's not matching. Oh wait, maybe the substituents are ethyl groups. Wait, wait. Let me calculate. Benzene is C6H6. Suppose each substituent is a CH2CH3 (ethyl). Then each ethyl adds two carbons and five hydrogens (since each CH2CH3 has two CH2 groups: CH2CH3 has two carbons and five hydrogensâ€”wait, no, each CH2CH3 group contributes two carbons and five hydrogens? No, wait, ethyl is C2H5, which has 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens. But when attached to benzene, it's C2H5, so each substituent is C2H5. So two substituents would add 4 carbons and 10 hydrogens. Benzene is C6H6. So total would be C6+4=10, H6 +10=16. But the formula is C10H14. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a methyl group. Wait, C6H6 plus two CH3 groups would be C8H8 + 2 H from benzene? Wait, no, each CH3 is adding 3 H. Two CH3 groups would add 6 H. Benzene is 6 H. So 6 + 6 =12 H. But the formula is C10H14. So that's not matching. Wait, perhaps each substituent is a isopropyl group? Isopropyl is C3H7. Two substituents would add 6
