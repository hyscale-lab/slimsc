Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about observables and measurements in quantum systems.

The question says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's three elements, so it's a 3x1 column vector. I'm assuming this is a normalized state vector. Let me check: the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1 if it's normalized. So (-1)^2 is 1, (2)^2 is 4, and (1)^2 is 1. Adding these gives 1+4+1 = 6. Oh, wait, that's 6, not 1. So the vector isn't normalized. I think I need to normalize it before proceeding. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized.

So the first thing I should do is normalize the state vector. The vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector |ψ> is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Next, the observable is represented by matrix P. The matrix P is given as:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, let me write that out properly. So P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

I should check if P is a Hermitian matrix because observables must be represented by Hermitian operators. Let's see: The elements should satisfy P_ij = P_ji*. Since all the elements in P are real, the matrix is symmetric. So yes, it's Hermitian. That makes sense.

Now, the problem is to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one is zero, then find the corresponding eigenvector, and compute the probability as the square of the amplitude of this eigenvector in the state |ψ>.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without diagonalizing the entire matrix.

Alternatively, I can think of P as a projection operator. But looking at the matrix, it's not obvious if it's a projection. Wait, let's compute P squared. If P^2 = P, then it's a projection matrix. Let me see:

Compute P squared. Let's compute element (1,1) of P^2. It's the dot product of row 1 of P and column 1 of P. Row 1 is [0, 1/√2, 0]. Column 1 is [0, 1/√2, 0]^T. So (0)(0) + (1/√2)(1/√2) + (0)(0) )= 1/2.

Similarly, for (1,2) element, it's row 1 of P times column 2 of P. Row 1 is [0, 1/√2, 0], column 2 is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]^T. So 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication
