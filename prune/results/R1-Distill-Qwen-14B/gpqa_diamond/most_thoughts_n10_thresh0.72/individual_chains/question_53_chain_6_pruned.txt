Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is. We've got a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that tells me there's an ester functional group present. Ester groups usually have strong absorption around 1740-1710 cm^-1 in IR, so that makes sense.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let me parse those:

- Two aromatic H signals. So, the aromatic ring has two sets of protons. Maybe para-substituted? Or perhaps ortho and para in a way that creates different environments. Wait, but it's di-substituted, so two substituents.

- Two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, like in an alkene. A doublet suggests maybe coupling with one neighboring proton, and a doublet of quartets is a bit more complex. Hmm, could this be part of an ester group? Because esters have a carbonyl and an adjacent CH2, but maybe the vinyl is part of a substituent attached to the ring.

Wait, the aromatic substituents could be ester groups. Let me think: in an aromatic ester, like a benzene ring with an ester substituent. For example, something like phenyl acetate or similar. But wait, in that case, the substituents would be -O-CO-O-R or something else? No, wait, esters are typically R-O-CO-R', so maybe the substituent is an acyloxy group.

Wait, but the NMR has signals for -CH3 groups. Two signals for -CH3, each. So perhaps there are two different methyl groups. Let me think about the structure. An ester has a R-O-CO-R' group. Maybe one R is a methyl, and the R' is something else.

Wait, the NMR also mentions that there are no CH2 signals. So the compound doesn't have any methylene groups. So where are the CH3's coming from? Maybe two different methyl groups attached to the ester or other parts.

Let me try to sketch a
