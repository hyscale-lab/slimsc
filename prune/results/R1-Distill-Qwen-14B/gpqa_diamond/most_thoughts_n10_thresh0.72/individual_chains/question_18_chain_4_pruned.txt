Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. Using the Equivalent Width (EW) method under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), astronomers have determined some elemental abundances. The given values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → So log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, the ratio of silicon atoms would be [n_Si_Star1 / n_Si_Star2], right?

Hmm. So I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio.

Wait, but the question gives us [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], but not [Si/H]. So I'll probably have to use these abundance ratios to find [Si/H] for each star.

Let me think about how these abundance ratios work. The brackets [X/Y] represent log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun, right? So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Alternatively, sometimes it's defined as log (n_X/n_Y) - log (n_X/n_Y)_sun, so it's the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun.

Wait, another approach: the solar values are given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

Similarly, nMg/nH =1e-5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe/nH)_star1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0. Therefore, log(nFe/nH)_star1 = same as Sun. So nFe/nH for Star_1 is 1e-4.5, same as Sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So for Star_2, nMg/nH is same as Sun → 1e-
