Okay, I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ in the given Lagrangian and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Let's start by recalling some basics.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. 

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian must be mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Because when you integrate the Lagrangian density over spacetime, the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the Lagrangian density itself has mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Because when you integrate L d^4x, the integral is dimensionless (since action is dimensionless), and d^4x has dimension -4 (since each x is dimension 1, so x^4 is 4). So L must have dimension 4.

So each term in L is dimension 4. So the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} must have dimension 4.

Now, let's compute the mass dimensions of each component.

First, let's think about the fields. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the Dirac spinor has dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So [ψ] = 3/2. So ψ̄ also has dimension 3/2.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor of a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The field strength F has the same dimension as the gauge field A, right? Wait, A has dimension 1. Because the gauge field term in the Lagrangian is like F squared, which would be (mass)^4. Wait, wait. Let me think. The field strength tensor F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each derivative ∂ brings dimension 1. A has dimension 1, so each term in F is ∂ A, which is dimension 1 +1 =2. So F has dimension 2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The field strength tensor F is constructed from the gauge field A. The covariant derivative is ∂ + i g A. Each A has to have the same dimension as ∂, because the terms are added. Wait, ∂ has dimension 1 (since it's a derivative with respect to x, which has dimension 1). So A must have dimension 1. So when you take F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, each term has dimension (∂)(A) → 1 +1 = 2.
