Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that an electron is traveling along the x-direction at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy, ΔE. The options are given in different orders of magnitude, so I think I need to compute the value and see which option it matches.

Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Oh right, the principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. The formula I recall is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes it's written with just ħ instead of dividing by 2. I think the exact inequality can vary, but since the question is about an estimate, maybe the approximation is sufficient.

So the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, can be found from Δx. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But sometimes people use ħ ≈ h/(2π), so maybe I can approximate it as 1e-34 J·s for simplicity, considering this is an estimate.

Wait, the problem is asking for the energy uncertainty. Oh right, because energy is related to momentum. Since the electron is moving, its momentum is p = mv, where m is the mass of the electron. The energy here would be kinetic energy, so KE = p²/(2m). But since we're dealing with uncertainties, I think I should relate Δp to ΔE.

Wait, maybe another approach. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, but that's when considering time-energy uncertainty. But the problem here gives a position uncertainty, so perhaps it's better to stick with the position-momentum uncertainty and then relate that to energy.

Let me think. So the momentum uncertainty Δp is approximately ħ
