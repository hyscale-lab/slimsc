Alright, I'm trying to solve this genetics question about mutations in a gene that causes an anti-nutritional compound in barley. So, let me break it down step by step.

Okay, the problem says that the gene has five exons and four introns. The wild-type sequence is provided, and each mutant has some changes in the first exon area. I need to figure out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I'm guessing this involves disrupting the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the options, all the mutants have changes in the first part of the gene. I remember that exons are the coding regions, so any mutation here could affect the protein product. Let me compare each mutant's sequence with the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. So the first few nucleotides are ATGTTTCTC... .

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. Let me see where the change is. Comparing each base:

Original: 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 
Mutant 1: 5' ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, looking at the third codon. Original has TTT (which is Phe), then next is CTC (Leu). In Mutant1, the third codon is TCT (Ser), and the fourth is TAC. Wait, no, let me look again. Let me index the first few bases.

Original: positions 1-30 or so. Let me write them out:

Positions 1-15: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT (so that's 15 bases: ATG is 1-3, TTT 4-6, CTC 7-9, etc.)

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, so at position 4-6: TTT in wild, but TTC in mutant1. Oh wait, no. Let me look again. Original is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1 is ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT... So the first codon is same (ATG), second codon is TTT in wild, which is Phe, but in Mutant1 it's TTC, which is also Phe. So no change there. Third codon: wild is CTC (Leu), mutant1 is TAC (Tyr). Wait, that's a change.

Wait, so the third codon in wild is CTC (Leu), but in Mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr). That's a substitution from C to A in the third position of the third codon.

So, the change is
