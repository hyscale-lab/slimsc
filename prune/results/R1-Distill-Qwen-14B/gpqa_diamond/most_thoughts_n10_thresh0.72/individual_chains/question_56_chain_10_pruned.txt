Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options are about the possible transition routes and their probabilities. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels through emission or absorption of photons, and dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules for dipole transitions again? Oh right, for an electron transition to be allowed via a dipole transition, the change in the angular momentum quantum number (Δl) should be ±1. And the magnetic quantum number (m) can change by 0, ±1. Also, the principal quantum number (n) can change by any integer, but in practice, we usually see transitions where n changes by 1, but wait, no, I think that's not correct. Let me think again. Wait, the selection rules for hydrogen are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1, but Δn can be any integer except zero. So in this case, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0.

So the transition from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 occurs via two steps. Each step is a dipole transition. So first, it goes from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state, and then from that state to 1,0,0.

In each step, the selection rules apply. Let's think about the first transition. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The possible allowed transitions would have l changing by ±1. So from l=0, the next possible is l=1. So in the first dipole transition, the electron can go from n=3, l=0 to either n=2 or n=4, but since the final state is n=1, it's more likely to involve a step down. So maybe 3→2 first.

Wait, let me outline possible first steps. From |3,0,0⟩, the possible l after transition is l=1 because Δl=±1. So the first state must have l=1. So possible states are
