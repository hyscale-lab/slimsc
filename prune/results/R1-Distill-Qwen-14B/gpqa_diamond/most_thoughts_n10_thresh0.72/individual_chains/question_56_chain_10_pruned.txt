Okay, so I have this physics problem about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the |3,0,0⟩ state decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions are governed by the selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for dipole transitions. I think for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Wait, but for the m component, it's m can change by 0, ±1.

So, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. They decay to n=1, l=0, m=0. Since it's a two-step process, probably the state goes through an intermediate state.

So first, from |3,0,0⟩, what can it transition to? Let's think. The initial l is 0. So for dipole transition, l must change by ±1. So the next l must be 1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition: n=3, l=0 → n= something, l=1. What's possible for n? Well, n can decrease by 1, maybe. Because going from 3 to 2 is a possible step. Or maybe higher, but let's see. Because in two steps, from 3 to 1, so we probably go through 3→2 and then 2→1.

So intermediate state is |2,1,m⟩. What's the possible m values? The initial m is 0, so the next m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible m for the intermediate state are -1, 0, +1.

So the possible first transitions are |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. But wait, wait. Let me get that right. The initial m is 0. So m can go to m±1, but wait, no, the selection rule is Δm = 0, ±1. So from m=0, you can go to m=0, +1, or -1.

Wait, but in the first transition, the state goes from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩. So for the first transition, the possible ms are 0, +1, -1. So possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition takes us from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but the second transition must also follow the selection rules. So from the intermediate state (l=1, m=?), we need to transition to l=0, and m=0.

So from l=1, we can go to l=0 (since Δl= -1). So that's allowed.

But what about m? The intermediate state could have m=0, ±1. So when going to m=0 again, let's see:

If the intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩, then in the second transition, m can go to m=0 (so Δm=0), which is allowed. So |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is allowed.

If the intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩, then for the second transition, m must change from 1 to 0. That's a Δm of -1, which is allowed.

Similarly, if the intermediate is |2,1,-1⟩, then m can change from -1 to 0, which is Δm=+1. So all three possibilities are allowed.

But the problem states that the decay is via two dipole transitions. So the possible paths are through these three intermediates.

Wait, but the options given are specific. Let me look at the options
