Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my statistical mechanics, but I'll try to recall.

The problem says there are three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). Right, so each state contributes a term based on its energy.

Let me think about the states. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the energy expression. E is -J times the sum of the products of each pair. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me define H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J H. Then, the exponent in the partition function will be β E = -β J H. So each term in Z will be exp(β J H), because the partition function is sum exp(-β E) = sum exp(β J H).

Wait, no: E = -J (H), so -β E = β J H. So each term is exp(β J H). So Z = sum_{all states} exp(β J H), where H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the possible values of H, and count how many states give each H. Then, for each H, compute exp(β J H) multiplied by the number of states with that H.

So, first, I need to find the possible values of H for each state. Let's see.

Each S_i is either +1 or -1. So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. For example, S1S2 can be
