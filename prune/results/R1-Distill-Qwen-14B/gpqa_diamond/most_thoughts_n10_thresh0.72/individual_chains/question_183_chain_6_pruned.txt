Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency for the product formed after a specific reaction. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂, but wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so maybe it's attached as a substituent. Oh wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So, the ring is numbered such that the double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, substituents are at 2 and 5.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring (double bond between C3 and C4). On C2, a formyl group (CHO) is attached, and on C5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH- as a substituent. So the substituent is a vinyl group, which is -CH₂-CH₂? No, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so attached as CH₂-CH₂? Or as CH₂-CH₂? No, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH–, so the substituent is a vinyl group, which is itself a double bond. So the compound has multiple double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (double bond) and the vinyl group's double bond. Also, the formyl group has a double bond (CHO).

Wait, let me count the rings and double bonds. The overall molecule: cyclohexene (one ring, one double bond), formyl group (another double bond), and the vinyl group (another double bond). So that's three double bonds, and one ring. Wait, but the index of hydrogen deficiency is the sum of rings and double bonds. So the original molecule has 3 rings or double bonds? Wait, the cyclohexene is a ring with one double bond. So the molecule has one ring (the cyclohexene) and two other double bonds (the formyl's C=O and the vinyl's C=C). So in the original molecule, index of hydrogen deficiency is 1 (ring) + 2 (double bonds) = 3.

But wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the substituents are on the ring. Let me think again: the ring is cyclohexene (so one double bond). Then, the formyl group has a carbonyl (another double bond). The vinyl group is another double bond (CH₂=CH–). So that's three double bonds in the original compound. Plus, the ring is a ring, which is a ring structure (so that's another "ring" but the double bond in the ring is already counted as a double bond, right? Wait, no. The index counts each ring as one and each double bond as another. So in the cyclohexene, it's a ring (counts as 1) and a double bond (counts as 1), but wait, no, because the cyclohexene already is a ring with one double bond. So that's 2 (1 for ring, 1 for double bond?), but wait, no. The formula for index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But in this case, perhaps it's easier to count rings and double bonds.

Wait, the starting molecule: cyclohexene has a ring and a double bond
