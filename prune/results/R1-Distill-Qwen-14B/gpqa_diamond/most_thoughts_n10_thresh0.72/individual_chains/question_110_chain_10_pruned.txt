Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about stars and which ones can be detected by two specific spectrographs. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the question mentions two spectrographs: ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the Keck Observatory. The key points are their brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So any star that is brighter than 17 mag (which is fainter) can't be seen by ESPRESSO, but if it's brighter than 16 mag, it can be seen by HIRES. Wait, no—the wording is a bit confusing. Let me re-read.

Oh right, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So apparent V magnitude less than 17, since lower magnitudes are brighter. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So, if a star is brighter than 17 (apparent magnitude ≤17), it can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 (apparent mag ≤16), because 16 is brighter than 17. Wait, no. Wait, magnitudes work in reverse: the lower the number, the brighter the object. So a star with V magnitude 16 is brighter than one with 17.

So, for each spectrograph:

ESPRESSO: V ≤17 mag (can observe up to 17)
HIRES: V ≤16 mag (can observe up to 16, which is brighter, so more stars are brighter than 17 than 16, right? No, wait. Wait, no. Because if something is brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17. So the stars that can be observed by both would be those that are brighter than 17, but HIRES can see brighter stars, so the overlapping would be stars that are brighter than 17? Or do I have this backwards.

Wait, let me think again. If a star's apparent magnitude is brighter (lower number) than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. If it's brighter than 16, HIRES can see it. So, a star that's brighter than 16 would satisfy both, right? Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17, so it can be observed by both. But a star with apparent magnitude 17 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, and a star with 16.5 can be seen by both? Wait, no. The way the question is phrased: ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag
