Okay, so I need to figure out which transition path is correct for the H-atom state decay. The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that in hydrogen atom transitions, electrons change energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons. Dipole transitions are governed by selection rules, right?

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen, the quantum numbers change as follows: Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., I think. But specifically, the selection rules are Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, there's the condition that l cannot be zero, so s electrons (l=0) don't transition via dipole emission.

The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. So it's a 3s orbital. It decays to 1s (n=1, l=0, m=0). So how does it go from 3s to 1s in two steps?

Each transition must follow the selection rules. So first, |3,0,0⟩ → some intermediate state → |1,0,0⟩. Let me think about possible intermediates.

First transition: n must decrease by 2? Or maybe 3→2→1. Because 3→1 would require Δn = -2, but for dipole transitions, I think Δn can be any integer except 0, but for two transitions, it would be two steps. So maybe n=3 →n=2 →n=1.

So first transition from n=3 to n=2. Now, what about l? Since the initial l is 0, the first transition must have l change by ±1, so l becomes 1. Because from l=0, you can only go to l=1 (since l can't be negative and must be integer). So first state after transition is |2,1, m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Then, from n=2, l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. The next transition must go to n=1, l=0. So from l=1, it must go to l=0 (Δl = -1). So that's allowed.

So the possible intermediates are |2,1,m⟩ where m is -1, 0, +1. Then, from there, they go to |1,0,0⟩. Wait, but from m=1, can you go to m=0? Because the second transition's m must change by 0, ±1. So for the second transition, m can change by -1, 0, +1.

So let's think about possible paths.

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 →1,0,0.

That's possible. Let's check selection rules. First transition: n changes from 3→2 (Δn=-1), which is allowed. l from 0→1 (Δl=+1), which is allowed. m from 0→0: Δm=0, allowed. Then second transition: n=2→1 (Δn=-1), allowed. l=1→0 (Δl=-1), allowed. m=0→0, allowed. So that path is possible.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 →1,0,0.

First transition: m goes from 0 to 1 (Δm=+1), allowed. Second transition: from m=1 to m=0 (Δm=-1), allowed. So that's also possible.

Same with option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0. First transition m changes from 0→-1 (Δm=-1), allowed. Then m=-1 →0 (Δm=+1), allowed. So that's possible too.

So all options A, B, C, and D (if any) have possible transitions. Wait, what about the probabilities?

The question states it's via two dipole transitions, and the option gives the transition probability as a fraction. So which of these options has a probability of 1/3, 1/4, etc.

I remember that the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix elements, which involve the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the Wigner 3-j symbols. The probability for each transition path is proportional to the product of the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for each step.

Alternatively, since the initial state is s-state (l=0), the first transition to l=1 can have m=-1, 0, +1. Each with certain probabilities.

The allowed m transitions are from m_initial to m_initial ±1 or same. So from m=0, possible m in the next state are -1, 0, +1. So three possibilities. Each has a certain probability.

Wait, but what are the selection rules for m? The photon carries away angular momentum, so the change in m can be -1, 0, +1, but in practice, for dipole transitions, only Δm=0, ±1 are allowed.

So the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ can go to any |2,1, m'⟩ where m' is -1,0, +1.

The probability of each m' depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the transition.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding angular momenta: from l=0 (s) and the photon’s angular momentum (which is 1 for a dipole). The possible transitions are from l=0 to l=1, so the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients involve how the m's add.

The possible coefficients are non-zero when m' = m_initial + 0, ±1. But m_initial is 0, so m' can be 0, ±1.

The coefficients for each m' are | CG(0,0; 1, m') |².

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling l=0 and l'=1 to get l=1. So for adding 0 and 1 to get 1, the coefficients can be calculated.

The formula for CG coefficients is:

CG(l1, m1; l2, m2; L, M) = ... well, for our case, l1=0, m1=0; l2=1, m2=m'; L=1, M=0.

Wait, no. Wait, when the atom emits a photon, the photon has angular momentum 1, which is involved in the transition. So the initial state is |n, l, m⟩, and the photon carries away angular momentum with l_photon=1, m_photon= m_photon.

So the transition involves combining the initial state's angular momentum and the photon's to get the final state's angular momentum.

So the matrix elements involve:

⟨f| r · ε ⟩,

where ε is the photon's polarization, which has angular momentum components. So for each component of ε, we get a transition with Δm=0, ±1.

The matrix element for each m' is proportional to CG(0,0; 1, m').

Wait, for the initial state |3,0,0⟩, when it emits a photon, the final state |2,1, m'⟩ must satisfy m' = 0 + m_photon, where m_photon can be -1, 0, +1. So m' can be -1, 0, +1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient CG(0,0; 1, m') is non-zero only for m' = -1, 0, +1.

But what are their magnitudes?

The CG coefficients are given by:

CG(0,0; 1, m) = sqrt( (1 + m) (1 - m) ) / sqrt(2*(1*(1+1))) )? Wait, not exactly sure, but I think for l=0 and l_photon=1:

The CG coefficients for adding l=0 (m=0) and l_photon=1 (m_photon) to get l=1 (m'):

Wait, the sum is:

m' = m_initial + m_photon.

So in our case, m_initial=0, so m' = m_photon.

But the CG coefficient is for the addition of l=0 and l_photon=1 to form the state with L=1, M=m'.

So the CG coefficients for (0,0) and (1, m_photon) combining to (1, m').

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The initial state is |l=0, m=0⟩, and the photon has |l_photon=1, m_photon⟩. The final state is |l=1, m'=m_photon⟩, because m' = m_initial + m_photon.

So for each m_photon, which will be -1,0,+1, we'll have a transition to m' = m_photon.

The square of the CG coefficient for each m_photon is |CG(0,0; 1, m_photon) |².

The CG coefficient for adding l=0 and l'=1 to get l=1, M=m_photon.

The formula for CG coefficients when adding two angular momenta: 

CG(j1, m1; j2, m2; J, M) = sqrt( ( (J+M)! (J-M)! (j1 + j2 - J)! ) / ( (j1 + j2 + J)! (j1 - j2 + J)! ) ) ) * (-1)^... something, but perhaps it's easier to look up specific values.

Alternatively, I remember that for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1, the CG coefficients are:

For m_photon = +1:

CG(0,0;1,1;1,1) = 1/sqrt(2), because the state |1,1⟩ can be written as (|0,0⟩ ⊗ |1,1⟩)/sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, perhaps the correct way is to express |1, m⟩ in terms of |0,0⟩⊗|1,m⟩.

So |1, m⟩ = sum_{m'} CG(1, m; 0,0;1, m') |0,0⟩⊗|1, m'}.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe
