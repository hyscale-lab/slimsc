Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. Wait, dipole transitions... right, that has to do with the selection rules for electromagnetic transitions.

I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions are governed by the electric dipole selection rules. For an electron to transition between energy levels, certain quantum numbers must change by specific amounts. So the selection rules say that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh yeah, and for the principal quantum number n, it can change by ±1 as well, but in a multi-photon transition maybe it can change by more? Wait, no, each transition (photon emission or absorption) can only change n by one. So if we're going from n=3 to n=1, that's a two-photon process. So the decay is via two steps, each changing n by 1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0> with n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It decays to |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0, m=0. So the first step must go from n=3 to n=2, and then n=2 to n=1.

Now, what are the possible l and m values for each intermediate state? Let's think about the first transition: from l=0 to l=1, because Δl must be ±1. So from l=0, the next possible l is 1. So the first intermediate state would be |2,1,m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the possible first steps are |3,0,0> → |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>. Then, from each of those, the second transition would go to n=1, l=0.

Wait, but the second transition must obey Δl=±1 as well. So from l=1, you can go to l=0 or l=2. But the target is l=0, so that's allowed. So the second transition should have l=1 → l=0. So the second state must have l=0.

Wait, but the target is |1
