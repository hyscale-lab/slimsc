Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I don't think the masses are directly relevant here. The question is about the elemental abundances. 

The given data are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. Oh right, these are abundance ratios. The brackets mean it's a logarithm base 10 of the ratio of the element's abundance relative to another element. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So Fe abundance relative to H is same as solar.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Mg abundance relative to H is same as solar.

Wait, and the Sun's composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let me parse that. So 12 + log10(nFe/nH_sun) = 7.5? Or is it the value of log10(nFe/nH)? Wait, the notation is a bit unclear. Let me think. Oh, I think the standard notation is that the solar abundance is given as 12 + log10(n_X/n_H) for each element. So for the Sun, 12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5. So that would make log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So n_Fe/n_H = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, 12 + log10(n_Mg/n_H) =7, so log10 is -5, so n_Mg/n_H = 1e-5.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon in the two stars. So I think I need to find [Si/Fe] for each star, but probably more about how to get n_Si relative to H in each star.

Wait, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2) or (n_Si_2 / n_Si_1)? No, wait, the ratio would be, I think, (n_Si in Star_1) / (n_Si in Star_2). Or maybe (n_Si_1 / H_1) divided by (n_Si_2 / H_2), which would be [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2. Hmm, but let me think.

Wait, the problem gives [Mg/Si]_2 and [Si/Fe]_1, but perhaps I can work out the [Si/H] for each star.
