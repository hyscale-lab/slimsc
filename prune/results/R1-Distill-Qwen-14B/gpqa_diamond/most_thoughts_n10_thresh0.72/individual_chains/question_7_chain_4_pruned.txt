Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by this annihilation process. The process is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs, right? So the reaction is γγ → e+ e-. 

I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their mean lifetime can be limited by such processes. The CMB has a certain energy, and in this case, the average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. 

Wait, so the problem is about calculating the gamma-ray energy where this process becomes significant enough to limit the gamma's lifetime. I think this involves calculating the cross-section and the photon density, then finding the mean free path or interaction probability.

I recall that the cross-section for this process might depend on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon. Since the CMB energy is much lower than the gamma-ray's energy, maybe we can approximate the photon energy as much smaller than the gamma's. 

The cross-section formula for pair production via gamma-gamma collisions is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, but s is (E1 + E2)^2? Or is it the product? No, I think s is (E_γ + E_CMB)^2, but since E_CMB is much smaller than E_γ, s ≈ (2 E_γ)^2. 

Wait, more accurately, the Mandelstam variable s is (p1 + p2)^2 c^2. For two photons, each with energy E1 and E2, moving in opposite directions (since they annihilate), s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Since E = |p| c for photons, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. Because (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2 + 4 E2 E1 = 8 E1 E2? Wait, no, let me compute that again. 

(E1 + E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²,
(E1 - E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²,
Subtracting the two, (E1+E2)^2 - (E1-E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. So s = 4 E1 E2. 

But since the CMB photon has energy E2 = 1e-3 eV, and the gamma-ray energy E1 is much higher, so E2 << E1, so s ≈ 4 E1 E2. 

The cross-section σ is then (8π/3) (m_e c^2)^2 / s. So σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (4 E1 E2) )= (2π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2). 

Now, the interaction rate depends on the number density of CMB photons. The photon density n is the number per unit volume. The CMB has a photon density n ≈ a c^3 / (k_B T)^3, where a is the radiation constant (about 4/3 * 1e-23 J m^3/K^3?), and T is the temperature. Wait, but the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV. Let me think about the relation between energy and temperature. 

The average photon energy in the CMB is about 2.7 kT, because for a blackbody spectrum, the average energy is (π²/6) k T, but wait, actually the average energy per photon for a blackbody is (8 pi) / (45) k T (I might be mixing up the exact value, but perhaps it's about 2.7 k T). Wait, maybe it's better to get the photon density in terms of energy. 

Alternatively, the number density of CMB photons is about 411 photons per cm^3 (I remember that number), but let me calculate it. The CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. The photon number density is n_photon ≈ (2ζ(3)/π²) (k_B T)^3 / (h c)^3 ), where ζ(3) is Apéry's constant ≈ 1.202. 

Wait, let's compute it numerically. Let's compute the photon density n. 

k_B (Boltzmann constant) is about 8.617e-5 eV/K. T is 2.7 K, so k_B T ≈ 8.617e-5 eV/K * 2.7 K ≈ 2.326e-4 eV. 

But wait, the average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, which is higher than 2.7 k T. Hmm, wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the average energy is directly given, so E_photon is 1e-3 eV. 

So n_photon can be found using the relation between photon number density and energy density. The energy density u is (8π/15) (k_B T)^4 / (h c)^3 * (e^{...}) but for a blackbody, but perhaps a quicker way is to use the relation u = 4.965e-14 J/m³ * (T/K)^4. But I might have this wrong. Alternatively, the photon density n can be calculated as u / (average photon energy). 

Wait, the average energy of a photon is E_avg = (4/3) k T * (4.965e-14 J/m³) is the energy density. So n = u / E_avg. 

But perhaps it's better to compute n_photon using the formula:

n_photon = (8π/(15)) (k_B T)^3/(h c)^3) * (g_{photon} / (2π^2)) ), where g is the degrees of freedom. For photons, g=2. So n_photon = (8π/(15)) * (k_B T)^3/(h c)^3 * (2/(2π^2)) )? Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, the standard number density is about 411 photons/cm³ at T=2.7 K. 

But perhaps it's easier to use E_photon = 1e-3 eV as the average photon energy, and compute the photon density n_photon as u_photon / E_avg, where u_photon is the energy density. 

The energy density of the CMB is u = (8π/15) (k_B T)^4/(h c)^3 ), but since we have E_photon given, perhaps the average photon energy is E_photon_avg = (u) / (n_photon). So n_photon = u / E_photon_avg.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can find n_photon in terms of E_photon.

Alternatively, the energy density u is about 0.23 eV/m³, but let me compute it. Let me convert the known values. 

I know that the CMB energy density is approximately 0.23 eV/m³. Since the average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, the number density n_photon is u / E_avg = 0.23 eV/m³ / 1e-3 eV = 230,000 photons/m³. 

Wait, 0.23 / 1e-3 is 230. So 230 per cubic meter, which is 230 per 1e6 liters. Wait, but that's 230 per m³. To convert to cm³, 1 m³ is 1e6 liters? No, 1 m³ is 1e6 liters? No, wait: 1 m³ = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So 230 per m³ is 230 per 1e6 cm³, which is 2.3e-4 per cm³. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the CMB photon density is about 411 photons per cm³. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting numbers here. Maybe I made a mistake in the energy density.

Wait, perhaps the energy density is about 1e-13 J/m³. Let me compute that in eV/m³. 1 J = 6.242e18 eV. So 1e-13 J/m³ is 6.242e5 eV/m³. That
