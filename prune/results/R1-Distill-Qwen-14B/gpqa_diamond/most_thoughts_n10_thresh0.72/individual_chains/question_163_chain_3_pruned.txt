Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. We want to know the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to do this. Additionally, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values and volumes.

First, I think I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have and what reactions happen when it dissolves in acid. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and when it reacts with a strong acid, it will neutralize the hydroxide ions, probably producing water and the corresponding salt.

So, the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ ions. Let me write that out:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, yeah, because each OH- in Fe(OH)3 (there are three) will react with H+ to form water. So the stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles of H+.

Okay, now I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... Let's see: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So for Fe(OH)3, it's 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.0009359 moles, so about 9.359e-4 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:3, the moles of H+ needed will be 3 * 9.359e-4 ≈ 0.0028077 moles.

Wait, but the acid is monobasic and strong. So the concentration is 0.1 M, which means moles per liter. Wait, 0.1 M is 0.1 moles per liter (1000 cm³). Since each mole of acid provides one mole of H+ (because it's monobasic), then the volume of acid needed is moles needed divided by concentration.

So volume needed = moles H+ / 0.1 M. Let's compute that. 0.0028077 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.028077 dm³, which is 28.077 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options have around 28 cm³ as option C, but I need to check more accurately.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the molar masses. Let me recalculate Fe(OH)3. Fe is 55.845 g/mol, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So each OH group is 17.008 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.845 + 3*(17.008) = 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol.
