Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Wait, actually, nu is a neutrino, right? So the pion is decaying into a muon and a neutrino. I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and in particle physics, when a particle decays, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is initially at rest, that might simplify things a bit.

The rest masses are given: the Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, wait, the neutrino's mass is usually considered negligible, especially in these kinds of problems. So I can probably treat the neutrino as massless for this calculation. That should make the math easier.

The problem is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So I guess I need to find how much kinetic energy each of the muon and neutrino has after the decay. 

I remember that in decay processes, the total energy is conserved. The initial energy of the pion is just its rest mass energy because it's stationary. So the initial energy E_initial is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. 

After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy will just be its kinetic energy since its rest mass is nearly zero. 

So, E_initial = E_muon + E_neutrino. 

But wait, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products should be zero because momentum is conserved. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is -p. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to the magnitude of its momentum times c (well, in units where c=1, it's just p). So E_neutrino = |p| * c. Again, if we're using units where c=1, it's just p. 

For the muon, its energy E_muon is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of units where c=1 to simplify. So E_muon = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). 

So the initial energy is just m_pi. The sum of E_muon and E_neutrino is m_pi. 

So we can write: 

m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p 

Because E_neutrino is p (since m_nu is zero). 

Let me write that equation again:

m_pi = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p 

I need to solve for p. Once I have p, I can find E_muon and E_neutrino, and from there the kinetic energies. 

Let me rearrange the equation:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p 

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + m_mu² = (m_pi - p)^2 

Expanding the right side: 

p² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p² 

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p 

Rearranged:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu² 

So,

p = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi) 

Hmm, let me plug in the numbers. 

m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So,

m_pi² = (139.6)^2 = let me calculate that. 139.6 squared. 

Well, 140 squared is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16. So approximately 19488.16 (MeV)^2.

m_mu squared is 105.7 squared. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49. 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 (MeV)^2.

So,

m_pi² - m_mu² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 (MeV)^2.

Divide by (2 m_pi): 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's see.

Let me compute that: 279.2 * 29 = let's see. 279 * 30 = 8370. So 279.2 * 29 is 8096.8. Hmm, wait, but 279.2 * 29.7 = perhaps? Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me do approximate division.

279.2 is approximately 280. 8315.67 / 280. Let's see: 280 * 29.7 = 8316 (because 280 * 30 is 8400, which is 84 more than 8316, so 30 - (84/280) → 30 - 0.3=29.7). So p ≈ 29.7 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait: units. Since p is in MeV/c, and since c=1 in these units, but when we calculated p in terms of MeV, I'm not sure. Wait, no, in the units where c is not considered, p is in MeV/c. So, after calculation, p is 29.7 MeV/c.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check the calculation:

8315.67 / 279.2 → approximating:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. Our numerator is 8315.67, which is 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87 above 29*279.2.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So 29.783. So approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, in our equation earlier, E_neutrino is p, so that's approximately 29.78 MeV.

E_muon is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) → let's compute that.

p² is (29.78)^2 = approx 886.8 MeV².

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 MeV².

So p² + m_mu² = 886.8 + 11172.49 = 12059.29 MeV².

sqrt(12059.29) = let's see, 109.8 squared is 119.8^2 = approximately 12056. So sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. So E_muon is about 109.8 MeV. So the kinetic energy of muon is E_muon - m_mu, which is 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but wait, wait. The neutrino's energy is p, which is approx 29.78 MeV. So the total energy is E_muon + E_nu = 109.8 + 29.78 ≈ 139.58 MeV, which is close to m_pi's 139.6 MeV. So that makes sense.

So the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.1 MeV, and
