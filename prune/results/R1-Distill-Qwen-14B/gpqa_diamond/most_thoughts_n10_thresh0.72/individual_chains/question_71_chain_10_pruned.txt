Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says there are five planets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, in orbital resonance with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I don't think that part is too relevant here, since the question is about their temperatures.

The orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet's period is longer. Wait, but how exactly are these ratios applied? Like, if the ratio is 1:2, then Planet_2's period is twice Planet_1's. Right.

The question asks about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. And all planets have the same albedo, so albedo doesn't affect the calculation. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since albedo is same, it's only about distance and star's luminosity.

Wait, but the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Oh wait, no, another way: the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period (assuming same star and albedo). Or is it the semi-major axis? Because the period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law.

Wait, let's get this straight. Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³. So a ∝ P^(2/3). So the semi-major axis is proportional to P^(2/3).

Now, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), but I'm a bit rusty. Alternatively, I remember that T is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. But since all planets are around the same star, L is the same for all.

So T ∝ sqrt(1/(a²)) )^(1/2) ? Wait, let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2
