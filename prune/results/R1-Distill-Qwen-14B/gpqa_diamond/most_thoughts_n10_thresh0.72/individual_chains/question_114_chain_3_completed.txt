Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct options for A and B from the given choices.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. Reacting ketones with CN- usually involves nucleophilic addition. When a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, it's probably an example of a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. But wait, adding CN- to a ketone would give a cyanohydrin, right? A cyanohydrin is formed when a nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets a proton.

So the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about that structure. The original ketone is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh wait, but when you add CN- to a ketone, you get the cyanohydrin. But how does this happen? The reaction is usually done under acidic conditions because the carbonyl oxygen needs to be protonated to make the carbonyl more electrophilic. So the reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+ (which is H+ from H3O+), or maybe something else.

Wait, but sometimes H2SO3 or H2S is used in such reactions. Oh wait, no. For the formation of cyanohydrin, the typical conditions are using a strong acid, like H2SO4, or perhaps H3O+ as the proton source. So in the reaction, NaCN is providing the CN- nucleophile, and the acid (H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more reactive. So A is probably H3O+.

Then, looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3 in options A and D. Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite. Oh, wait, maybe I'm confusing this with other reactions. For example, the hydroboration reaction uses H2O or something else. Wait, but in the formation of cyanohydrin, it's typically HCN added to the ketone under acidic conditions. So the reagent A would be H3O+.

So the first part suggests that A is H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I think is not right for this step.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is something like a benzyl-substituted phenyl group attached to a butanenitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. The product is the corresponding butanoic acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH).

How does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. Common reagents include H2O with acid or base, or maybe using something like KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically involves strong acidic or basic conditions, and often heat. For example, using H3O+ (acidic conditions), H2O, and maybe a catalyst. Alternatively, sometimes HCl is used as the acid, or other strong acids.

Wait, another approach: the second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. So it's a hydrolysis. But what conditions are used to hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids? Let me think.

I think in acidic conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. So, H2O in the presence of HCl (acid). Alternatively, maybe H2SO4 is used as the acid.

The product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must have gone all the way. For that, the conditions should be strong acid or strong base. But since water is present, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, the reagent B is H2O. So the reaction is probably with H2O in acidic conditions. So the reagent B would be H2O and HCl, perhaps.

Looking back at the options, for B, options A and C have B as HCl. Options B and D have B as CH3COOH. Wait, but B is given as H2O. So the reagent B is H2O, but the condition might be acidic, so maybe adding HCl as the acid.

Wait, but looking at the question, for the second reaction, the reagent is labeled as B (H2O). So the reagent is H2O, but perhaps in a reaction with an acid. So the options for B (the reagent) are either HCl or another acid.

Wait, the question says that reagent B is H2O, right? Oh, no, sorry. Let me read it again. "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...". Oh, no, wait. The way it's written is that reagent B is H2O. So the reaction is using H2O as the reagent, but perhaps under acidic or other conditions.

Wait, so the second reaction is treating with H2O and some acid. So to get the acid from nitrile, the conditions are hydrolysis. So, the possible reagents would be H2O with HCl. So the reagent B would be HCl, since H2O is already given. Wait, but the options for B in each case are either HCl or CH3COOH.

So looking at the options, option A says B is HCl, option C says B is HCl. So if B is HCl (acidic), then the first part A is H3O+.

Wait, in the first reaction, if A is H3O+ (from option A), then in the second reaction B is HCl, which is option A. But let's check the other parts.

Wait, another thought: the second reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Another method is using H2O under basic conditions, but more commonly, acidic conditions with HCl or H2SO4 are used. So, in the reaction, H2O is present, but for the acid, HCl would be the acid catalyst. So B is HCl.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (acid) and for the second reaction, B is HCl (acid).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → correct for both steps.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → B is acetic acid, which is a weaker acid. Would that be enough for the hydrolysis? Maybe, but I think HCl is more commonly used for this conversion.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → So A isn't H3O+, which I thought was needed for the first reaction.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH → Again, A is NaHSO3, which I don't think is right for the first reaction.

So option A seems to be the correct choice.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: In the first reaction, the reagent is NaCN and A. If A is H3O+, then it's an acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to the ketone. That would form the cyanohydrin. So that makes sense.

In the second reaction, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So, under acidic conditions, the nitrile would first form an amide, then a carboxylic acid. So, in the presence of H2O and HCl (H3O+), the nitrile would hydrolyze.

So yes, options A and C have B as HCl, but option A has A as H3O+.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So if the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl, that's option A.

Wait, but I should double-check. Do I remember any alternative methods for the first reaction? Could it be that NaHSO3 is used instead of H3O+?

NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Wait, but for cyanohydrin formation, it's usually done with HCN and a strong acid. Alternatively, sometimes aqueous ammonia is used, but that's for other reactions. NaHSO3 is more used in reactions like the hydroboration or in the workup steps where it helps protonate things, but I'm not sure it's used as the acid for cyanohydrin formation.

So I think the first part definitely requires an acid, likely H3O+.

So the correct answer should be option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires acidic conditions to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (acid) is the correct reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary acidic environment. Options C and D, which suggest **NaHSO₃** for A, are incorrect because NaHSO₃ is not typically used for this purpose.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This process requires strong acidic or basic conditions. Since the reagent B is explicitly stated as **H₂O**, the reaction must proceed under acidic conditions. **HCl** is the appropriate acid to facilitate this hydrolysis, as it provides the necessary acidic environment to convert the nitrile into a carboxylic acid. Options B and D, which suggest **CH₃COOH** (acetic acid) for B, are less likely because acetic acid is a weaker acid and may not be sufficient for this transformation.

Combining these observations, the correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
