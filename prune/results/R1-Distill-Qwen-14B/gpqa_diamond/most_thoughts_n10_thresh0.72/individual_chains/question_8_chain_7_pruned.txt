Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky for me, but I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that someone did an experiment on white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. Then they made knock-out mutants for each gene and also some double mutants. The idea is to figure out how these genes interact in terms of providing resistance.

The results are given as the resistance percentages of each mutant compared to the wild-type control, which is 100%. The resistance levels are:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

From this, we have to draw a conclusion about the interaction of these genes. The options suggest things like which gene is a transcription factor, if some genes show pleiotropy (which I think means they affect multiple traits, but here it's about resistance), and epistasis—like one gene's effect masks another's.

So, first, I need to understand what the resistance percentages tell us. A lower percentage means the mutant is more susceptible than the wild type. The wild type has 100% resistance, so any mutant with lower resistance is more susceptible.

Let's look at each mutant:

g1: 75% – so less resistance than wild type but not completely susceptible. So G1 may be contributing but not essential. Or maybe it's part of a redundant system.

g2: 0% – so the mutant is completely susceptible. That suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. Maybe it's a transcription factor because if it's knocked out, everything else fails.

g3: 50% – so even worse than g1. So G3 is important but perhaps not as much as G2.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% – both together are as bad as each alone in some cases. Hmm.

g1g3: 10% – which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So together, they're more susceptible than either alone.

g2g3: 0% – same as g2 alone.

Wait, but let's think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Suppose G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would mean neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed. So in that case, g2 alone would have 0% resistance, which matches the result.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% – same as g2. So if G2 is upstream, then even if G1 is knocked out, G2's knockout already makes it 0%.

Similarly, g2g3: 0% same as g2. So that makes sense if G2 is required for both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at g3: 50% resistance. So without G3, resistance is lower but not gone.

g1's resistance is 75%. So without G1, the resistance is lower, but not as bad as without G3 or in the double mutants.

Wait, but what's the interaction between G1 and G3?

Looking at their double mutant: g1g3 is 10% resistance. So without both, it's much worse than either alone. So it's additive or synergistic.

But wait, if G2 is the transcription factor, then G1 and G3 might be downstream targets. Let's think about that.

In the g1 mutant, since G2 is a transcription factor, it's possible that G1 is not expressed. But wait, in the g1 mutant, G2 is present, but the resistance is 75%, which is less than wild type but not 0. So perhaps G2 can activate other genes besides G1 and G3. Or perhaps G1 is not the only target.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 provide some redundant functions.

Wait, let's think about the g1 and g3 single mutants. Without G1, resistance is 75
