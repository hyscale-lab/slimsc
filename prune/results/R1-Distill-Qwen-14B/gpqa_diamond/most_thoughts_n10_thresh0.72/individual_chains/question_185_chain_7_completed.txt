Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me think through this step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon multiplied by the dot product of sigma and n vectors. Oh right, sigma here are the Pauli spin matrices. And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some arbitrary direction.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product with n would mean that H is a combination of these matrices scaled by the components of n. So, if n is (nx, ny, nz), then H = epsilon (nx sigma_x + ny sigma_y + nz sigma_z). Got it.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that the eigenvalues of a spin operator in a magnetic field (which this looks like) are related to its magnitude. Oh wait, more generally, any operator that's a vector in spin space like this will have eigenvalues based on its magnitude.

The Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues plus and minus their magnitude. Wait, each Pauli matrix individually has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you have a linear combination, the eigenvalues depend on the magnitude of the vector.

So for a Hamiltonian H = epsilon (sigma · n), the magnitude of sigma · n would be sqrt(nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2). But since n is a unit vector, that square root is 1. So the magnitude is epsilon multiplied by 1. So the eigenvalues should be plus and minus epsilon, right?

Wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. So when you have sigma · n, its eigenvalues would be ±1 because the vector n is a unit vector. So when you multiply by epsilon, the eigenvalues become ±epsilon. So the eigenvalues are +epsilon and -epsilon.

Looking at the options, option B says plus epsilon and minus epsilon. Option C has epsilon multiplied by hbar over 2. Hmm, why would that be? Oh wait, sometimes when dealing with spin-1/2 particles, you have factors of hbar/2 in the spin matrices. But in this case, the Hamiltonian is given as H = epsilon sigma · n. So if the sigma matrices are multiplied directly by epsilon, the eigenvalues would just be ±epsilon.

Wait, but wait another thing. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're 2x2 matrices. So if epsilon has the dimension of energy, then the Hamiltonian has the correct dimension.

Wait, but in some conventions, when you write the spin operator, it's (hbar/2) sigma · B, where B is a magnetic field, for example. In that case, the eigenvalues would be ± (hbar/2) times the strength of B. So in this problem, perhaps H is written as epsilon sigma · n, where epsilon is including any necessary constants. So if in the problem statement, epsilon is the energy, then the eigenvalues would be ±epsilon.

But wait, let me check the units. The Hamiltonian has units of energy. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless, so their product with epsilon (which is energy) makes H have energy units. So the eigenvalues, being the possible energy measurements, would be ±epsilon.

So looking back at the options, option B is "+epsilon, -epsilon". So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait again. Another approach: find the eigenvalues of H. Since H is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving det(H - E I) = 0.

But H is a scalar (epsilon) multiplied by a unit vector in some direction, dot product with sigma. So H = epsilon (sigma · n). Let's compute sigma · n.

But since n is a unit vector, the magnitude of sigma · n is 1. So H is a traceless matrix with magnitude epsilon. The eigenvalues of such a matrix are plus and minus the magnitude. So eigenvalues are ±epsilon.

So the answer is option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy, and \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The eigenvalues of \( H \) can be determined as follows:

1. The Pauli spin matrices \( \vec{\sigma} \) are traceless and have eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). When combined with a unit vector \( \vec{n} \), the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) represents a spin component in the \( \vec{n} \)-direction. The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), as the magnitude of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is 1 (since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector).

2. Multiplying \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \). This is because the eigenvalues of a scalar multiple of a matrix are the scalar multiplied by the eigenvalues of the matrix.

3. The eigenvalues of \( H \) are therefore \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \), corresponding to the two possible energy outcomes for a spin-1/2 particle in this system.

4. Examining the options:
   - Option A (\( +1, -1 \)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues depend on \( \varepsilon \), not just \( \pm 1 \).
   - Option B (\( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \)) is correct, as derived above.
   - Option C (\( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \)) is incorrect unless \( \varepsilon \) already includes a factor of \( \hbar/2 \), which is not stated in the problem.
   - Option D (\( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \)) is incorrect because it does not involve \( \varepsilon \), which is explicitly part of the Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Answer: B
