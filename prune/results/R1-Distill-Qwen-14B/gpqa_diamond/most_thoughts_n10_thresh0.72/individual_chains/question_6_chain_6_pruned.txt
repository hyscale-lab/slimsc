Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think through it. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that potentials in two dimensions can sometimes be expressed in terms of polar coordinates, which is what's happening here.

Wait, the potential has two terms: one is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential. The other term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So this must be a kind of anisotropic harmonic oscillator because the potential depends on both r and θ, making it direction-dependent.

I think in two dimensions, the potential for an isotropic harmonic oscillator would have a term like (1/2) m ω² r², which is the same in all directions. But here, the second term complicates things because it depends on cos²θ. So maybe the system isn't isotropic anymore. How does that affect the energy levels?

I remember that when dealing with two-dimensional harmonic oscillators, especially in polar coordinates, the problem can sometimes be separated into radial and angular parts, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about this potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates because sometimes it's easier to separate the variables that way.

Wait, let me try to express this potential in terms of x and y coordinates. Since r is the radial distance, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r. Let me substitute that into the potential.

So the first term is (1/2)kr². The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ, which becomes (3/2)kr² (x²/r²) ) = (3/2)k x². Because cos²θ = (x²)/(r²). So putting it together, the potential is (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x².

Hmm, wait, that simplifies to V = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x². Wait, r² is x² +
