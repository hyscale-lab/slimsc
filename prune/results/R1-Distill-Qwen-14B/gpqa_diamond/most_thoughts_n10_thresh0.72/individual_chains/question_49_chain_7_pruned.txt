Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond within a conjugated system, and they're pericyclic reactions. The key here is to figure out what each reaction produces.

Let's start with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under acidic conditions and heat. So the reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine and an allylic alcohol. I'm thinking about the possible mechanisms here. Since it's a sigmatropic rearrangement, maybe it's a Cope or Claisen. Wait, but the starting material isn't a 1,5-diene, so maybe it's another type. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Stork enamine reaction? Oh wait, but that's more about forming rings. 

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on the amine. So the structure is like N(CH2OCH3)2. When it reacts with but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CHCH2OH. But under acidic conditions, the alcohol might lose a proton to form an oxonium ion. Or wait, maybe it's about forming some kind of cyclic intermediate.

Another thought: if we have an amine and an alcohol, maybe they undergo some kind of nucleophilic substitution or a ring-forming reaction. Wait, but the question mentions sigmatropic rearrangements, so perhaps it's a [3,3] sigmatropic shift like Cope or Claisen. But the Claisen usually involves enol ethers. Alternatively, maybe the amine is acting as a base, abstracting a proton somewhere.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CH-OH. No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol structure is CH2CHCH2OH. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH2OH with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2=CHCH2-OH on C2. Maybe it's CH2CH(OH)CH2. Wait, perhaps I should
