Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we have four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. We need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and the energy E is provided as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). 

Hmm, wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so they're fermions, right? That means they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold only one particle, and each state must have a unique set of quantum numbers and spin.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²). Or wait, the problem says E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n = n² E. Oh, right, E is given as that expression, so each energy level is n squared times E. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, and so on.

But since the particles are fermions, we have to fill up the lowest energy states with each possible spin state before moving to the next energy level. Wait, each energy level has two possible spin states, right? Because spin-1/2 can be up or down. So each n level can hold two particles.

So for four particles, how do we fill the states?

Let me think. The ground state is the lowest energy. Each particle fills the lowest available state. But with spin, each n can take two particles.

So for four particles:

We have n=1, which can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold 2 particles. Wait, but wait, four particles, so first fill n=1, then n=2.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Because each energy level (n) can hold two particles (each with opposite spins), the number of particles would be 2 per n. So, for four particles, we can fill n=1 and n=2 each with two particles. So the ground state would have all four particles in n=1 and n=2? No, because n=1 can take 2, and n=2 can take 2. So the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system. Oh wait, no, the question is about the energies of the various states of the system, not the individual particles.

Wait, no, the question says to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited state of the system. So the system's total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but wait, no. The system's energy is the sum of the energies of all particles. So for the ground state configuration, each particle is in the lowest possible states, subject to the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, let me think again. For four fermions, each with spin-1/2, in a 1D box.

Each quantum state is defined by n and spin. So n can be 1,2,3,... and for each n, there are two possible spin states. So the maximum number of particles in each n is 2.

So, for four particles, the ground state will have the first two particles in n=1 (spin up and down), the next two in n=2 (spin up and down). Because each n can take two particles.

So the total energy of the ground state is 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2). Because two particles are at n=1 and two at n=2.

E_1 is (1^2)E = E, E_2 is (2^2)E =4E.

So total energy: 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E =10E.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right
