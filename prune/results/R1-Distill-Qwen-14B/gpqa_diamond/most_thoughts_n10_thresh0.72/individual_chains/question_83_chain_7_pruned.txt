Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that we're starting with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³, right? After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the concentration decreases, which will affect the pH. Let me first figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. So, 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M acetic acid. Oh wait, wait! No, wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Wait, no, wait. Is that right? Because 20 cm³ plus 20 cm³ is 40 cm³. So 0.02 liters each, total 0.04 liters. So yeah, 0.001 moles in 0.04 L. So 0.025 M. Got it.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

At 25% titration, how much NaOH is added? Well, first, let's find the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001 moles. So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. That means 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, the moles of acetic acid that have reacted are 0.00025. So the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so remaining is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025.

Wait, but the total volume of the solution now is the original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So that's 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). Hmm, okay.

So at 25% titration, the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, the concentrations in the buffer. [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 L. Let me calculate that: 0.00025 / 0.0425 is approximately 0.00588 M. [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00588 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. So log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. Rounding to two decimal places, that's about 4.26. So pH at 25% is around 4.26.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me recheck the numbers. Moles of NaOH added at 25% are 0.00025, correct. So moles of HA left: 0.00075, A^- formed: 0.00025. Volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³. So [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.04
