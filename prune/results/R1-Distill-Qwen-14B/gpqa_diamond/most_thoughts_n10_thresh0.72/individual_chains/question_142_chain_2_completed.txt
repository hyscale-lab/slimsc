Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. 

The given density matrix is rho equals (1/2)( |0><0| + |1><1| ). Wait, wait. Let me write that down. So rho = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh, right, each term is a projector into the respective state. So I think this is a mixed state because it's not a pure state. Pure states have a density matrix like |psi><psi|, but this is a sum of projectors for |0> and |1>, each multiplied by 1/2. So this must be a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, I remember that for a single qubit state, the density matrix can be represented in terms of Bloch vector components. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (r_x, r_y, r_z). The maximum length of r is 1 because the density matrix must be positive semi-definite and trace class with trace 1.

So let's see. The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each element. |0> is [1; 0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then rho is (1/2) times the identity matrix, so rho = I/2.

Wait, so rho is (I/2). Comparing this to the general form rho = (I + r·σ)/2, we can set them equal. So I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2, I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides, r·σ = 0. So the vector r must be zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would mean the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because a completely mixed state has no direction in the Bloch sphere—it's maximally uncertain, so it's at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole, corresponding to the pure state |0><0|, I think. Option A is (1,1,0), which doesn't seem right because the vector has magnitude sqrt(1+1) = sqrt(2), which is larger than 1. But wait, the Bloch vector can't have magnitude larger than 1. Oh right, because the state must be trace one and positive, so the vector can't exceed that.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch vector representation of a single-qubit density matrix. The general form of a density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. The given \(\rho\) simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which means it is a completely mixed state. Comparing this to the general form, we find that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), implying that the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is zero. 

Thus, the geometrical position of the state in the Bloch sphere is at the origin, corresponding to \((r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0, 0, 0)\). This matches option C. 

Option A (\((1,1,0)\)) is incorrect because the Bloch vector cannot have a magnitude greater than 1. Option B (\((0,0,1)\)) corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\langle 0|\), and option D (\((1,1,1)\)) is invalid for the same reason as A. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
