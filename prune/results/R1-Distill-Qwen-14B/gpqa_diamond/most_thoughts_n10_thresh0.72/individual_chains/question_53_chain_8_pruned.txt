Okay, so I've got this problem about an organic compound, and I need to figure out its chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's a key piece of information. Ester groups typically have a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum.

Looking at the 1H NMR data, there are six signals. Let me break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern can affect the number of unique aromatic protons. For example, if both substituents are in the para positions, you might see two sets of aromatic protons. Wait, no, para substitution would lead to equivalent protons, so maybe only two signals if the substituents are in such a way that the ring has symmetry. Alternatively, if it's ortho or meta, the number of signals could be different.

Wait, the aromatic signals are two. So maybe the substituents are para, but with something else causing the two signals. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and another is something else, leading to different coupling patterns.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, that suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe a substituent with an adjacent group. For example, if there's an ester group with a vinyl group attached.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So the compound has two different methyl groups. No signals for –CH2 groups, which means there are no methylene groups in the molecule.

Putting this together, the molecule likely has a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is perhaps an alkenyl group with methyl substituents.

Wait, no, the ester itself is a substituent. Let's think about the structure. An ester group would be something like O-C-O, connected to the ring. If the other substituent is a vinyl group, like CH₂CH₂, but that wouldn't explain the –CH3 signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group linked to a methyl group. For example, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like -OOCR), and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like a phenyl group attached to an ester, and another substituent which is a vinyl group. Let me think about possible structures.

Another approach: the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So, perhaps we have two different methyl groups attached to the molecule. For example, an ester might have a methyl group, like in methyl benzoate. But wait, methyl benzoate would have the ester as O-C-O with a methyl group
