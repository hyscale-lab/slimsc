Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that the molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to either propene or cyclopropane. But since the next reaction is bromination in CCl4, I think that's more likely an addition reaction, so probably propene (since cyclopropane would probably undergo substitution, but I'm not too sure). So Compound A is propene, CH2=CH2CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3.

Then, Compound A undergoes bromination in CCl4. I think that's an addition of bromine across the double bond. So propene would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is BrCH2CHBrCH3? Or maybe it's 1,2-dibromopropane. But wait, I think the correct product would be 1,2-dibromopropane because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So when Br2 adds, it adds to the double bond, yielding BrCH2CHBrCH3. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, probably leading to elimination. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, the KOH would likely cause elimination of H and Br. Wait, but
