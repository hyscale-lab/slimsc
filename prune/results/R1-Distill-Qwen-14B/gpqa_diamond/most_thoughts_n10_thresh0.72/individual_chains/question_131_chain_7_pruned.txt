Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions and NMR spectroscopy. Let's break it down.

First, the scenario: a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given. Then, it's reacted with tetramethylcyclopentadiene to yield two products, major and minor. Both have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. The NOESY spectrum has a cross-peak only in the major product.

Wait, NOESY detects through-space interactions between protons. So, if there's a cross-peak, it suggests that the two protons are close in space, perhaps in a ring structure. The minor product lacks this, so maybe the structure is different in terms of ring size or arrangement.

Let me start from the beginning.

The starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration would form an anhydride. Since it's a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. Wait, but wait, when a diacid with a cis-diene is dehydrated, it forms a cyclic anhydride, right? But the structure depends on the position of the acid groups.

The anhydride has a single peak in the 1H NMR at 7 ppm. 7 ppm is upfield for an aromatic proton, but wait, maybe it's an acidic proton, like from an enol or something else. Or perhaps it's an alpha proton to the carbonyl, but those are usually around 2-3 ppm. Hmm, wait, 7 ppm is more like a proton next to an electron-withdrawing group, maybe in an aromatic ring or conjugated system.

Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm peak is from an -OH proton, but in anhydrides, the O-H protons are usually broad or absent if it's a cyclic anhydride. So, perhaps it's a proton in an aromatic ring? Or maybe a vinyl proton adjacent to carbonyl groups.
