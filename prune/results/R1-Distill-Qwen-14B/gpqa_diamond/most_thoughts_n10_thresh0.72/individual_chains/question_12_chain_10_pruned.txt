Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a pion. The reaction given is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. The pion is stationary, and I'm given the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D with different pairs of kinetic energies.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, there are some conservation laws I need to apply. Oh right, conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny (almost zero) mass. But in this case, maybe I can consider the muon and the neutrino as particles in a two-body decay. I think the standard approach here is to use conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me think about how to approach this. I'll probably need to calculate the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, I can treat it as massless. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Oh well, the problem doesn't specify the neutrino's mass, so I guess I can assume it's zero.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So energy is conserved: E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

And for momentum, since the pion was at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other out. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, and the neutrino's as P. So p = -P, but their magnitudes are equal: |p| = |P|.

But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just its momentum multiplied by c, but in units where c=1, E_nu = P * c^2, but wait, I'm a bit confused. No, actually, for a massless particle, the energy is E = |p| * c. But since we're working in MeV and using units where c=1, E_nu = |P|.

Wait, the muon has rest mass, so its energy is given by E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but again, since c=1, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m^2), where m is the rest mass of the muon.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing units. Let me correct that. The energy of
