Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences—like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work and get finite, meaningful results. But not all theories might need this, right?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a different approach, treating particles as strings. Since it's a theory of everything, maybe it's different from standard quantum field theories. I've heard that string theories might not have the same kinds of divergences because they work in higher dimensions or something. So perhaps they don't need regularization as much?

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I know that QED requires renormalization, which is a form of regularization. And since QCD is a non-abelian SU(3) theory, it probably has similar issues. Wait, but QCD actually has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak. That probably makes perturbative methods work better, but does that mean it requires regularization? I think yes because like QED, it's a quantum field theory with loop diagrams that can diverge.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics. Definitely requires regularization. QED is the textbook example where renormalization is used to deal with divergent integrals. You know, like the electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. So regularization is a big part of QED calculations.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, classical theories don't involve quantum effects. So they don't have the same divergences that quantum theories do. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't have issues with renormalization because it's all classical. So classical electrodynamics wouldn't require regularization because it doesn't involve the same infinities as quantum theories.

Wait, but the question is which theory "never" requires regularization. So, the correct answer would be the theory that doesn't deal with these divergences at all.

So, putting it together: QED and QCD need regularization because they are quantum. String theory (superstring) is a quantum theory too, but maybe it's formulated differently. Do string theories require regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think in string theory, some of the divergences are tamed because of the way the theory is structured—like in higher dimensions and with the string's behavior. Also, when you quantize a string theory, maybe the divergences are less severe or absent. Or perhaps they don't require the same kind of ad-hoc renormalization because the theory is background-dependent or something else.

Alternatively, maybe superstring theory does require some form of regularization, but perhaps not the same as in QED or QCD. But the question is about which one never requires it.

Wait, the options are: A) Superstring, B) QCD, C) QED, D) Classical ED.

So,
