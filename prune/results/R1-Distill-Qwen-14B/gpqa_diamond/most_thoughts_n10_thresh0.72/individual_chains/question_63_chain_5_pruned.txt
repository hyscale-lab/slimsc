Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given data includes the masses of atoms X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

Hmm, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition between different energy states. But wait, the question specifies switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that refers to the next higher energy state, probably involving a change in either rotational or vibrational energy.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model... that's a bit tricky. I think that model considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the first excited state. But how does the molecule transition? Does it involve a change in rotation, vibration, or both?

Right, in the rigid rotor-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0). To get to the next state, the molecule can either increase its vibrational state (v=1) or its rotational state (J=1), or maybe some combination. But the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy," which I think implies the smallest energy increment. So the photon should have the energy corresponding to the smallest possible transition. But wait, what's the order of energy levels here?

Vibrational energy levels usually have a much higher spacing than rotational ones. For example, for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy spacing is about (1/2)hw, while the rotational spacing is about (J+1)(something smaller). So the smallest energy transition would probably be a rotational one.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, right, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for bond length variation during rotation, but for this problem, the bond length R is given, so maybe it's treated as a rigid rotor. Hmm.

Wait, but
