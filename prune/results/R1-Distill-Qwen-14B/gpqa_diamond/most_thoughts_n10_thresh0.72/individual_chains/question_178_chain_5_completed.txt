Okay, I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

So the question is about the Lagrangian given by L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and we need to find the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian density should have mass dimension 4 since the integral over spacetime (which has dimension 4) makes the action dimensionless.

First, let's break down the components of the Lagrangian.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F. So let's find the mass dimensions of each of these fields and constants.

Starting with the fermion fields ψ and ψ̄. For a Dirac fermion in four dimensions, each ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because for a spinor in D dimensions, the dimension is (D-1)/2, so in D=4, (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ is the same, 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν}. I think σ is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. The gamma matrices γ_mu are dimensionless because they're just matrices. So the structure σ_{μν} is made of commutators of gammas, so it's dimensionless. So σ has mass dimension 0.

Then F^{μν}. F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I believe. The field strength tensor F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ plus some terms for non-Abelian fields, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume it's Abelian. Anyway, the point is, A_mu is a gauge field, which has mass dimension 1. Each derivative ∂_mu has mass dimension 1. So F^{μν}, which is derivative of A, would have dimension 2, because each derivative is +1 and A is +1. So F is 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ * ψ̄ * σ * ψ * F.

Wait, no, the term is σ_{μν} times F^{μν}, right? So the product σ F is a Lorentz scalar. So each term in the product:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F would be (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5.

So that product has mass dimension 5. The entire term is κ multiplied by this, so the dimension of the Lagrangian term is [κ] +5. Since Lagrangian must have dimension 4, [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=4-5=-1.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. If the coupling has positive mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable. If it's dimensionless (0), it's renormalizable. If it's negative, like here, it's non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait, wait. No, the rule I remember is that couplings with positive mass dimension lead to super-renormalizable theories, because higher loop divergences are tamed. Dimensionless couplings (like in φ^4 theory) are renormalizable. Negative mass dimension couplings mean the theory is non-renormalizable because you need an infinite number of counterterms or the theory is not predictive at higher energies.

So in this case, [κ]=-1. So the coupling has negative mass dimension, which makes the interaction term non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, sometimes there's a confusion. Let me think again. The general rule is that the interaction term in the Lagrangian should have dimension 4. So each term in L_int is dimension 4. Each term is [coupling] × [fields], which must add up to 4.

If the coupling has [κ] = -1, and the fields contribute 5, then -1 +5=4. So yes, that's correct. But for renormalizability, the coupling should have dimension ≤4 minus the sum of the fields' dimensions. Wait, no, the sum of the fields' dimensions is 5, so the coupling must have [κ] =4 -5= -1. So as the coupling has negative dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.

Because for a renormalizable interaction, the coupling should be dimensionless. So [κ] should be 0. So if [κ]=-1, the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it together, κ has dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C: dimension -1, not renormalizable.

Option A: dimension -1, renormalizable. No, because -1 is bad.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} [\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields and constants
- The fermion fields \(\psi\) and \(\bar{\psi}\) each have mass dimension \(\frac{3}{2}\), as fermions in four spacetime dimensions have this property.
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension \(2\), as it is constructed from derivatives of the gauge field \(A_\mu\) (which has mass dimension \(1\)).
- The object \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\) is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so it has mass dimension \(0\).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \(\kappa\)
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension \(4\) in four spacetime dimensions. The term \(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) has the following mass dimensions:
- \(\bar{\psi}\): \(\frac{3}{2}\),
- \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\): \(0\),
- \(\psi\): \(\frac{3}{2}\),
- \(F^{\mu\nu}\): \(2\).

Adding these dimensions gives:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension \(4\), the coupling constant \(\kappa\) must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants are dimensionless (\([g]_M = 0\)) or have positive mass dimension (\([g]_M > 0\), super-renormalizable). If the coupling constants have negative mass dimension (\([g]_M < 0\)), the theory is non-renormalizable. Here, \(\kappa\) has mass dimension \(-1\), so the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable.
