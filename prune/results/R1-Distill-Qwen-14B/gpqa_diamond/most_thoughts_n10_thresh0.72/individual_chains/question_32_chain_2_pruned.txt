Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So, lithium normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals a mass number of 6. So X is Li-6.

I remember that in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they're usually referring to the kinetic energy each ion has. But wait, sometimes they might mean the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. I'll have to figure out which one it is.

The problem gives the speed as 0.96c, so we can probably use the relativistic equations to find the total energy. Once I have the total energy, I can subtract the rest mass energy to get the kinetic energy, or maybe the problem wants the total energy. I need to be careful with that.

First, I should find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass number A is 6, so the mass should be approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But wait, I remember that the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than A*u because of the mass defect from binding energy. However, for this kind of problem, I think we approximate the rest mass as A*u. Or maybe I should look up the precise value?

Wait, the exact rest mass might matter here. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately... I'm not exactly sure, but I know that 1 u is about 1.660539e-27 kg. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I can express everything in terms of energy using the rest mass energy.

The rest mass energy (E_rest) is given by E_rest = m*cÂ². So, if I can find the rest mass m of Li-6, then E_rest will be in joules, but I'll probably need to convert that into GeV at the end.

Alternatively, maybe I should keep everything in natural units where c=1 and use the formula for Lorentz factor gamma.

Right, the speed
