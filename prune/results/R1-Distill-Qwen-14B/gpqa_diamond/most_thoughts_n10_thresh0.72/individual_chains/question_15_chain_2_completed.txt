Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, Planet_1 or Planet_2. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by something like (R_p / a) * (something with the star's radius?), or maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Oh right, the formula is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by the impact parameter, but I think there's a more precise formula.

No, wait, the transit probability P is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by (assuming edge-on orbit), but I'm not exactly sure. Or maybe it's (R_star / a)^2? No, that's the area ratio. For probability, it's more about how likely the orbital plane is aligned so that we see the transit.

I think the probability that a planet transits is P ≈ (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, we can ignore it. So P ≈ R_star / a. But wait, I've heard it's more like the product of the star's radius over the semi-major axis and another factor related to the orbital inclination and eccentricity. But both planets have circular orbits, but I don't know their exact inclinations.

Wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass because it depends on sin(i), where i is the inclination. But for transit probability, the key is the geometric probability, which is (R_star / a) * (something else). Let me think. Oh right, the geometric probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (1 + (a/R_star)^2/2))... No, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Another approach: the probability of a transit is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet. So P ∝ R_star / a. But wait, I need to confirm this.

So for each planet, we can compute this ratio and compare. Let's see the given data:

Planet_1:
- Host star mass is twice that of Planet_2's host star.
- Orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2.
- Both have same mass, but P1 has shorter period.

Wait, Kepler's third law says P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since M is much larger than m (planet mass), we can approximate P² ∝ a³/(M_star). So a^3 = (G M_star P²)/(4π²), so a = [ (G M_star P²)/(4π²) ]^(1/3).

So for Planet_1 and 2, their semi-major axes a1 and a2 can be found as:

a1^3 / a2^3 = (M2 / M1) * (P1² / P2²)

Because M1 = 2 * M2 (since M1 is twice M2). And P1 = (1/3) P2.

So substituting:

a1^3 / a2^3 = (M2 / (2 M2)) ) * ( (P2/3)^2 / P2^2 )

Simplify: (1/2) * (1/9) = 1/18.

So a1^3 = (1/18) a2^3 → a1 = a2 / (18^(1/3)).

What's 18^(1/3)? 18 is 2 * 3^2, so cube root of 18 is about 2.6207.

So a1 ≈ a2 / 2.6207.

But wait, let me compute 18^(1/3) more accurately. 2.6^3 is 17.576, which is close to 18. So cube root of 18 is approximately 2.6207.

So a1 is about 0.381 a2.

Wait, because a1 = a2 / (18^(1/3)) → a1 = a2 * (1/2.6207) ≈ 0.381 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, the transit probability is approximately proportional to R_star / a.

But both stars have the same radius, as per the question. So R_star1 = R_star2.

So P1 = (R_star) / a1.

P2 = (R_star) / a2.

So P1/P2 = (R / a1) / (R / a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 ≈ 0.381 a2 → a2/a1 ≈ 2.62.

So P1 is about 2.62 times higher than P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is about 2.62 times higher.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the formula for the transit probability is more accurately given by (R_star / a) multiplied by ( (R_planet + R_star) / a ), but since R_planet is much smaller, it's just (R_star / a) * (1 + R_planet/R_star) → approx R_star/a.

But I think I might have made a mistake in the comparison. Let's go back.

The transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (a/(R_star + R_planet)) )) → but not exactly. I think the exact formula for the transit probability is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * (1 / (1 + (a/(R_star + R_planet)) )) → but no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe more accurately, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius over the semi-major axis.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me quickly recall the geometric probability formula.

The transit probability is the area of the circle where the planet's orbit would cross the star's disk, divided by the area of the planet's orbit (from the star's perspective). Or more accurately, it's the solid angle of the star as seen from the planet's orbit.

Wait, the formula for the geometric probability is P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)).

But since R_planet << R_star, this is approximately (R_star / a).

Wait, no, I think it's (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_planet / R_star)) but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, that term is negligible. So P ≈ R_star / a.

So for each planet, P is proportional to R_star / a.

In this case, R_star is the same for both (since the stars have the same radius), so P is inversely proportional to a.

Since a1 is smaller than a2, R_star/a1 is larger than R_star/a2, so P1 > P2.

Wait, wait, no. Because a is the semi-major axis. So a1 is much smaller than a2. So R_star/a1 is larger than R_star/a2. So P1 is higher.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2.

But earlier I thought a1 is about 0.38 a2. So P1 = (R/a1) = (R / (0.38 a2)) ≈ (1/0.38) * (R/a2) → 2.63 * P2.

So Planet_1 has a transit probability about 2.63 times higher than Planet_2.

Looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred with ~2.7 times higher probability.

Option C says 1.65 times, which is less than 2.

So the correct answer would be D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the transit probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}} \), we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for the two planets. Given that Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} P_2 \)) and its host star's mass is twice that of Planet_2's host star (\( M_{\text{star,1}} = 2 M_{\text{star,2}} \)), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{\text{star,2}}}{M_{\text{star,1}}} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{18}.
\]

Taking the cube root, we get:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{18}} \approx 0.381.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.381 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability for Planet_1 is higher:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.381} \approx 2.62.
\]

This indicates that Planet_1 has approximately 2.62 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Among the options provided, the closest match is Option D, which states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.

Answer: D
