Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about stars with spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with the Boltzmann equation and maybe some concepts about blackbody radiation or stellar atmospheres.

So the problem says that the star's Teff (effective temperature) is 6000 K when there are no spots. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does the presence of spots lower the effective temperature? Oh right, because dark spots on the star's surface (like sunspots) are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so when a large enough area is covered, it reduces the overall luminosity. But wait, the effective temperature is a measure related to the star's luminosity and radius, so if the spots are cooler, the star's average Teff goes down.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, let me think. The ratio is n1/n2, where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in levels 1 and 2, respectively. The Boltzmann equation relates this ratio
