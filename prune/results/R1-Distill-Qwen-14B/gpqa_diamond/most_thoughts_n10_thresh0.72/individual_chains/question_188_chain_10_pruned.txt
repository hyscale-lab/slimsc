Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal, right? But wait, sometimes people confuse it with a cubic structure, but in a rhombohedral case, the angles can be different from 90 degrees. Oh right, in this question, the angles alpha, beta, and gamma are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think the formula for calculating interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... some terms involving the angles... Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh right, for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but when the crystal system isn't cubic, like in a rhombohedral, the formula changes because of the angles.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is derived using the Miller indices (hkl). For a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of a hexagonal system or something else? Wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of Bravais lattice, I think. Oh right, the rhombohedral crystal system has a lattice with a basis, but all edges are equal and all angles are equal. So the formula for interplanar distance would involve the
