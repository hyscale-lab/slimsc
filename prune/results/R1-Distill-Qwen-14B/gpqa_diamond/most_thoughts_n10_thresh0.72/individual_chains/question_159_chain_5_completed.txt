Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and their observations in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The question provides some specific parameters about the universe based on the Lambda-CDM model, and I need to figure out the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, the question mentions a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. Then it says that the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths below that. Wait, I remember that when we observe objects at high redshifts, there's something called the Lyman-alpha forest or the Gunn-Peterson trough. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the rest frame (far ultraviolet). If that line is redshifted into the optical or near-infrared, that could explain this peak.

So if the quasar's Lyman-alpha line is observed at 790 nm, that must be due to redshift. Let me calculate the redshift z. The formula for redshift is observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z). The rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. So 790 nm equals 121.6 * (1 + z). Let's compute that.

790 = 121.6*(1+z)
Divide both sides by 121.6: 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.498
So 1+z ≈ 6.498 → z ≈ 5.498. So z is about 5.5.

Wait, but wait. If the quasar's Lyman-alpha is at 790, that suggests that the quasar is at a high redshift. But I should check if this makes sense. Let me think: for a quasar at z=5, the Lyman-alpha would be at 121.6*(1+5) = 729.6 nm. At z=5.5, it's 121.6 *6.5= 790.4 nm. So yes, z≈5.5.

Now the question is about the comoving distance to the quasar when the scale factor a=1 (which is now). The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(a H) dt, but I think for a flat universe dominated by matter and dark energy, there's a standard formula.

The comoving distance depends on the Hubble constant, matter density (Ω_m), dark energy (Ω_Λ), and the redshift. The formula is something like D_C = (c/H0) * ∫ (from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). 

Wait, I think E(z) is the expansion factor. So E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ (1+z)^3w, but wait, dark energy has equation of state w≈-1, so (1+z)^3w would be (1+z)^(-3), since w=-1. So, E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ (1+z)^{-3} (1 + 3w) ? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The general form for the Hubble parameter as a function of scale factor a is H(a) = H0 * sqrt(Ω_m a^{-3} + Ω_Λ a^{ -3(1+w)} ). But since a = 1/(1+z), so (1+z) = 1/a. So when a decreases, z increases. So E(z) is sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ (1+z)^{3(1+w)} )}. Wait, but dark energy with w=-1 gives (1+z)^0=1. So E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ) for a flat universe. Because Ω_r is negligible, and curvature is zero (flat universe).

So E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). 

So the integral for comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) * ∫0^z dz' / E(z') 

Given that H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. Let's convert H0 to units of s^{-1} to make the distance in Mpc or Gpc.

Wait, c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc → 70 / (3e5) s^{-1} →  wait, no, H0 is 70 (km/s)/Mpc. So to get H0 in s^{-1}, we need to consider 1 Mpc is about 3.086e19 km. So 1 Mpc = 3.086e19 km. So 70 km/s per Mpc → 70 / (3.086e19 km) s^{-1} → 70/(3.086e19) s^{-1} ≈ 2.268e-18 s^{-1}.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute D_C in terms of H0^{-1}.

Alternatively, remember that the Hubble time is about 1/(H0) → approximately 14 billion years for H0=70. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for comoving distance for a given z. But I don't remember the exact formula off the top of my head, especially for a high z like 5.5.

Wait, for high redshifts, matter dominates initially, but dark energy becomes significant at lower redshifts. At z=5.5, the universe is matter-dominated, because Ω_m (1+z)^3 = 0.3 * (6.5)^3 = 0.3*274.625 = ~82.3875. The dark energy term is 0.7, so E(z) = sqrt(82.3875 + 0.7) → sqrt(83.0875) ≈ 9.115. So E(z) is about 9.115.

Wait, but that's just E(z). So the integral is ∫0^5.5 dz' / E(z'). Hmm, but that integral is complicated because E(z') changes with z'. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate formula for the comoving distance. I remember that for a matter-dominated universe, the comoving distance scales as (2c/H0) * (sqrt(1+z) - 1) / (sqrt(1+z) + 1). Wait, no, I think it's (2c/H0) * (1/ (sqrt(1+z) +1 )) ) * something. Alternatively, maybe I should refer to the standard expressions.

Wait, another approach: use the lookback time formula and then compute the comoving distance based on that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a table or look-up value for comoving distance at high z. I don't remember exact numbers, but I know that for z=1, the comoving distance is around 1.5 Gpc (for H0=70). For z=2, it's around 3 Gpc. For z=5, it's probably around 10 Gpc or more?

Wait, but wait, let me think. The comoving distance is given by D_C = (c/H0) * ∫0^z dz' / E(z').

Given that H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, c is 3e5 km/s. So c/H0 is 3e5 /70 → approximately 4285.7 Mpc. So 4285.7 Mpc is about 4.2857 Gpc.

So D_C = 4.2857 Gpc * ∫0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7) ] dz'

This integral is difficult to compute exactly without numerical methods, but perhaps I can approximate it.

Wait, for z=5.5, since (1+z) is 6.5, and Ω_m (1+z)^3 is 0.3*(6.5)^3 = 0.3*274.625=82.3875, which is much larger than 0.7. So E(z) is dominated by the matter term. So for high z, E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3) ) = sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^{3/2}.

So, E(z) ≈ (1+z)^{3/2} * sqrt(0.3) → so 1/E(z) ≈ 1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^{3/2} )

So the integral becomes ∫ dz' / (sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^{3/2}) ) from 0 to z.

So ∫ dz' (1+z')^{-3/2} = [ -2 (1+z')^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z.

So the integral is [ -2/(sqrt(1+z)) + 2/(sqrt(1+0)) ] → 2 [ 1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

Putting it all together, the integral is approximately (2 / sqrt(0.3)) [ 1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

Wait, but wait:

Wait, I have integral of dz / E(z) ≈ integral dz / [sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^{3/2}] ]

Which is (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫ dz (1+z)^{-3/2}

Let me change variable: let u = 1+z → du=dz. So integral from u=1 to u=1+z.

So ∫ u^{-3/2} du from 1 to 1+z = [ -2 u^{-1/2} ] from 1 to 1+z → -2 (1/(sqrt(1+z)) - 1 )

So the integral = 2 [ 1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

Therefore, the integral is (1/sqrt(0.3)) * 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

Wait, no: the 1/sqrt(0.3) comes from outside the integral.

So ∫ dz' / E(z') ≈ (1/sqrt(0.3)) * 2 [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z)] 

So then, D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (2/sqrt(0.3)) [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

Given that c/H0 is approximately 4.2857 Gpc.

sqrt(0.3) is about 0.5477. So 2/sqrt(0.3) ≈ 2/0.5477 ≈ 3.65.

So D_C ≈ 4.2857 Gpc * 3.65 * [1 - 1/sqrt(1+5.5) ]

Wait, 1+5.5 is 6.5. sqrt(6.5)=~2.5495.

So 1/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 0.392.

So 1 - 0.392 = 0.608.

So D_C ≈ 4.2857 * 3.65 * 0.608.

Let me compute that step by step.

4.2857 * 3.65 ≈ let's see: 4 *3.65=14.6, 0.2857 *3.65≈1.042 → total ≈15.642.

Then multiply by 0.608: 15.642 * 0.608 ≈ let's compute.

15 *0.608=9.12, 0.642*0.608≈0.390, total ≈9.51.

So D_C ≈9.51 Gpc.

Wait, but wait, I made an approximation that E(z) is dominated by the matter term, which is valid at high z. But for z=5.5, the dark energy term is small, but not zero. So perhaps I should consider a better approximation or use exact integration.

But since the options are around 6-9 Gpc, and my approximate calculation gives about 9.5 Gpc, which is near option C (9 Gpc) or D (7 Gpc), but wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the approximation overestimates because at lower z, dark energy starts to contribute, but for z=5.5, the dark energy contribution is negligible. Alternatively, perhaps for a more accurate calculation, I can use a more precise integral.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that for a matter-dominated universe (without dark energy), the comoving distance is D_C = (2 c/H0) (sqrt(1+z) - 1)/(sqrt(1+z) + 1). Let me compute that.

At z=5.5, 1+z=6.5. sqrt(6.5)=~2.5495.

So (sqrt(1+z) -1 ) = 2.5495−1=1.5495.

(sqrt(1+z) +1 )=2.5495+1=3.5495.

So (1.5495)/(3.5495)≈0.4365.

Then D_C = 2 * (c/H0) * 0.4365.

c/H0 is 4.2857 Gpc. So 2 *4.2857 =8.5714 Gpc. Multiply by 0.4365: 8.5714 * 0.4365 ≈ 3.734 Gpc.

Wait, that's way lower than before. Hmm, but wait, that's for a universe with only matter (Ω_m=1, Ω_Λ=0), but our universe is flat with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7. So in reality, dark energy starts to affect the expansion at lower redshifts, but at z=5.5, it's negligible. So I think the initial approximation D_C ~9.5 Gpc is probably too high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Because in the matter-dominated universe, the comoving distance is indeed larger than in a dark energy-dominated universe. Wait no, dark energy accelerates expansion, which would cause the comoving distance to be larger for the same redshift compared to a matter-only universe? Or the opposite?

Wait, in a matter-dominated universe, the expansion rate is slower. So higher z would have larger comoving distances compared to a dark energy case? Hmm, not sure. Let me think about it.

Wait, for a given z, if dark energy is significant, the universe expands faster, so the lookback time is shorter. Wait, but comoving distance depends on the expansion history. Hmm, it's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I can refer to some standard values.

From what I recall, at z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.5 Gpc for H0=70.

At z=2, about 3 Gpc.

At z=5, comoving distance is about 10 Gpc.

Wait, but that's in a matter-dominated universe. But in our case, with dark energy, the expansion is faster, so the comoving distance might be a bit larger than the matter-only case.

But wait, in the current universe, dark energy becomes dominant at z ~0.5 or so. So for z=5.5, the universe is matter-dominated, and dark energy's contribution is small, so the comoving distance should be similar to the matter-dominated case.

Wait, but the matter-dominated case gives at z=5.5, comoving distance ~9.5 Gpc? Or is it different.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for comoving distance in a flat universe.

The comoving distance is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ)] dz'

Given that H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, c=3e5 km/s, so c/H0 = 3e5 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc = 4.2857 Gpc.

So D_C = 4.2857 Gpc * ∫0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)} ] dz'

This integral can be approximated numerically.

Let me try to approximate the integral.

Let me compute the integrand at a few points.

At z=0: denominator is sqrt(0.3*(1)^3 +0.7 )= sqrt(0.3+0.7)=1 → integrand=1.

At z=1: 0.3*(2)^3=2.4 → sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=~1.761 → integrand ≈0.567.

At z=2: 0.3*(3)^3=8.1 → sqrt(8.1+0.7)=sqrt(8.8)=2.966 → integrand≈0.337.

At z=3: 0.3*(4)^3=19.2 → sqrt(19.2 +0.7)=sqrt(19.9)=4.461 → integrand≈0.224.

At z=4: 0.3*(5)^3=37.5 → sqrt(37.5+0.7)=sqrt(38.2)=6.18→ integrand≈0.1617.

At z=5: 0.3*(6)^3=108 → sqrt(108 +0.7)=sqrt(108.7)=10.426 → integrand≈0.096.

At z=5.5: 0.3*(6.5)^3=0.3*274.625=82.3875 → sqrt(82.3875 +0.7)=sqrt(83.0875)=9.115 → integrand≈0.1097.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, sqrt(83.0875) is about 9.115. So 1/9.115 ≈0.1097.

Wait, but wait, earlier at z=5, the integrand was ~0.096, and at z=5.5 it's higher. That seems counterintuitive because as z increases, (1+z) increases, so the denominator increases, so the integrand decreases. So why is it higher at z=5.5 than at z=5? Oh wait, no, wait, that's not correct. Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, at z=5, (1+z)=6, so 0.3*(6)^3=0.3*216=64.8. 64.8 +0.7=65.5. sqrt(65.5)=~8.093. So 1/8.093≈0.1235.

Wait, earlier I miscalculated.

Let me correct that.

At z=5: 0.3*(6)^3=0.3*216=64.8. So denominator sqrt(64.8 +0.7)=sqrt(65.5)=~8.093. So integrand=1/8.093 ≈0.1235.

At z=5.5: (1+z)=6.5 → 0.3*(6.5)^3 =0.3*274.625=82.3875. 82.3875 +0.7=83.0875. sqrt(83.0875)=9.115. So integrand=1/9.115≈0.1097.

So the integrand is actually decreasing as z increases from 0 to 5.5. So perhaps the integral can be approximated by averaging the integrand multiplied by the step in z. Let's split the integral into intervals.

But this could get tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can use Simpson's rule for numerical integration.

But for the sake of time, perhaps I can approximate the integral by taking the average of the integrand at several points.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the midpoint values and sum them up with step sizes.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the midpoint rule. Let's split the interval from 0 to 5.5 into, say, 5 steps.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the approximated formula for high redshifts.

Wait, at high z, the universe is matter-dominated, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^{3/2}.

So the integrand becomes 1 / [sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^{3/2} ]

So the integral becomes:

∫ dz' / [sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^{3/2} ] from 0 to z.

Which can be evaluated as (1/sqrt(0.3)) * [ 2/(1 + z')^{1/2} ] from 0 to z.

So the integral is (2/sqrt(0.3)) [ 1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

So, substituting z=5.5,

Integral = (2 / 0.5477) [1 - 1/sqrt(6.5) ]

sqrt(6.5)=2.5495, so 1/sqrt(6.5)≈0.392.

So 1 -0.392=0.608.

(2 / 0.5477)≈3.65.

So the integral is 3.65 * 0.608 ≈2.214.

So D_C = 4.2857 Gpc * 2.214 ≈9.48 Gpc.

Hmm, that's approximately 9.5 Gpc, which is option C (9 Gpc) or close to D (7 Gpc)—but wait, 9.5 is closest to 9 Gpc (option C).

But wait, this assumes that E(z) is entirely due to matter. But in reality, for z=5.5, dark energy contributes a little. So perhaps the actual integral is slightly less than 9.5 Gpc because dark energy makes E(z) slightly larger, thus the integrand slightly smaller, making the integral a bit smaller.

So the exact value would be a bit less than 9.5, perhaps around 8-9 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option C is 9 Gpc, D is 7, B is 8, and A is 6.

So the closest would be 9 Gpc, but perhaps 8 is more accurate.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise approach.

Another approach: the comoving distance for a flat universe with matter and dark energy can be computed using the function:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + ΩΛ)} ] dz'

But without numerical integration, it's hard to get an exact value. So perhaps I can use an online calculator or look up a table.

Wait, but since I can't do that, perhaps I can find an approximation or a rule of thumb.

I found a reference that for z=5, the comoving distance is about 10 Gpc, but that's for a matter-only universe. Since our universe has dark energy, the comoving distance would be a bit longer than in a matter-only universe because dark energy accelerates expansion, making the universe expand faster, which would decrease the comoving distance? Or increase it?

Wait, no, dark energy accelerates expansion, which would cause the expansion to speed up, making the universe expand more in the past, so for a given redshift, the comoving distance is larger.

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me think: if the universe expands faster, then for a given redshift, the light has to travel a shorter time to reach us, but the comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/H(a), which is longer if H(a) is smaller. So if dark energy makes H(a) larger (because expansion is faster), then 1/H(a) is smaller, so the integral would be smaller. So the comoving distance would be smaller than in a matter-only universe at high redshifts.

Wait, that's correct. Because in dark energy models, the expansion is faster, which means that for a given redshift, the comoving distance is shorter than in a matter-only universe.

So if in a matter-only universe, at z=5.5, D_C ≈9.5 Gpc, then in our universe, which includes dark energy, D_C would be less than that.

So perhaps around 8 Gpc.

Looking at the options, B is 8 Gpc.

Wait, but earlier approximation gave 9.5, but that's without considering dark energy. So perhaps the correct answer is around 8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a cosmology calculator. Because I'm trying to think, but perhaps I can recall that for z=5, D_C is about 10 Gpc in matter-only, but in our universe, it's about 8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps for z=5.5, it's approximately 8 Gpc.

So the options are 6,7,8,9.

So I think the correct answer is probably 8 Gpc, which is option B.


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth, we analyze the observations and cosmological parameters provided. The quasar's Lyman-alpha emission line, originally at 121.6 nm in the rest frame, is observed at 790 nm, indicating a redshift \( z \). Using the redshift formula:

\[
\text{Observed wavelength} = \text{Rest wavelength} \times (1 + z),
\]

we calculate:

\[
z = \frac{\text{Observed wavelength}}{\text{Rest wavelength}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 5.5.
\]

With a redshift \( z \approx 5.5 \), the comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}},
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light, \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), and \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \). The term \( \frac{c}{H_0} \) is approximately \( 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc} \).

At high redshifts (\( z \gg 1 \)), the universe is matter-dominated, and the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \approx \frac{2}{\sqrt{\Omega_m}} \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z}} \right].
\]

Substituting \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \) and \( z = 5.5 \):

\[
\sqrt{1+z} = \sqrt{6.5} \approx 2.55, \quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z}} \approx 0.392,
\]

\[
\int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}} \approx \frac{2}{\sqrt{0.3}} \left[ 1 - 0.392 \right] = \frac{2}{0.5477} \times 0.608 \approx 2.214.
\]

Thus, the comoving distance is:

\[
D_C \approx 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc} \times 2.214 \approx 9.5 \, \text{Gpc}.
\]

However, the presence of dark energy slightly modifies the expansion history, reducing the comoving distance compared to a matter-only universe. For \( z = 5.5 \), the comoving distance is approximately \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \), which aligns with the provided cosmological parameters.

From the options, the closest value is:

**A) 6 Gpc**  
**B) 8 Gpc**  
**C) 9 Gpc**  
**D) 7 Gpc**

The best match is **B) 8 Gpc**.

Answer: B
