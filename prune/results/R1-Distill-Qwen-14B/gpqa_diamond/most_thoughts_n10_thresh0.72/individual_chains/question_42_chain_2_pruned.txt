Okay, let's try to figure this out. So we've got three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not too sure about that, but I guess it's not super relevant for the calculations here.

The problem gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between the planets. For Planet1 and Planet2, the ratio is about 1.4. So if Planet1's temperature is T1, then Planet2's T2 is 1.4 * T1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T2 / T1 = 1.4? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I need to get that straight. Because the wording says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." Hmm, maybe it's T2 over T1 equals 1.4, meaning Planet2 is hotter than Planet1 by a factor of 1.4.

Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is about 2.3. So T3 / T2 is 2.3? Or T2 / T3? Wait, the wording says "between Planet2 and Planet3" so I think it's T3 over T2 is 2.3, so Planet3 is hotter than Planet2 by 2.3 times? Or wait, maybe the ratio is T2 over T3. Because if Planet3 is further out, it would be colder, right? Because temperature usually decreases with distance from the star. So maybe I got it backwards.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L_star/(16πσ)) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - albedo) / ( (1 + e) * sqrt(1-e²) ) )^(1/4) ) * (d)^(-1/2), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So it simplifies to T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) / sqrt(d) ). Assuming albedo is the same for all (given as 0.3), then the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance.

So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). So if Planet2 is hotter than Planet1 by 1.4, that would mean Planet2 is closer to the star. Because higher T implies smaller d.

Wait, let me think again. T is proportional to (L / (16πσ d²))^(1/4), so T is proportional to 1/(d^(1/2)). So if T2 is higher than T1, then d2 < d1.

So for Planet1 and Planet2: T2 / T1 = 1.4. So T is higher for Planet2, which is closer.

Similarly, T3 / T2 = 2.3. So Planet3 is hotter than Planet2? That would mean Planet3 is closer than Planet2, but that's contradictory because Planet3 would be the hottest. But that can't be, since if they're
