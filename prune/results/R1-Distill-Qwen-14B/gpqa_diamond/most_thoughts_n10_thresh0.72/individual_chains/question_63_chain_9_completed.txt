Okay, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state and what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next lowest state. The molecule is diatomic, made of atoms X and Y with given masses. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is given as 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the fundamental state... I think that refers to the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state, both rotationally and vibrationally. When a photon is absorbed, it should transition to the next higher energy state. But the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that means considering both vibrational and rotational transitions. Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, each state is a combination of vibrational and rotational levels. The next state would be the one with the next higher energy, which could involve either a change in vibrational state or a change in rotational state.

Wait, no, the question is about switching to the next state (the lowest possible energy), which I think implies the smallest possible energy increase. That would mean the transition with the least energy difference. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll think more.

The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either increase the vibrational state or the rotational state. But I remember that in the rigid rotor model (which might be the same as the rotation-vibration model here), the energy levels are quantized. For rotation, the energy is E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, it's E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where h is Planck's constant.

So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible states would be either v=1 (so increasing vibration) or J=1 (increasing rotation). Which transition has a lower energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

Wait, for vibration, the energy difference from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = (1 + ½) h w - (0 + ½) h w ) = h w. For rotation, the energy from J=0 to J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B*(1+1) - B*(0+1)*0 = 2B - 0 = 2B. So the energy difference for rotation is 2B.

Which of the two (ΔE_vib or ΔE_rot) is smaller? That depends on the value of B compared to h w. I need to calculate B.

The rotational constant B is given by B = (h^2)/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ r², and μ is the reduced mass.

So first, let's compute the reduced mass μ.

Mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So Mx = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg. My = 2 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27) 

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator. Numerator: 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53. 3.32 squared is about 11. So 11e-53 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ ≈ (11e-53) / (3.652e-26) ) = (11 / 3.652) * 1e-27 ≈ 3.01 * 1e-27 kg.

μ ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

Now, bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, B = h²/(8 π² I ). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² is approximately 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator: 78.9568 * I = 78.9568 * 1.204e-46 ≈ 95.05e-46.

So B ≈ (4.39e-67) / (95.05e-46) ) 

Wait, 95.05e-46 is 9.505e-45.

So 4.39e-67 / 9.505e-45 = (4.39 /9.505) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.4618 * 1e-22 = 4.618e-23 J.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check the exponents.

Wait, 4.39e-67 divided by 9.505e-45 is (4.39 /9.505) * 1e-67+45 = (approx 0.4618) * 1e-22 = 4.618e-23 J.

But wait, J (joules) is kg m²/s². So okay.

Now, the energy difference for the rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) is 2B. So 2 * 4.618e-23 = 8.236e-23 J.

The energy difference for the vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) is h w. Given w is 4e14 rad/s. So h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Comparing the two: 8.2e-23 J (rotational) vs 2.65e-19 J (vibrational). The rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon needs to supply 8.236e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. That would be the next lowest energy state, which would be the one requiring the least energy. So between the two options, the rotational transition requires less energy, so that's the one the photon would cause.

So the photon's energy must be equal to the rotational transition energy, which is 8.236e-23 J.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. So E_photon = pc. So p = E/c.

Wait, photon momentum p is given by p = E/c. Because for photons, E = pc.

So calculating p: E = 8.236e-23 J.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (8.236e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (8.236 / 3) * 1e-31 kg m/s. 8.236/3 is approximately 2.745. So p≈2.745e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but I need to check the units. The options are in N*s. Oh, 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s, so the units are compatible.

Wait, 1 Ns = kg m/s, so 2.745e-31 kg m/s is the same as 2.745e-31 Ns.

But looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28 Ns → 1.9e-28 is larger than 2.7e-31.

Hmm, none of the options seem to match this. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, let's recheck the B calculation. Let's go through it again.

B = h²/(8 π² I)

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I is 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

So denominator: 8 π² I = 8 * (π)^2 * 1.204e-46.

π^2 is about 9.8696. So 8 *9.8696 = about 78.9568.

So 78.9568 *1.204e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 *1.204 = approximately 95.15.

So denominator is 95.15e-46 = 9.515e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.515e-45 = (4.39 /9.515) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.461 *1e-22 = 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, that's correct. So 2B would be 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, no, 2B is 2 *4.61e-23 = 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, wait, no: the energy transition for rotation is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B. So yes, 2B.

Wait, that's 9.22e-23 J.

But when I calculated E_photon, I assumed it's 8.236e-23 J. Wait, no, I think I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, no: 4.61e-23 J is B. So 2B is 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, that's the energy difference for the rotational transition.

The vibrational transition is h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 ≈ 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger.

So if the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J, then p = E/c = 9.22e-23 /3e8 = approx 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

Looking at the options, none of the options are close to this. The options are around 1e-27 or 1e-28 Ns.

Hmm, so perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is treated as a non-rigid rotor, but for the purpose of this question, maybe it's a rigid rotor. Oh, but the question says "non-rigid rotor model", which I'm not as familiar with. Wait, no, the quantum rotation-vibration model is typically the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximation. Maybe the non-rigid rotor is more complex, but perhaps for this problem, we can proceed with the rigid rotor model.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the rotation, but the vibration. Because the photon's momentum is to be calculated, and the options are in a much higher order. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is a combination of vibration and rotation, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the transition where the molecule goes from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. So that's a vibrational transition without a change in rotational state. Then, the energy difference would be h w, and the photon's energy would be h w.

So let's compute that. h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is smaller. Option A is 1.9e-28. Option C is 1.1e-27.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is between options A and D.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match. So maybe I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition, but I might have made an error in calculating B.

Wait, let me re-calculate B.

B = h²/(8 pi² I )

I = mu r².

mu = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) ) = (40/22) amu = (20/11) ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in calculating mu. Let me re-do that.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) =40 /22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so mu =1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg.

Let's compute that: 1.818 *1.66e-27 = approx 3.01e-27 kg. Wait, same as before. So earlier mu calculation was correct.

Wait, but I'm redoing the calculation because I thought I made a mistake earlier.

So I is mu * r². r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

r² is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.01e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg m².

So B = h²/(8 pi² I )

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 pi² I =8 * (pi)^2 * 1.204e-46.

8 pi² is approx 78.9568.

78.9568 *1.204e-46 = 78.9568 *1.204 is about 95.05, so 95.05e-46 =9.505e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.505e-45 = (4.39 /9.505) * 1e-22.

4.39/9.505 is approximately 0.4618. So B is 4.618e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.236e-23 J.

But wait, the energy for the rotational transition is 2B, which is 9.236e-23 J.

So the photon's energy would be 9.236e-23 J, and its momentum p = E/c = 9.236e-23 /3e8 = 3.078e-31 kg m/s → 3.078e-31 Ns.

Looking at the options, none of them are close. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait another approach: perhaps the transition is in the vibrational mode, but with a change in the rotational state as well. But that seems more complicated, and the question asks for the next lowest possible energy state, which would be the one requiring the least energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state with J=0 to the same vibrational state but J=1. That would be a pure rotational transition, which requires 2B.

But then, the same problem arises: the momentum is way too low compared to the options.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong and the non-rigid rotor model is being considered. In the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia. But I'm not sure how to model that for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition where the molecule goes from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next higher state, which would be v=1, J=0. That would be a vibrational transition, energy h w. So p = h w / c.

Wait, h w is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = (2.65e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s → which is 8.83e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition, but under the non-rigid model, which would have a different frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total energy, which includes both vibrational and rotational, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is being modeled as a rigid rotor for rotation and a harmonic oscillator for vibration. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be a combination of vibration and rotation, but the "lowest possible energy" would be the one with the smallest energy increase. So whether it's a vibrational transition (h w) or a rotational transition (2B), which one is smaller.

So comparing h w and 2B.

h w is 2.65e-19 J.

2B is 9.236e-23 J.

Clearly, 2B is much smaller. So the photon energy should match 2B, leading to p=3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are anywhere near that.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in B. Let me recalculate B.

Wait, B is (h^2) / (8 pi^2 I )

Let me recompute h^2: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Wait, 6.626e-34 squared is (6.626)^2 = about 43.9, so 43.9e-68 → 4.39e-67. Correct.

I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

So denominator: 8 pi² I = 78.9568 *1.204e-46 = 95.05e-46 =9.505e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 /9.505e-45 → 4.39e-67 / 9.505e-45 = (4.39 /9.505) * 1e-22 = 0.4618e-22 → 4.618e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.236e-23 J.

Wait, but if the photon's energy is 9.236e-23 J, then p = 9.236e-23 /3e8 = 3.078e-31 kg m/s = 3.078e-31 Ns.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the quantum model, but the classical model. Or perhaps the model is considering only rotational transitions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational energy only. Let's think: the fundamental state is the ground state (v=0), and the next state is the first vibrational excited state (v=1). So the energy difference is h w. Then, the photon's momentum is h w /c, which we calculated as 8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should consider the energy in terms of wavenumbers, but that doesn't seem to change the result.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1, leading to 2B. So the photon's energy is 2B, and the momentum is 2B/c.

Wait, 2B is 9.236e-23 J. So p=9.236e-23 /3e8 = 3.078e-31 Ns.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me try to compute B more accurately.

Let me compute each step precisely.

Compute mu:

mu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) ) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1.81818 amu * 1.660539e-27 kg/amu = let's compute that.

1.81818 *1.660539e-27 = (approx) 1.81818 *1.660539 = about 3.018e-27 kg.

r=2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = mu * r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

h=6.62607015e-34 J s.

So B = h²/(8 pi² I )

h squared: (6.62607015e-34)^2 = (6.62607015)^2 *1e-68. 6.626^2 = approx 43.9; so 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 pi^2 I =8*(pi^2)*1.2072e-46.

pi^2 is about 9.8696.

8 *9.8696 =78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2072e-46 = 78.9568 *1.2072 = let's compute that:

1.2072 *70 =84.504, 1.2072 *8.9568= approx 10.823. So total approx 95.327.

So denominator is 95.327e-46 =9.5327e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.5327e-45 = (4.39 /9.5327) * 1e-22.

4.39 /9.5327 ≈0.4606.

So B=0.4606e-22 J=4.606e-23 J.

So 2B=9.212e-23 J.

p = 9.212e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, the problem states that the model is the 'non-rigid rotor model'. Oh! So in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, which affects the moment of inertia. But I'm not sure how that would be incorporated here. Perhaps when the molecule absorbs a photon, the bond length changes, and thus the moment of inertia changes, leading to a different energy transition. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the energy transition but about the momentum given to the molecule when it absorbs a photon. The photon's momentum is given, and that would translate into the molecule's change in momentum. But that's a different approach.

Wait, in the center-of-mass frame, the molecule's momentum would change by p (photon's momentum), but the question is about the photon's momentum needed to cause a transition. But perhaps that's not relevant here.

Alternative approach: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which is the next possible state with the next lowest energy. That could be either a vibrational transition (v=1, J=0) or a rotational transition (v=0, J=1). Whichever requires the least energy would be the one the photon provides.

So, let's compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

ΔE_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

ΔE_rot =2B=9.21e-23 J.

Comparing the two, 9.21e-23 is much smaller than 2.65e-19. So the photon should have energy corresponding to 9.21e-23 J.

p = E_photon /c =9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 → 1.9e-28 Ns.

B) 2.3e-27 → 2.3e-27 Ns.

C) 1.1e-27 →1.1e-27 Ns.

D)1.4e-28 → 1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, none match. So perhaps the mistake is in the assumption. Maybe the transition considered is a vibrational transition with a change in rotational state as well. But that would be a combination of both, which complicates things, and the energy would be higher than just the vibrational or rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational transition, but perhaps the given w is the vibrational frequency, and the photon's momentum is based on that.

As earlier, p = h w /c.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have that either. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is the lowest possible. Maybe the next state is the first rotational state (J=1), but that requires 2B. So when the photon is absorbed, the molecule's rotational state changes. So the photon's energy is 2B, giving p=3.07e-31 Ns.

But that's way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the photon's momentum, but considering that the molecule is a diatomic with a certain rest mass. The photon's momentum would cause the molecule to recoil, but perhaps the question is only about the photon's momentum, not the molecule's recoil. So I think the earlier approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the wrong value for B.

Wait, another way: perhaps the model is considering the molecule as a quantum harmonic oscillator, so the energy levels are E_vib = (v + ½) h w. So the first transition is v=0→v=1, ΔE= h w.

In that case, photon energy is 2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 Ns.

But options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the reduced mass correctly.

Wait, let me double-check mu:

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Which is 1.818 *1.66e-27 kg ≈3.018e-27 kg. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, but I used meters correctly.

Wait, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters, so correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and the photon causes it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

So the next possible energy states are either a vibrational transition (v=1) or a rotational transition (J=1). The one with the lower ΔE is the rotational transition. So the photon's energy is 2B =9.236e-23 J.

p = E/c =9.236e-23 /3e8 =3.078e-31 kg m/s =3.078e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the question considers the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=2), but that would require 4B, which is even larger, so not the next lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational state J=1, which requires 2B, but using a different approach.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is about the energy of the photon in terms of the photon's momentum. But no, the relation is E=pc for photons.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the vibrational energy, but I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0). So the energy change is just h w, as calculated.

In that case, p=8.83e-28 Ns. But the options are:

A)1.9e-28 → ~8.83e-28 is about 4.6 times option A.

B)2.3e-27 → much larger.

C)1.1e-27 → about 12.5 times larger.

D)1.4e-28 → about 6.3 times smaller.

So none match.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the photon's energy as the sum of both the vibrational and rotational transitions. But that would be a higher energy, so not the lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions from the ground state to a higher state, not necessarily the next state. Wait, no, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute it once more precisely.

B = h²/(8 pi² I )

h =6.626e-34 J s.

h squared = (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 =43.9 →43.9e-68 =4.39e-67 J² s².

I = mu * r² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.018e-27 *4e-20=1.207e-46 kg m².

Denominator 8 pi² I =8 * (pi^2) *1.207e-46.

pi^2=9.8696.

8 *9.8696=78.9568.

78.9568 *1.207e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 *1.207 = approximately 95.34.

So denominator is 95.34e-46 →9.534e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.534e-45 = (4.39 /9.534) *1e-22 → approximately 0.4606e-22 →4.606e-23 J.

So 2B=9.212e-23 J.

p=9.212e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, perhaps the closest is option D (1.4e-28), but that's way off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state which is the first rotational state (J=1, v=0). So that's a pure rotational transition, which requires 2B.

But then, the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), which is the same as the rotational transition we've been discussing.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the angular momentum. Because in rotation, the angular momentum quantum number J increases, and the change in angular momentum is related to the photon's angular momentum. But photons have angular momentum, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula. For example, in the rigid rotor model, ΔE for rotation is 2B when J increases by 1. So the photon's energy must be 2B.

But again, the calculated momentum is way too small.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the reduced mass. Let me recheck.

mu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) → (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) )=40/(22)=20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.66e-27 kg →1.818 *1.66e-27 →3.018e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is in a different unit. Wait, the problem states R is 2 angstroms. So 2e-10 m, correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option A: 1.9e-28 Ns. But how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the vibrational energy, but the photon's momentum is calculated in a different way.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28).

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me compute h w again.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J. Correct.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition, but I'm not seeing why the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where p is 3.07e-28 Ns. But option D is 1.4e-28, which is about half.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B with more precise values.

Compute mu:

mu = (20 *2) / (20+2) =40/22 =1.8181818 amu.

1.8181818 *1.660539e-27 kg/amu = let me compute this exactly.

1.8181818 *1.660539e-27 = (1.8181818 *1.660539 ) *1e-27.

1.8181818 *1.660539 ≈3.01828e0.

So mu=3.01828e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I= mu * r²=3.01828e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 =3.01828e-27 *4e-20 =1.20731e-46 kg m².

Now, compute B= h²/(8 pi² I )

h=6.62607015e-34 J s.

h squared = (6.62607015e-34)^2 = (6.62607015)^2 *1e-68.

6.62607015^2 = approximately 43.903.

So h squared =43.903e-68 =4.3903e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 pi² I=8*(pi^2)*1.20731e-46.

pi^2=9.8696.

8 *9.8696=78.9568.

78.9568 *1.20731e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 *1.20731.

78.9568 *1.20731 ≈ let's compute:

1.20731 *70=84.5117

1.20731 *8.9568≈10.815.

Total approx 84.5117 +10.815=95.3267.

So denominator is 95.3267e-46 =9.53267e-45.

So B=4.3903e-67 /9.53267e-45 = (4.3903 /9.53267) *1e-22.

4.3903 /9.53267 ≈0.4606.

So B=4.606e-23 J.

2B=9.212e-23 J.

p=9.212e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the transition from the ground state, but from the next state. No, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering the wrong model. If the model is the non-rigid rotor, perhaps the bond length isn't fixed, so I is a function of v. But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first excited rotational state (J=1), with vibrational state remaining the same. So the energy change is 2B.

So, the photon's energy is 2B=9.212e-23 J.

p=9.212e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but I must choose from the options given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the units of the angular frequency. Oh! Wait, angular frequency is given in rad/s, which is correct for the harmonic oscillator model. So I think that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option A: 1.9e-28 Ns. But I don't see how to get that from the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Wait, no, I think I did that correctly.

Another thought: perhaps I should compute the rotational partition function or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's momentum is related to the change in angular momentum. But photons carry angular momentum related to their polarization, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the momentum is determined by the change in the molecule's linear momentum due to the photon's impact. But that's a different approach, more like the photoelectric effect. But I'm not sure.

In that case, the change in the molecule's linear momentum would be 2p, where p is the photon's momentum. But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is miswritten, and the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from v=0 to v=1, but with a change in rotational state as well. So the total energy change would be h w + 2B. But that's a higher energy than either transition alone, so it's not the next state with the lowest energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition, but I've made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B more precisely. Let me try the exact calculation.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818181818 amu.

1 amu =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

mu = (20 * 2)/(20 +2) *1.66053906660e-27 kg = (40/22) *1.66053906660e-27.

40/22 =1.818181818.

So mu =1.818181818 *1.66053906660e-27 ≈3.0182818e-27 kg.

r=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

I=mu*r²=3.0182818e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.0182818e-27 *4e-20 =1.2073127e-46 kg m².

h=6.62607015e-34 J s.

h squared = (6.62607015e-34)^2 =4.39030225e-67 J² s².

Denominator:8 pi² I=8 * (pi^2) *1.2073127e-46.

pi^2=9.8696044.

8 *9.8696044=78.956835.

78.956835 *1.2073127e-46 =95.326815e-46=9.5326815e-45.

So B =4.39030225e-67 /9.5326815e-45 =4.39030225 /9.5326815 *1e-22.

4.39030225 /9.5326815≈0.4606.

So B=4.606e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 2B=9.212e-23 J.

p=9.212e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

But again, options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be based on the vibrational transition, but using a different formula. Let me think about the vibrational energy.

The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + ½) h w.

So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w.

So E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match that either.

Hmm. I'm running out of ideas. Perhaps the correct answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns, but I can't see how to get that from the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in using w as the vibrational frequency. Wait, sometimes in these models, the vibrational frequency is used in terms of cm^-1, but that's a different approach. But no, the question gives w in rad/s.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum not for the entire energy transition but for a different reason, but I can't think of what that would be.

Wait, perhaps the question is in error, but assuming that the correct approach is to calculate the rotational transition, the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. But since the options are all higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: the moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ r². Perhaps I should use the bond length in meters correctly. Wait, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m, which I did correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the reduced mass and the moment of inertia again.

mu = (20 *2) / (20 +2) =40/22=20/11=1.8181818 amu.

1 amu=1.660539e-27 kg.

mu=1.8181818 *1.660539e-27 kg.

1.8181818 *1.660539e-27 = let's compute:

1.8181818 *1.660539 = let's compute 1.8181818 *1.660539:

1.8181818 *1=1.8181818

1.8181818 *0.660539 ≈1.8181818 *0.6=1.090909, 1.8181818 *0.060539≈0.11006. So total ≈1.8181818 +1.090909 +0.11006≈2.51915.

So mu≈2.51915e-27 kg? Wait, no. Wait wait, 1.8181818 *1.660539e-27.

Wait, wait, 1.8181818 *1.660539 = approximately 3.0182818.

So mu=3.0182818e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

r=2e-10 m.

I=3.0182818e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.0182818e-27 *4e-20=1.2073127e-46 kg m².

Now, B= h²/(8 pi² I )

h=6.62607015e-34 J s.

h squared=4.3903e-67 J² s².

Denominator:8 pi² I=8*(9.8696044)*1.2073127e-46=78.956835 *1.2073127e-46=95.326815e-46=9.5326815e-45.

B=4.3903e-67 /9.5326815e-45=4.3903 /9.5326815 *1e-22=0.4606e-22=4.606e-23 J.

So 2B=9.212e-23 J.

p=9.212e-23 / (3e8)=3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total energy transition including both vibrational and rotational changes, but that would require higher energy, not the lowest.

Hmm.

After all these calculations and not finding a match, I'm inclined to think that perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but based on the options, perhaps the intended approach was to consider the vibrational transition, leading to p=8.83e-28 Ns, which is closest to option A (1.9e-28), but that's about four times smaller than our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the intention was to use a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions. But that would be higher, not lower.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon causing a transition to the first excited state, which is a combination of the lowest vibrational and rotational changes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1), which would involve both changes, but that's more energy than needed.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and not finding a matching option, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't find where.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy as E_rot = B J (J+1), and the transition is from J=0 to J=1, which requires 2B. So the photon's energy is 2B.

But 2B is 9.212e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 Ns. No option matches.

I'm at a loss. Maybe I should look for an error elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the mass of the atoms is given in amu, but I should have used kilograms directly without converting to kg. But no, that's essential to get the correct moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the wrong formula. For instance, perhaps the energy for rotation is considered as E_rot = (h c B) J (J+1), but I don't think that's the case.

Another approach: perhaps the question is about the total energy including both rotational and vibrational, but I'm not sure.

Wait, given the options, perhaps the intended approach is to compute the photon's momentum based on the vibrational transition, and perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute the photon's momentum again for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But none of the options are close to this.

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency given is in cm^-1, not rad/s? That would change the calculation.

But the question says w is 4e14 rad/s. So that can't be the case.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I've considered all the possibilities, and the correct answer isn't matching any of the options. But since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is option A, assuming I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition in the rotational model with the bond length not being fixed, but I don't know how to proceed.

After all this, I think the intended answer is option A: 1.9e-28 Ns, but I'm not sure how to arrive at it.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the question asks for the photon momentum required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis considers both vibrational and rotational transitions, as the next state could involve either a change in vibrational state (v=0 → v=1) or a rotational state (J=0 → J=1). The energy differences for these transitions are compared to determine which requires the least energy.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Reduced Mass (μ):**
   - Given masses:  
     \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
     \( \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} \).  
     Converting to kilograms:  
     \( \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).

2. **Moment of Inertia (I):**
   - Bond length: \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  
     \( I = \mu \cdot r^2 = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \).

3. **Rotational Constant (B):**
   - \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \).  
     \( B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

4. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition (J=0 → J=1):**
   - \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

5. **Energy Difference for Vibrational Transition (v=0 → v=1):**
   - Angular frequency: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).  
     \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

6. **Photon Momentum:**
   - For a rotational transition:  
     \( p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \).  
   - For a vibrational transition:  
     \( p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \).

### Comparison of Options:
- **Option A:** \( p = 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)  
- **Option B:** \( p = 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)  
- **Option C:** \( p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)  
- **Option D:** \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)  

The calculated momentum for the vibrational transition (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) is closest to **Option A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)), though it is about 4.6 times smaller. None of the options match the rotational transition momentum (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)).

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated values and the provided options, the most reasonable choice based on the vibrational transition is **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
