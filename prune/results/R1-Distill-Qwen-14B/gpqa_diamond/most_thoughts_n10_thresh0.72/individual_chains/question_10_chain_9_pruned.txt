Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the four options has the highest density. Let me read the options again.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because Earth is pretty dense, with a lot of rock and metal. So this one should have the same density as Earth.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but isn't density mass divided by volume? So if the mass is twice Earth's, but the density is the same as Earth, that would mean the volume is also twice as much. Because density is mass/volume, so if density is same, then volume would scale with mass. So this planet's volume is twice Earth's, but same density.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Hmm, same composition means the density should be the same as Earth, right? Because composition determines density. So if it's 5 times more massive, but same density, then its volume would be 5 times that of Earth. So same density as Earth.

Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. Again, same composition means same density. So same as Earth's 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, but the question is about the highest density. So looking at the options, a, b, c, d all have the same density except... Wait, no. Let me look again.

Option a has Earth's density. Option b is 5.5 as well, same as Earth. Option c is same composition, so same density. Option d same as Earth. So all options a, b, c, d have the same density? Then why is the question asking which has the highest?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read again.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So Earth's density.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density 5.5. So same density as Earth. So that's 5.5. 

Option c: Same composition as Earth, so density same as Earth. But 5 times the mass. So even though the mass is higher, the density is same. So same as
