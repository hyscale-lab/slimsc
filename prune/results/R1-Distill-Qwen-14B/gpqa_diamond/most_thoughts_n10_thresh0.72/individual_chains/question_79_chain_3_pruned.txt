Okay, I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the question is about identifying Compound X based on its reaction product's NMR data. The reaction involved 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I remember that this reagent is commonly used in epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially in the presence of a base. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes it's used for other purposes too. Or maybe it's a specific reaction condition for something else. Oh right! 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bicyclic amine often used in the formation of epoxides via the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think that's not right. Wait, Prilezhaev epoxidation uses a different setup. Or maybe it's more about the ring-opening. Wait, no, actually, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Oh, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? It's used in various reactions, perhaps as a base in eliminations or in epoxide formations. Or maybe it's a catalyst for certain reactions. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with other reagents. Oh, another possibility: maybe the compound is undergoing an elimination reaction? Or perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide when treated with such a base. Wait, but the product's NMR is given, so perhaps Compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is something else. Hmm.

But wait, the reaction conditions mention a nonpolar solvent and a temperature of 403 K (which is about 130Â°C). That's quite high. So maybe it's a reaction that requires heat. Let me think about the possible reactions. Oh, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed reaction or a base-catalyzed elimination. Alternatively, maybe the 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is acting as a base, perhaps deprotonating something to cause an elimination.

Wait, but the product's NMR is from the reaction of
