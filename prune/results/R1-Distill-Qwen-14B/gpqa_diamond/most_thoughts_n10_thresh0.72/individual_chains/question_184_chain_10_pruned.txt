Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. Let's see what the target molecule is: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let's break it down.

Starting with benzene, I need to perform a series of reactions to get to this target. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different sequence of steps. So I need to think about each step and see which order makes sense.

Let me visualize the target structure. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, wait. Wait, numbering of the benzene ring is important here. Let me try to sketch it mentally.

Benzene is a six-membered ring. Position 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in order. So, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, making them adjacent. So the substituents are meta to each other? No, wait. Wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), 2 and 3 are adjacent (ortho), and 1 and 3 are meta. Wait, no. 1,2,3 are all in a row, so 1 is next to 2, and 2 is next to 3, but 1 is across from 3 in a benzene ring? No, because in benzene, positions 1,2,3 are consecutive in a triangle. So 1 and 3 are across from each other, but that's not possible because a benzene ring only has six positions around. Wait, no, in a six-membered ring, positions 1 and 4 are opposite. So 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in order. So 1 is ortho to 2, 2 is adjacent to 3, and 1 is meta to 3. Hmm, no, wait, that's not right. Let me number them: positions 1,2,3 would be adjacent in a row around the ring, meaning 1 is next to 2 and 6, 2 is next to 1 and 3, 3 is next to 2 and 4, etc. So substituents at 1, 2, and 3 would be in a row, making each adjacent.

Wait, but the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So all three are adjacent in a row. So the arrangement is ethoxy in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, nitro in 3.

Now, I need to figure out the order in which these groups are introduced.
