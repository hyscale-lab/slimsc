Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can handle it.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can react with each other. So I need to figure out what's going to happen when these three solutions are mixed together. Maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions and see if there's an excess of one over the other. If there's an excess, that will determine the pH. If they neutralize each other exactly, then maybe I have to look for a different approach, like a buffer solution.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution. Moles are calculated as concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). But wait, the volumes are given in mL, so I need to convert them to liters. Right, 1 L is 1000 mL, so I'll divide each volume by 1000.

Starting with the acetic acid: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But when mixed with water, it does release some H+ ions.

Next, the HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. So the moles of H+ from HCl will be 0.08.

Now, the Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. When mixing acids and bases, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. So I should calculate the total H+ and OH- from all sources and see which is in excess.

Let's add up the H+ from both acids. Acetic acid gives 0.05 moles of H+ (since it's a weak acid, but I think for the purpose of neutralization, we might consider it as contributing moles of H+ equal to its moles, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think of it as a weak acid but in the presence of a strong acid and base. Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe I'll proceed and see.)

Wait, actually, when you add a strong acid and a weak acid, the H+ from the strong acid will dominate. But in this case, I also have a strong base. So maybe I should first calculate the net H+ or OH- after all reactions.

Let me think. The H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it's going to provide a lot of OH- ions. The HCl is a strong acid, so it will provide H+. The acetic acid is a weak acid, so it will also contribute H+ but not as much as HCl.

Wait, but when you mix strong acid and strong base, they neutralize each other. The strong acid H+ and strong base OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio.

Let me proceed step by step:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from all sources.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from all sources.
3. Subtract
