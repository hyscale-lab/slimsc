Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can handle it.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can react with each other. So I need to figure out what's going to happen when these three solutions are mixed together. Maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions and see if there's an excess of one over the other. If there's an excess, that will determine the pH. If they neutralize each other exactly, then maybe I have to look for a different approach, like a buffer solution.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution. Moles are calculated as concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). But wait, the volumes are given in mL, so I need to convert them to liters. Right, 1 L is 1000 mL, so I'll divide each volume by 1000.

Starting with the acetic acid: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But when mixed with water, it does release some H+ ions.

Next, the HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. So the moles of H+ from HCl will be 0.08.

Now, the Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. When mixing acids and bases, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So I should calculate the total H+ and OH- from all sources and see which is in excess.

Let's add up the H+ from both acids. Acetic acid gives 0.05 moles of H+ (since it's a weak acid, but I think for the purpose of neutralization, we might consider it as contributing moles of H+ equal to its moles, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think of it as a weak acid but in the presence of a strong acid and base. Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe I'll proceed and see.)

Wait, actually, when you add a strong acid and a weak acid, the H+ from the strong acid will dominate. But in this case, I also have a strong base. So maybe I should first calculate the net H+ or OH- after all reactions.

Let me think. The H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it's going to provide a lot of OH- ions. The HCl is a strong acid, so it will provide H+. The acetic acid is a weak acid, so it will also contribute H+ but not as much as HCl.

Wait, but when you mix strong acid and strong base, they neutralize each other. The strong acid H+ and strong base OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio.

Let me proceed step by step:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from all sources.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from all sources.
3. Subtract

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But the types of acids and bases matter. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the reaction might involve neutralization between the strong acid and strong base first, and then see what's left.

Let me think about the steps I need to take. I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base, then see how they react together.

The solution is made by mixing three different volumes and concentrations. So, maybe the first thing to do is find the total volume. Because the volumes are additive, right? 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL. That adds up to 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters. So the total volume is 1.2 L.

Now, calculate moles for each component.

Starting with CH3COOH (acetic acid). The concentration is 0.1 M, and the volume is 0.5 L (500 mL). Moles = Molarity * Volume. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Next, HCl. It's 0.2 M, 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Concentration is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

So the OH- moles are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let's think about the reactions. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl^- ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will fully dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH^-.

So, the H+ comes from HCl and any excess from other sources, while OH- comes from Ba(OH)2 and maybe from the reaction with H+.

But wait, in the solution, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from HCl. And maybe any excess OH- or H+ will determine the pH.

So first, let's find out how much H+ and OH- we have.

H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles.

When they react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles of H+ available: 0.08
Moles of OH- available: 0.18

They will neutralize each other. Let's see which is in excess.

H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So H+ will be completely neutralized, and there will be leftover OH-.

The remaining OH- after reaction: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, but that's just the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2. What about the acetic acid? Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely. So it might not react with the OH- right away. Or wait, in the presence of excess OH-, would the acetic acid react? Because OH- is a strong base, it can deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait
