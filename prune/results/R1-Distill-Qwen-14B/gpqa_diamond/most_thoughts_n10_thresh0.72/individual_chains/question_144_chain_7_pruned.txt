Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters, so I guess I need to calculate how far the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the decay length is related to the lifetime of the particle. The formula I think is something like decay distance L = c * τ, where c is the speed of light and τ is the mean lifetime. But how do I find τ?

Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Yeah, because the uncertainty in energy (Γ) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (τ) should be on the order of ħ.

So first, I need to compute Γ in appropriate units. Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, but I need to convert that into energy in units that match ħ. Oh wait, since Γ is in MeV, I can work in natural units where c=1 and ħ is in MeV·seconds or something. Wait, I should probably convert Γ from MeV to GeV because E_X is in GeV, but maybe it's better to handle the units carefully.

Wait, let's get the units straight. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is 320 MeV. Since 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s? No, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.58
