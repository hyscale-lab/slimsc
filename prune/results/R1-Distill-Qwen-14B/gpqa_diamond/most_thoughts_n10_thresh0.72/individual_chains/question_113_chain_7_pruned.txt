Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what information I've been given.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options for the chemical formula are four different ones. I'll need to analyze each piece of data to narrow it down.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a very broad peakâ€”could that be a broad O-H from an alcohol or perhaps a carboxylic acid? Or maybe an ether? No, ethers don't have O-H. So likely, either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or maybe a phenol. But phenols have a broader peak, maybe? Hmm.

Then there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is a typical carbonyl for a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 is a bit lower, which might suggest maybe a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, but 1650 could also be an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated double bond, like in an alkene adjacent to the carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the molecule must have a double bond somewhere. That's a key point.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, what fragments give a mass of 45? Well, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3CO (which is 45: 12+16+16 = 44, wait, no. Wait, 12+3*(1) + 16 +1
