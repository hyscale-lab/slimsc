Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about planets transiting and occultation around a star. I remember that transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, and the planet's light is blocked, so we don't see it anymore. Both events require the planets to be in the same orbital plane as seen from Earth, which they are here.

The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius. Its star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period is 3 days. The question is about a second planet with 2.5 Earth radii. They want the maximum orbital period for the second planet such that both transit and occultation occur.

Wait, why is the orbital period important here? Oh right, because the timing of when each planet transits affects when the other's transit can be observed. For both transits and occultations, the orbital periods must be such that their transits (and occultations) happen at the same point in their orbits relative to each other and the star.

I think the key here is about orbital periods and when their transits coincide. If two planets are to have their transits and occultations observed, their orbital periods must be in a harmonic ratio, maybe. Or perhaps the ratio relates to the times when they line up in the same direction relative to the star.

Wait, perhaps the synodic period comes into play here. The synodic period is the time between similar events as seen from Earth, like two transits of the same planet. But wait, in this case, we have two different planets. So maybe their orbital periods need to be such that their transits and occultations can happen at the same time.

Alternatively, I remember that for a planet to both transit and occult, the other planet must be on the opposite side of the star during the transit. Wait, no, not necessarily. Let me think again.

When a planet transits, it's moving from our perspective in front of the star. Then, during occultation, it moves behind. So, for a second planet to also transit and occult, it must be in a position where its orbital period allows it to be on the same side during the first planet's transit and then on the opposite side during the occultation. Or maybe the other way around.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe a better approach is to think about the orbital periods and how their relative speeds affect when they can transit each other's line of sight.

Wait, the first planet has an orbital period of 3 days. The second has a longer period, which we're trying to find. Let's call the second planet's period P.

Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, their transits will occur at the same time when they are aligned in the same direction relative to the star. But for both to have transits and occultations, the timing must be right so that when the first planet transits, the second is also transiting, and when the first is occulted, the second is on the opposite side, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the condition is that the orbital period of the second planet must be a multiple or a fraction of the
