Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is about a spin-half particle in a specific state, and we're asked to find the expectation value of an operator. The state is given as a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. We need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Expectation values... right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect to measure in an experiment. For a given state |ψ⟩, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

So, the first thing I should do is find the expectation values of σz and σx separately, then combine them with their coefficients.

Let me write down the state ψ. It's 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Oh wait, I should check if this is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the coefficients: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2. 0.25 plus (3/4) is 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, let's find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz is just the weighted average of their eigenvalues. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So ψ is a linear combination, so ⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1). Let's compute that. |0.5|² is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|² is (3/4), so 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now for σx. Hmm. I remember that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The eigenstates of σx are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.

But wait, to find the expectation value of σx for a given state, I can also use the formula ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Alternatively, since σx can be written as a matrix, I can compute the matrix product.

Wait, maybe I should express σx in terms of its basis. The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

So, the state ψ is a column vector: [0.5, sqrt(3
