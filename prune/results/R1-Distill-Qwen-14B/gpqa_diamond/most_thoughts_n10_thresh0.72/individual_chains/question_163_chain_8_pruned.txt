Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these solubility and acid-base reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it's a base. To dissolve it, we'll probably need an acid because acid-base reactions typically neutralize each other. So the acid will react with the hydroxide to form water and the corresponding salt.

First, let's figure out the chemical equation. Fe(OH)3 is reacting with a strong monobasic acid, like HCl or HNO3. The reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O.

Wait, but actually, since it's a strong acid, it will dissociate completely, and each mole of H+ will react with a mole of OH- from Fe(OH)3. So the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, no. Wait, Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 provides 3 moles of OH-? Or wait, no. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a base, so when it reacts with an acid, each OH- will react with an H+.

But wait, Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so it's not in solution. So to dissolve it, the acid must provide H+ ions which will react with the OH- ions in Fe(OH)3.

So the reaction equation should be Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 H2O(l).

Yes, that makes sense. So for every mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+ ions.

Now, let's compute the moles of Fe(OH)3 we have.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3:
