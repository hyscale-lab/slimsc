Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what value a certain DNA sequence gives based on an algorithm. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. Then I have to find the value for ACAGTGACC. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, let's start by trying to figure out what the algorithm is doing. DNA sequences are made up of four nucleotides: A, T, C, G. So the input is a string of these letters, and the output is a number. I need to find a pattern or a rule that converts the input into the output.

Looking at the first example: AGG gives 115. Let's break down AGG. There are three letters, which would be a triplet. Wait, but let me think about the possible values each letter could contribute. Maybe each nucleotide is assigned a number, and the algorithm sums them up. But let's check.

So, for AGG: each letter A, G, G. If each A is 1, G is 3, then 1 + 3 + 3 = 7, which doesn't match 115. That can't be right. Maybe it's based on the position in the alphabet? A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. Let me try that. So AGG would be 1 (A) + 7 (G) +7 (G) = 15. Hmm, but the output is 115. That's way higher.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a two-digit number. Like A is 10, T is 20, C is 30, G is 40? Let's see: AGG would be 10 +40 +40 =90. Still not 115. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the algorithm is summing the ASCII values of each character. Let me check. The ASCII value for 'A' is 65, 'G' is 71. So AGG is 65 +71 +71 = 207. No, that's more than 115. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe each nucleotide is converted to a number, and then the entire string is treated as a base-10 number. Like each letter represents a digit. For example, A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. So let's see:

First example: AGG. So digits would be 1,4,4. The number would be 144. But 144 is not 115. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's binary or another base? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps each pair of letters is used to calculate a value. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a value, and the algorithm is multiplying the values. For AGG: A=1, G=3, G=3. So 1*3*3=9. Not 115.

Hmm, maybe the algorithm uses the length of the string in a specific way. AGG is length 3. 115 divided by 3 is about 38.3. Not sure if that helps.

Another angle: perhaps the algorithm is adding the positions of the nucleotides in the sequence. For example, the first nucleotide contributes 1×A's value, the second 2×, etc. Let's try that.

If that's the case, for AGG: A is position 1, G is position 2, G is position 3.

If each nucleotide is assigned a value: A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4.

Then AGG would be (1×1) + (2×4) + (3×4) = 1 + 8 +12 =21. Not 115. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the values are higher. What if A=5, T=6, C=7, G=8?

Then AGG would be (1×5) + (2×8) + (3×8) =5 +16 +24=45. Still not 115.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is weighted by 10, 100, etc. For example, if the sequence is read as digits in a number. Let me think.

Wait, the output numbers are 115 and 176. Let's see. 115 is a three-digit number. TGCTGA is a six-letter sequence, output 176 is a three-digit number as well. So perhaps the algorithm is converting each pair of letters into a two-digit number, or combining numbers in some other way.

Wait, another thought: maybe each nucleotide is converted into a number, and the sum is multiplied by the length of the sequence. Let's see:

AGG is 3 letters. Let's say each A=1, G=4. So sum is 1 +4 +4=9. 9 ×3=27. Not 115.

Hmm. Another approach: looking for a pattern between the input and output.

AGG → 115

TGCTGA →176

Let me write down the letters and their positions.

AGG is A G G.

Possible approach: maybe each nucleotide is represented by a two-digit number, like A=10, T=20, C=30, G=40. Then for AGG, it would be 10 +40 +40=90. But 90 is less than 115. So perhaps it's adding the individual digits.

Wait, 10 (A) →
