Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, meaning each is present in equal intensity. Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are various tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

First, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Here, C=10, H=14, X=N=0. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees: probably one benzene ring (which accounts for 3) and one double bond or a ring. Wait, but if it's benzene, that's three (as it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds). So the remaining one could be a double bond or another ring. But looking at the options, all are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has diethyl groups.

Wait, the options are a bit different. Let me list them:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That would be four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring in positions 1,2,3,4. What's that structure look like? It's like a benzene with four methyl groups at adjacent positions. So maybe it's actually 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would have all four adjacentâ€”like, positions 1,2,3,4 in a row. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions. That might lead to some symmetry.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. So positions 1,2,4,5. That's like if you number the benzene with 1,2, then skip 3, then 4,5. So that's a sort of 1,2 and 4,5 positions. Maybe that creates some symmetry.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, but diethyl would be different. So 1,4-diethyl would have two ethyl groups on the benzene, in para positions. So the molecular formula for 1,4-diethylbenzene would be C8H10. But the problem says C10H14. Wait no, wait. Let me think: the molecular formula is C10H14.

Wait, the compounds are all C10H14. Let's see:
