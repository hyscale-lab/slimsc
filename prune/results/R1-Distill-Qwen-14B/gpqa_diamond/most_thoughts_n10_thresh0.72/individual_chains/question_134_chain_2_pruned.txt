Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water, and the enthalpy change is usually exothermic. But wait, how do I approach this?

Let me read the question again. It says we have 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. When these are mixed, I need to find the enthalpy change. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I have to be careful about the units.

Wait, I think the enthalpy of neutralization is typically calculated per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved. Oh right, because each acid contributes H+ ions, and the base contributes OH- ions. The reaction between them forms water, releasing heat.

So first, I need to calculate the moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4, and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+. So moles HCl = 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each mole gives 2 moles of H+. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18.

Adding those together, total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now for the base, Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait a minute, the H+ and OH- moles are 0.28 and 0.2 respectively. Since H+ is more, the OH- will neutralize some of it, and there'll be excess H+.

So the neutralization reaction would be: H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ and OH- produces one mole of water, releasing about 57 kJ per mole (but wait, I think the enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases). Wait, I should double-check that. Oh yes, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+.

So, but in this case, the limiting reagent is OH- because we have 0.2 moles of OH- and 0.28 of H+. So all the OH- will react, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain.

So the total enthalpy change would be based on the moles of H+ and OH- that react. So 0.2 moles of H+ react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the enthalpy change should be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol). Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Oh, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So let me calculate that.

0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have some in kcal, some in kJ. Let me see the options.

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, because 11.4 kJ is about 2.73 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).
