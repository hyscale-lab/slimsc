Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again and try to break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and various reactions they undergo. My goal is to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.

Let me start by jotting down the key points from the question.

1. Five binary compounds of fluorine with Y exist. So Y has five different compounds where it's combined with fluorine. That suggests Y is a non-metal that can form multiple fluorides. Common elements with multiple fluorides include oxygen, sulfur, maybe chlorine or others, but chlorine is a halogen, so maybe not. Let's think: oxygen has O2F2, OF2, maybe others? Or sulfur? Sulfur can form SF4, SF6, etc.

2. Substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF% of A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oF usually refers to oxidation state, but maybe it's the atomic percentage? Or perhaps it's the formula? Hmm, maybe 'ɷF' stands for the F content. Let me think: if A2 has F content of 31.96%, that's about 31.96% by mass. Let me calculate what that could be.

Assuming A2 is YF_x, we can find the formula. Let's say the molecular weight of Y is M, and F is 19 (approx). So (19x)/(M + 19x) = 0.3196. Let's try to find integer x that makes sense. Let's plug in some possible x:

If x=3: (57)/(M +57)=0.3196 → M+57=57/0.3196 ≈ 178 → M≈121. Hmm, that's about the atomic weight of Te (128), but maybe not exact. Or wait, maybe Y is sulfur which has an atomic weight around 32.

Wait, let's try x=2: (38)/(M +38) = 0.3196 → M+38 ≈ 38 / 0.3196 ≈ 118.8 → M≈80.8. That's around the atomic weight of Br, which is 79.9. Hmm.

Wait, but if Y is Br, then let's see what else applies. Wait, but let's hold that thought and look at other clues.

A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So A1 → A2 + F2. Considering that fluorine is a product, which is F2, so A1 must have more fluorine than A2. Maybe A1 is a higher fluoride than A2. For example, if A1 is YF6 and A2 is YF4. Then, decomposition would reduce the F count.

But wait, if A1 is a bright red substance, that makes me think of fluorine compounds with sulfur or oxygen. Wait, sulfur hexafluoride is SF6, which is colorless. Wait, but maybe oxygen? Ozone isn't really relevant here. Wait, another thought: could A1 be ClF3? No, that's not red. Hmm, maybe I'm off track.

Another point: A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas; being oxidized means it's acting as a reducing agent. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so perhaps A1 is a fluoride that's a strong oxidizer. Maybe Y is oxygen? But oxygen's fluorides are not common. Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine, but ClF3 and others are possible.

Wait, but another approach:
