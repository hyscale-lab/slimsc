Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some immune response processes. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the setup is that someone tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave it to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid and some got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They found the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability.

Hmm, what's going on here? I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses to enteric pathogens are initiated. So when the rotavirus is given orally, it likely gets processed in the gut.

The fact that some GFP was destroyed by stomach acid probably means that not all the viral particles made it through. Stomach acid can denature proteins, so maybe some of the capsid proteins were broken down before they could be taken up by the immune system.

The ones that didn't get destroyed probably made it through the mucus and reached the Peyer's patches. So the immune cells there, like dendritic cells or macrophages, would take up the viral antigens. Then, these antigens are presented to T and B cells.

Now, the key point is the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cells. That makes me think about the immune response mechanisms that generate diversity in antibodies. I remember that B cells undergo several processes that increase antibody diversity.

The options given are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ recombination happens during the generation of the initial B cell receptor (BCR) diversity in the bone marrow. It's part of the process where different V, D, and J segments are joined to create the variable region of the heavy chain. But this happens during B cell development, not necessarily after antigen exposure.

Class switching recombination (CSR) is when the class of the antibody (like from IgM to IgG) is changed. This process occurs after the initial immune response and is mediated by activation signals, typically involving CD40 and cytokines. It doesn't directly affect the variable regions, just the constant region.

Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is a process that occurs in antigen-experienced B cells, usually in the germinal centers. Here, the B cells undergo hypermutation in the variable regions of their heavy and light chains, which increases the diversity of the antibodies produced. This allows the immune system to fine-tune the response and generate higher-affinity antibodies.

So, in this scenario, the B cells in the Peyer's patches are likely undergoing a secondary immune response. The high variability in the variable heavy chains suggests that each B cell has a slightly different sequence, which is a result of somatic hypermutation. Germinal centers are where this process happens, and Peyer's patches have these structures.

Wait, but Peyer's patches are more about the initial encounter, right? Or do they have the capacity for germinal centers? I think that secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches do have the necessary structures for B cell activation and proliferation, including germinal centers. So, when the rotavirus antigen is presented, the B cells get activated, form germinal centers, and undergo SHM, leading to the high variability in their variable regions.

So the process happening here is somatic hypermutation. That would make the answer A.

Complement activation (B) doesn't directly relate to the variability in the variable regions. It's more about opsonization and clearing pathogens.

So I think the correct answer is A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Stomach acid destroys some of the fluorescence, while others are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. The fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are critical for initiating immune responses to enteric pathogens. The observed fluorescence suggests that some rotavirus particles evade stomach acid and mucus to reach these patches. Within the Peyer's patches, immune cells, such as dendritic cells or macrophages, take up the viral antigens and present them to B cells. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cells points to a process that generates diversity in antibodies.

Among the options:

- **VDJ recombination (D)** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region. This happens early in B cell development and is not relevant here, as the question focuses on antigen-experienced B cells.
- **Class switching recombination (C)** changes the class of the antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and does not affect the variable regions.
- **Complement activation (B)** is involved in opsonization and pathogen clearance but does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chains.
- **Somatic hypermutation (A)** occurs in antigen-experienced B cells within germinal centers, where the variable regions of the heavy and light chains undergo hypermutation. This process increases antibody diversity and fine-tunes the immune response, consistent with the high variability observed in the variable heavy chains.

Given that Peyer's patches contain germinal centers and the experiment involves an antigen-experienced B cell population, the process responsible for the observed variability is somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
