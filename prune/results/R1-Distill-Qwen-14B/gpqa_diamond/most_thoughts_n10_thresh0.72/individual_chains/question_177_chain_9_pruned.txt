Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question says that astronomers are looking at two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They found that both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Hmm, same peak wavelength. Oh right, that must relate to their temperatures. Because according to Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if λ_max is the same, the temperatures must be the same. Oh wait, but wait, the question says they have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. So T1 = T2? Because Wien's displacement law says λ_max * T = constant. So if the wavelength is same, then temperature is same.

So both stars have the same temperature. Got it.

Now, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Wait, radial velocity is usually the component of a star's velocity along the observer's line of sight. But how does that affect luminosity? Or maybe it's about their actual velocities, but I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, maybe this is a red herring because the question says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, and they've already calculated the luminosities. Wait, the question says that after calculating, the luminosity
