Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, but I'm not going to peek right now—I'll work it out.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider the neutralization reactions. But wait, there are multiple acids and a base here. Let me think. So, the first thing I need to do is figure out how much of each acid and base is present in moles, then see what's reacting.

Let's break it down. First, calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with CH3COOH. Its concentration is 0.1 M, and volume is 500 mL. Moles = Molarity × Volume in liters. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of acetic acid.

Next, HCl. 0.2 M and 400 mL. So 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Its concentration is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL. So 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So, moles of OH- would be 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles. I'll have to remember that.

Now, the next step is to figure out the reactions between these substances. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, the H+ ions from both acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base,
