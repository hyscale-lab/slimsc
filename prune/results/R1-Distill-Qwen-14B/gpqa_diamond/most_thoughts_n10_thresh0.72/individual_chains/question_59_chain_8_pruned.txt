Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution after mixing different amounts of acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So, I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base present and see what's left after neutralization.

Let's break down each component step by step.

The first solution is 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But for the neutralization part, I think I just need the moles of H+ it can provide. Wait, no, because when you mix it with a base, the H+ from the acid will react with the OH- from the base. So, I should calculate the moles of each.

Moles of CH3COOH: Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it will donate H+ ions, but maybe in the presence of a strong base, it'll react. I'll have to consider that later.

Next, the HCl. It's 400 mL of 0.2 M. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate. Moles of HCl = 0.2 × 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl gives 1 mole of H+ per mole, that's 0.08 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2 is 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 × 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So OH- moles = 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when these solutions are mixed, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but wait. HCl is a strong acid, so its H+ is fully available. CH3COOH is weak, so it's not as available. But when mixed with a base, the OH- will react with all available H+.

Wait, I think the reaction would proceed as:

H+ (from acids) + OH- → H2O.

So, the H+ comes from both HCl and CH3COOH. But since HCl is a strong acid, it's fully ionized, so all its H+ is available. CH3COOH isn't, but when you mix it with a base, the H+ it can donate will react with OH-.

Wait, but in a solution, the weak acid might not fully dissociate, but when you have excess base, the weak acid's H+ can be neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture and see which

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, but I'm not going to peek right now—I'll work it out.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider the neutralization reactions. But wait, there are multiple acids and a base here. Let me think. So, the first thing I need to do is figure out how much of each acid and base is present in moles, then see what's reacting.

Let's break it down. First, calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with CH3COOH. Its concentration is 0.1 M, and volume is 500 mL. Moles = Molarity × Volume in liters. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of acetic acid.

Next, HCl. 0.2 M and 400 mL. So 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Its concentration is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL. So 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So, moles of OH- would be 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles. I'll have to remember that.

Now, the next step is to figure out the reactions between these substances. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, the H+ ions from both acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base,
