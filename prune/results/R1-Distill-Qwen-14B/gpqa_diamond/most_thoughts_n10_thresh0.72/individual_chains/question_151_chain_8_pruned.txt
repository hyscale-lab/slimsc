Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I remember that when you have an observable represented by a matrix, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. And the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is calculated using the eigenvectors and the state vector of the system.

The problem gives me the state vector at time t as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, let's write that down. So the state vector is:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1 ]
         2 
         1

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The norm would be the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

So (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state vector isn't normalized. Wait, but does that matter? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, right? So perhaps I should normalize it before proceeding.

So the normalized state vector would be (1/sqrt(6)) times [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. But wait, the problem didn't specify whether it's normalized. Hmm, but in the context of observables, the probabilities depend on the square of the inner product with the eigenvectors. So I think I should normalize it first. Otherwise, the probabilities might add up to more than 1.

Alright, let's proceed. The
