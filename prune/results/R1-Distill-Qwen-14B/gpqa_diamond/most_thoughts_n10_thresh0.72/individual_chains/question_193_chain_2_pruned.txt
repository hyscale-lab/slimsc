Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. I'm supposed to find out how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, involving different powers of r.

Hmm, right. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of the distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if I have plx, distance d is 1/plx. Wait, no, actually wait. Parallax is in arcseconds, and the formula is d (in parsecs) = 1/plx. Oh wait, right, the distance modulus comes into play. So for a star, the distance d (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax. So d = 1/plx.

But here, the number of stars N is varying with plx as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So that's N = k * (1/(plx))^5, where k is some constant.

Wait, the question is about how N changes with distance. So I need to express N in terms of distance r (I think r here is the same as d, the distance). So let's substitute plx in terms of d. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d.

So substituting into N: N ∝ (1/plx)^5 → N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but that would make N proportional to d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So the number per unit distance, like the change as you go a little further, say from r to r + dr.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's about the number of stars in that region as a function of distance. So perhaps it's considering the differential, like the number density. Because when you're counting stars, if the density is higher, more stars per unit volume as you go further.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. And
