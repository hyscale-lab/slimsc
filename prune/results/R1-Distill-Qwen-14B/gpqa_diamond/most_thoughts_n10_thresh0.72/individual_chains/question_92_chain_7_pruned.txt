Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is: Calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. They've provided some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The options are given, but I need to think through the solution step by step.

Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation of a compound can be calculated using bond energies. The general approach is to consider breaking all the bonds in the reactants (elements) and then forming all the bonds in the product. Oh wait, wait—the enthalpy of formation is the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, maybe I need to calculate the difference between the energy required to break bonds in the reactants and the energy released when forming bonds in the product.

Wait, the formula I think is: ΔH = sum(bond energies broken) - sum(bond energies formed). Or is it the other way around? Let me think. When bonds are broken, energy is absorbed, so that's the first part. When bonds form, energy is released, so that's subtracted. So I think the formula is ΔH = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds formed). Or wait, no, maybe it's the reverse. Because, enthalpy of formation is the energy change when forming the compound. So if you're starting from elements, you have to break the bonds in the elements (like C-C in graphite, maybe?), and form the bonds in the compound.

But wait, the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. So maybe I should use that instead. Oh right! The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element to form atoms. So for carbon, which is probably in its standard state as graphite, the bond energy is given as 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, the bond energy for C-C is already given as 200 kJ/mol. Wait wait, wait a second, the question says, "Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." Oh, I think the enthalpy of atomization is
