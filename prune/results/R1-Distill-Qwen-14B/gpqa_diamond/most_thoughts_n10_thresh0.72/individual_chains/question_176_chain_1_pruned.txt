Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that seems a bit odd because usually, quantum states are represented as column vectors with complex numbers, and the probabilities should add up correctly. Let me check: the sum of squares here would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1+4+1=6. Oh, right, so maybe the state is not normalized. That's a point to remember because when calculating probabilities, we might need to normalize the state.

The operators for P and Q are given as square matrices. Let me write them down to get a clearer picture.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait, that's interesting. So Q is a diagonal matrix. The eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1. Because the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues for a diagonal matrix. So when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

And P's matrix is more complicated. I'll need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P to determine the possible outcomes when measuring P.

But wait, the question is about measuring P first, then immediately measuring Q. Or is it the other way around? Let me read the question again. It says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the sequence is first measure P, then measure Q. The probabilities are for getting 0 in P and -1 in Q.

Wait, no, the question says, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So first, measure P and get 0, then measure Q and get -1.
