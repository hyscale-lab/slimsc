Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

Alright, the first part is reaction A: (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi, then H+. The second part is the Cope rearrangement of some complex molecule when heated, giving product B.

Starting with reaction A. The starting material is a benzene ring with an attached group. Let me draw that out mentally. The substituent on benzene is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Wait, that's a bit complicated. So, the structure is a benzene ring connected to a CH2-O- group, and then the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait. Let me think again. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a methyl on C3. Oh wait, but the numbering. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, that's five carbons. Wait no, but but-2-en-1-yl is four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 2 and 3. Wait, no. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- (but that's 3 carbons, but the but implies four. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2C=CH2, but with a methyl group on the third carbon. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, maybe I should write it down. Let's see: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that can't be right because butenyl is four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but that's five carbons
