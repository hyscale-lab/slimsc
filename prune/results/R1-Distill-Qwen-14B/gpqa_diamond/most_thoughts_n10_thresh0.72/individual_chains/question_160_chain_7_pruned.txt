Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with all apothems of the same length a. Monochromatic light is shining along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and we can approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Wait, so when the aperture is a regular polygon with many sides, as N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon becomes indistinguishable from a circle. So the problem might be simplifying to a circular aperture case when N is very large.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture, I remember something about the first minima in the diffraction pattern. The single-slit diffraction pattern has a central maximum, and the first minima occur at specific angles.

Right, the diffraction pattern for a single slit has a central bright spot, and the intensity minima occur at angles where a sin(theta) = m * lambda/2, where m is an integer, and m=±1, ±2, etc. The first minima would be at m=1, so sin(theta) = lambda/(2a). But wait, wait, for a circular aperture, it's different. Oh wait, no—wait, a circular aperture actually produces a diffraction pattern known as the Airy disk. The minima
