Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: We have a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. We need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Hmm, right. So I remember that divergence is a measure of how much the vector field is spreading out or converging at a point. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of divergence to the flux through the surface. But wait, the divergence theorem says ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal. 

But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Let me think. The problem is asking for the integral of the divergence, so maybe I can compute it directly in spherical coordinates.

Since the field is radial and depends only on r, I can use the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field F that's purely radial, F = F(r) r̂. The divergence of this field is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)). 

In this case, F(r) is 1/r². So let me plug that into the formula. 

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let's compute that. 

r² * 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin? Because at r=0, the field might have a singularity.

Wait, but the vector field here is f(r) = 1/r² in the radial direction. So f(r) can be written as f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

So let me compute the divergence again:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where the field might not be defined. But when we integrate over the volume, including the origin, this might relate to a point source.

Wait, but Gauss's law for electric fields comes to
