Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm, right, I remember that the divergence theorem relates volume integrals to surface integrals, but let me think.

The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So, in spherical coordinates, the field must be f(r) = (something) e_r. Since it's radial and 1/r², that makes me think of electric fields, like Coulomb's law. Oh wait, the electric field due to a point charge is radial and proportional to 1/r². But wait, in that case, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. Or is that right?

Wait, I'm trying to recall. The divergence of a radial field that depends only on r. So, for a vector field F(r) = f(r) e_r, where f(r) = 1/r². The divergence in spherical coordinates, I think, is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r) ). So substituting F_r = 1/r², that would make it (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ). Simplifying inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence would be zero, right?

Wait, but that can't be right for the entire space. Because, wait, if the divergence is zero everywhere except r=0, then the volume integral over any volume that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But if the origin is included, like in this case where the sphere is centered at the origin, then maybe there's a delta function or something.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The divergence of F = (1/r²) e_r. So using the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. So, divergence ∇·F is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r) ). Plugging F_r = 1/r²:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr (1)
