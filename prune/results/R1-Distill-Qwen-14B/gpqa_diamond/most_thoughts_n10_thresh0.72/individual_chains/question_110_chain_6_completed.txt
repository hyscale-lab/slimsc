Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, I should understand the capabilities of both instruments. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. That means it can see stars up to about magnitude 17 or lower. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, anything with V mag ≤16 can be seen by HIRES, but ESPRESSO goes a bit fainter, up to 17.

But wait, I think I should read that again. Oh right, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag in V can be observed. So if a star is at 17 mag or brighter (which is a lower number), it's observable. Same with HIRES: brighter than 16 mag. So stars with V mag ≤16 are observable by HIRES, and those up to ≤17 by ESPRESSO.

So, to find which stars can be detected by both, I need to check which stars have V magnitudes within both limits. So they must have V magnitudes ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's within both limits, but if it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it.

But wait, maybe I should think about the apparent magnitude because that's what the instruments can observe. Because absolute magnitude is a measure of intrinsic brightness, but apparent magnitude depends on distance. So each star's apparent V magnitude is what matters here.

Wait, looking at the stars:

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, at 10 pc. So apparent V mag = absolute mag when distance is 10 pc because the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So M is 15.5, d=10, so m = 15.5 + 0 =15.5. So Star1 has m=15.5.

Star2: Apparent V mag is given as 16.5. So m=16.5.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but wait, do I need to consider extinction (dust) which would make it appear dimmer? Because Star3 has E(B-V) = 0.6 mag. Oh right, the question says that the total absorption in V is 3.1 times E(B-V). So extinction in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).

So for Star3, E(B-V) is 0.6, so A_V = 3.1 *0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude is already observed, but if there's extinction, the star appears fainter. So I think when we get the observed magnitude, it's higher because extinction makes it dimmer. So the actual apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, but for Star3, the given apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but that's the observed value after extinction, right? No, wait, I'm a bit confused. The problem says that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So does that mean the observed apparent V mag is 15.5, or the intrinsic without extinction is something else?

Wait, the question states for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) =0.6 mag." So I think that the given apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction. Or wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think. E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference between the observed color and the intrinsic color. So the extinction in V band is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, A_V is 1.86. So the observed apparent magnitude is m = m_true + A_V. So m_true = m_observed - A_V?

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way: The star's light is dimmed by extinction, so the apparent magnitude increases (since lower mag is brighter). So if the star's intrinsic magnitude (without extinction) is m0, then the observed magnitude is m = m0 + A_V.

So Star3's apparent magnitude is given without considering extinction? Or is it given as observed? The question says, for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So I think that the apparent magnitude is the one after extinction. Because E(B-V) is the observed color excess. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude is the observed value, and the extinction would mean that the actual intrinsic brightness is brighter. So perhaps the apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, in that case, the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V. But wait, no, that's not right. Because if a star is at m=15.5, but extinction adds 1.86, then without extinction, it would have been m =15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But that's not relevant because the question gives Star3's apparent V mag as 15.5, which already includes the extinction.

Wait, but for the purpose of determining if the star is observable by the spectrographs, we need the apparent V magnitude as observed, because that's what the instruments detect.

Hmm, no, wait. Because extinction (dust) makes stars appear dimmer (higher magnitudes). So if a star's apparent magnitude (without extinction) is brighter than the instrument's limit, extinction could make it dimmer beyond the limit. Alternatively, if the star is intrinsically bright enough, even with extinction, it might still be within the limit.

But wait, the question gives the apparent magnitudes as observed, right? For example, Star2's apparent V mag is 16.5. So that's what the telescope would see. So perhaps for Star3, the apparent V mag is 15.5, but after considering extinction, perhaps that's not the case. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify:

If a star's light is affected by extinction (dust in the interstellar medium), its apparent magnitude in the V band would be higher (dimmer) than it would be without extinction. So if the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m0, then the observed m is m = m0 + A_V.

So if Star3's apparent magnitude (observed) is 15.5, then without extinction, it would have been m0 = 15.5 - A_V = 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64. But I don't think that's necessary because the question states that the apparent magnitude is 15.5; that's what the instrument detects. So I don't need to adjust it. Because for the purpose of detecting it, the instrument sees the observed magnitude, which includes extinction.

Wait, but that might not matter for the question. Because for each star, whether it's observable by the instruments depends on the apparent V magnitude it presents to the telescope. So for example, if a star's apparent magnitude is 16.5, it's within HIRES's limit (≤16), but not ESPRESSO's (since ESPRESSO can go up to 17). Wait, no: the question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So if a star is at 17 mag or brighter (i.e., 17 or less), ESPRESSO can detect it. Wait, no—because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star at V=17 is brighter than V=18, etc. So if a star has apparent V mag of 16, both can see it. If it's 17, only ESPRESSO can see it. If it's 16.5, HIRES can see it (since 16.5 ≤16? No, wait: wait, the question says HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So a star with V mag ≤16 is brighter than 16, so it can be observed by HIRES. If V mag is 16.5, it's dimmer than 16, so only ESPRESSO can see it.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So the apparent V mag must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO. Same for HIRES: apparent V mag must be ≤16.

So a star must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be observable by both. Because if it's ≤16, it's within both limits. If it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it.

So for each star, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude and see if it's ≤16 for both instruments.

So let's go through each star.

Star1: RA=15, DEC=-75, absolute V=15.5, distance 10 pc.

Since the distance is 10 pc, the apparent V mag (m) is the same as absolute magnitude (M), because m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, log10(1)=0, m=15.5.

So m=15.5. So it's ≤16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it.

Star2: RA=30, DEC=55, apparent V=16.5, distance 5 pc.

Wait, but wait, the apparent magnitude is given as 16.5. So m=16.5.

But wait, wait, the distance is 5 pc. If the star's absolute magnitude is M, then m = M +5 log10(5/10) = M +5 log10(0.5) = M +5*(-0.3010)= M -1.505.

But the problem states that Star2's apparent V mag is 16.5. So 16.5 = M -1.505 → M=16.5 +1.505=18.005. But that might not be relevant because the question gives the apparent magnitude directly.

Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, the apparent magnitude is given as 16.5. So m=16.5.

So for the instruments:

HIRES can see up to 16 mag. So 16.5 is above that. So Star2 cannot be seen by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO (since 16.5 ≤17). So Star2 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48, apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance=15 pc.

Hmm, but wait, the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but perhaps that's the observed magnitude, including extinction. Or is that the intrinsic magnitude before extinction?

Wait, no. The question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 mag." So I think that the 15.5 is the observed apparent magnitude, including extinction.

Wait, but earlier, the problem says that the total absorption in V band is A_V =3.1*E(B-V). So for Star3, A_V=3.1*0.6=1.86 mag.

But if the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m0, then m_observed = m0 + A_V.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the star's light is dimmed by extinction. So the apparent magnitude increases (becomes larger) because extinction makes it fainter. So if a star's true apparent magnitude is m0 (without extinction), then with extinction, the observed m is m0 + A_V.

So if Star3's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, then without extinction, it would be m0 = 15.5 - A_V =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that doesn't matter because the question gives the observed apparent magnitude as 15.5. So as it appears to the telescope, m=15.5.

So Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is ≤16. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the apparent magnitude in the telescope includes the extinction. So the star's m is 15.5, which is within both instruments' limits. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because if the star's true m is 13.64, and then with extinction, it appears as 15.5, which is still bright enough for both instruments.

So for the purpose of the question, the apparent V magnitudes as provided are the ones that matter.

So moving on:

Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48, absolute V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance=10 pc.

So apparent V mag needs to be calculated.

Since distance is 10 pc, m = M +5 log10(10/10) = 15.5 +0 =15.5.

But wait, Star4 has E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V=3.1 *0.4 =1.24 mag.

So the observed m is m_observed= m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait, but m_intrinsic is 15.5, which is the apparent magnitude without extinction. So with extinction, the observed m becomes 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, but wait. How did I get that? Because, again, the star's light is dimmed by extinction. So the apparent magnitude increases by A_V.

Wait, but in the case of Star4, the apparent magnitude without considering extinction would be 15.5, but with extinction, it's 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So the observed m is 16.74.

So now, Star4's apparent V mag is 16.74. So for HIRES, which can see up to 16 mag, 16.74 is too faint. So Star4 can only be observed by ESPRESSO, since 16.74 ≤17.

Wait, but wait a minute. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up intrinsic and apparent magnitudes.

In Star4's case: The absolute magnitude is 15.5, and it's at 10 pc. So without any extinction, the apparent magnitude would be 15.5 (since m = M +5 log10(10/10) =15.5 +0).

But there's extinction, so the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So the actual apparent magnitude that the telescope would measure is 16.74.

So Star4's apparent V is 16.74. So for HIRES (max 16), it's too faint. Only ESPRESSO can detect it.

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, absolute V=16.5, distance=5 pc.

So m = M +5 log10(d/10) → d=5 pc, so 5 log10(0.5)=5*(-0.301)= -1.505.

So m =16.5 + (-1.505)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0.

So apparent V is 15.0.

So Star5's m=15.0.

Now, considering whether it's affected by extinction.

Star5's E(B-V) isn't given, so perhaps there's no extinction. The problem states that Star5 has absolute V mag of 16.5 and is located at 5 pc. No mention of E(B-V), so I'll assume it's zero. So m=15.0.

So apparent V mag is 15.0, which is ≤16. So both spectrographs can see it.

Now, let's list each star and whether they can be seen by both, ESPRESSO only, HIRES only, or neither.

Star1: m=15.5 → ≤16 → both.

Star2: m=16.5 → HIRES can't (needs ≤16); ESPRESSO can.

Star3: m=15.5 → both.

Wait wait, earlier I thought Star3's m is 15.5. But wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but it has E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=1.86. So does that affect the apparent magnitude?

Wait, no, because the apparent magnitude given is already the observed value. Because the problem says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag."

So A_V is 1.86, but that's the extinction causing the star to appear fainter. So if the apparent magnitude after extinction is 15.5, then without extinction, it's 13.64. But since the instruments see the observed magnitude (15.5), which is within HIRES's limit (≤16), so both can detect it.

Wait, but no: if the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is ≤16, so both can detect it.

Wait, but I'm confused because in Star4's case, the apparent magnitude went from 15.5 to 16.74 due to extinction. So for Star3, if the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which includes extinction, then it's within both instruments.

Wait, but wait, wait. If the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is after extinction, then that's what matters. So Star3's m is 15.5, so both can see it.

So now, for each star:

Star1: m=15.5 → both.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5 → both.

Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15.0 → both.

Now, the question is which stars can be detected with both spectrographs.

So which stars have m ≤16?

Star1: yes.

Star3: yes.

Star5: yes.

Others: no.

So the possible options are stars that are in both instruments.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, which is beyond HIRES's limit. So A is incorrect.

Option B) Star3 and Star5 → both have m=15.5 and 15.0, which are ≤16. So both can be detected by both, so B is a possible option.

Option C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO can detect it. So C is incorrect.

Option D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is okay, Star4's m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought Star5 is also observable by both.

Wait the options are:

Option B says Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

So which stars can be detected by both?

Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, option B includes Star3 and Star5, which are both detectable by both spectrographs.

Option D includes Star1 and Star4.

Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

So the correct answer would be that Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, Star1 is also detectable by both, but the options don't include all three.

Looking back, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be seen by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be seen by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about Star3's m. Did I make a mistake?

Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6, A_V=1.86. So is the given m (15.5) the apparent or the intrinsic?

The question states Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5. So that's the observed m, including extinction. So Star3's m is 15.5, so within both limits.

Similarly, Star5's m is 15.0, so both can see it.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (m=15.5), Star3 (m=15.5), and Star5 (m=15.0).

Looking at the options, the only option that includes two of these is option B: Star3 and Star5.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. The key criteria are:

1. **ESPRESSO** can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 17.
2. **HIRES** can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 16.

Thus, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤ 16 to be detectable by both instruments.
