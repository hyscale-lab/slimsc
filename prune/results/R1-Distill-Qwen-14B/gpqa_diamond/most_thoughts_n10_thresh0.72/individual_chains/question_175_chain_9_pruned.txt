Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with its symmetry along the z-axis. The question is about the radiation it emits, particularly the power radiated at a specific angle. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that oscillating charges can radiate electromagnetic waves, and the pattern of this radiation depends on the setup.

So the problem says that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda (the wavelength) and theta (the angle from the z-axis). The maximum power is A, and we're asked to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also the possible form of f.

I think I need to recall how the radiation pattern looks for such a charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal and oscillating, perhaps it's similar to a dipole radiator. Wait, no, a dipole has a specific radiation pattern. Let me think: for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far zone (radiation zone) has a certain dependence on theta.

The power radiated per unit solid angle, I believe, for a dipole, is proportional to (1/(lambda^4)) multiplied by sin^2(theta). Or was it cos^2(theta)? Wait, no, wait. The dipole radiation pattern is maximum along the axis (theta=0 and 180 degrees), and minimum in the plane (theta=90 degrees). So the pattern would have a sin^2(theta) dependence, because when theta is 90, sin is 1, but wait no, that would be maximum at 90. Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is proportional to sin^2(theta), which is maximum at theta = 90 degrees. Right. So the maximum power occurs perpendicular to the dipole's axis.

Wait, but the problem here is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal. Maybe it's more like a quadrupole or something else. Or is it a dipole? I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, the charge distribution is spheroidal, so perhaps the dipole approximation applies.

Alternatively, if it's an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is as I thought. But regardless, when the problem says the maximum power is A, it's probably referring to
