Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is where the positions of the substituents on the double bond get rearranged, right?

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, is 3-methylpent-1-ene chiral? Let me think. The structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. 3-methyl would be substituting on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait, numbering is from the double bond. Oh wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. 3-methyl would be a methyl
