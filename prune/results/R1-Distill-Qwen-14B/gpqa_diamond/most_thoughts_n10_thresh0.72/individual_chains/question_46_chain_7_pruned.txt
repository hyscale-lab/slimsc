Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to wrap my head around Grubbs catalyst and all that olefin metathesis stuff. Let me read the question again: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene?

Hmm. Racemic means it's a mixture of both enantiomers, right? So whatever the structure is, it's present in equal amounts of both mirror images. But wait, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the catalyst breaks and reforms double bonds, swapping the ends. I remember that Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium based, and it's used in ring-closing metathesis and other olefin metatheses.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? No, wait. Wait, pentene is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let's count: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. Wait, no. Wait, pent is five carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, that’s four carbons after the double bond. Wait, maybe I should number it properly.

Wait, pent means five carbons in the chain. So for pent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on the third carbon. So the third carbon is the one next to the double bond. Wait, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? That can’t be because that would be six carbons. Oh wait, no: 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between 1 and 2, and a methyl group on carbon 3. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, but that would require five carbons in total. So
