Okay, I'm trying to solve this genetics problem. Let me read through it again and think through each step.

So, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound by using EMS mutagenesis. They've sequenced some mutants and are looking at the first exon area for changes.

The task is to figure out which mutation would probably eliminate the compound. The options are Mutant 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I remember that the gene structure is exons and introns. Exons are the coding regions, so any mutation in the exons could affect the protein product. Introns are non-coding, but their splicing is important.

Looking at the intact gene sequence:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

And the mutants:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, comparing the first part of the intact gene and Mutant 1. Intact starts with ATGTTTCTC, and Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTAC... Let me compare each position.

Wait, maybe I should look for synonymous vs. nonsynonymous changes. Synonymous mutations don't change the amino acid, so they probably won't affect the protein much. Nonsynonymous would change the amino acid, possibly disrupting the function.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The change is in the first part. Let me line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTA GTC GT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT ... Wait, not sure. Maybe it's better to look at the exact differences.

Looking at the first part:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So, the first part of the sequence.

In the intact gene, the sequence from position 5-12 (maybe) is TTCTCGC. In Mutant1, it's TTCTACG.

Wait, perhaps I should count the letters. Let me index the first few bases.

Intact gene first 20 bases: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT ... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps looking for changes that cause a frameshift or a premature stop codon.

Wait, but the problem says
