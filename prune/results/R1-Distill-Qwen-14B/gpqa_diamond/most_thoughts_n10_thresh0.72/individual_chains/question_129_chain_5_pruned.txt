Okay, so I need to figure out which compound E is based on the reaction steps given. Let's start breaking down each step.

First, the reaction scheme:
1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form D.
4. D loses an inert gas to form E.

And there are two hints provided.

Let me go through each step one by one.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A has a ketone or aldehyde group, HCN would add to it. That suggests A is a carbonyl compound. The product B would then be a cyanohydrin if it's a ketone. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, B would be a cyanohydrin as well, but maybe with a different structure.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation usually reduces triple bonds, double bonds, or other unsaturated bonds. Wait, but B is from HCN addition. So if A is a ketone, B would have an -OH and -CN group on adjacent carbons. But I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is an aldehyde. HCN adds to form a cyanohydrin, which upon hydrogenation (like catalytic hydrogenation) reduces the triple bond (if any) or maybe the double bond in the cyanohydrin.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. HCN adds to a carbonyl group (like ketone or aldehyde) to form a cyanohydrin. So for a ketone, like cyclohexanone, adding HCN would give a structure with an -OH and -CN on adjacent carbons, like (CH2) groups attached.

Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if B has a triple bond, maybe from a nitrile group. Wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but that's with different catalysts, like Raney Ni. Or in presence of H2 and maybe a different catalyst. Wait, Pd is often used for hydrogenation
