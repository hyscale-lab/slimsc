Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom.

Hmm, the problem says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They mention small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, I remember that m can take values like -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. So for small m, maybe m is zero? Or perhaps it's just small in magnitude, like m=1 or something.

The main thing is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment and the external magnetic field. And the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two energy levels in the hydrogen atom, which corresponds to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is the wavelength for the Balmer series, maybe the H-alpha line or something? That's about 486 nm, which is green light.

So I need to find the magnitude of the paramagnetic term and compare it with ΔE.

First, let me think about the paramagnetic coupling. The magnetic dipole interaction energy is given by the Zeeman effect formula. The energy shift is something like ΔE_Zeeman = μ·B. What's μ here? Oh right, the magnetic moment is μ = -g * μ_B * m, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but wait. The paramagnetic coupling term in the Hamiltonian is probably the Zeeman term. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to μ·B. So let's calculate that.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is eħ/(2m_e), where e is the electron charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and m_e is the electron mass. Let me recall the value. I think μ_B is about 9.274×10^-24 J/T. But I might need to double-check the exact value, but I'll proceed with this.

Now, the magnetic field B is 1 T. The quantum number m is small, so let's say m is 1 or 0. Wait, but if m is zero, the energy shift would be zero. So perhaps m isn't zero here; maybe it's non-zero but small. Hmm, but the problem says small m, so m could be ±1, maybe. Let's assume m=1 for calculation purposes.

So the energy shift due to the magnetic field is ΔE_Zeeman = μ * B. Let's plug in the numbers. μ would be g * μ_B * m. Wait, but the direction matters. The energy is proportional to m, so with m=1, the shift is positive.

Wait, but wait. The paramagnetic coupling term is part of the Hamiltonian. The expectation value of H would be the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * g * m * B. But I'm not sure about the exact expression. Let me think again.

The Zeeman effect Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. And μ is related to the spin or orbital angular momentum. Wait, but in this case, since the magnetic field is along Oz, the z-axis, the dot product simplifies to μ_z B. So indeed, the energy shift is proportional to m times some constants times B.

Wait, but for the orbital magnetic moment, the magnetic moment is μ = (e/(2m_e)) * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. And L_z = m * ħ. So μ = (e/(2m_e)) * m * ħ. So the energy shift is H = -μ·B = - (e/(2m_e)) * m * ħ * B. Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is H = -μ·B, which becomes H = -μ_z B = - ( (μ_B m) )
