Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about determining the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. The stars are Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses and elemental abundances. I remember that [X/Y] notation represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to Y relative to the Sun.

So, the given data is:
- Star_1 mass: 1.5 solar masses
- Star_2 mass: 1.2 solar masses
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: which means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: so Mg to Si ratio in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times solar.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: Fe to H ratio in Star_1 is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: Mg to H ratio in Star_2 is same as Sun.

We also have the solar photospheric composition:
- 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The formula is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value. So for Fe in the Sun:
log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Now, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2], or maybe [Si/Star_2] / [Si/Star_1]? Wait, the way the question is phrased: the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2, so n_Si1 /n_Si2.

Wait, no. The problem says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So it's probably n_Si1/n_Si2.

To find that ratio, I think I need to express [Si/H] for both stars and then take the ratio.

But wait, how do we get [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] into [Si/H]?

Hmm. Let's think.

In Star_1:
We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → So [Fe/H]1 = 0 → Fe/H ratio is same as Sun.
And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → which is log(Si/Fe)_star1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

In Star_2:
[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → Mg/Si = 10^0.3 ≈2.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → so Mg/H is same as Sun.

Wait, but we need to find [Si/H] for each star to then get the ratio.

So, let's think about each star.

Starting with Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe/H = solar ratio, which is nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(Si/Fe) =0.3 → Si/Fe =10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So, in Star_1: nSi/nFe =2 → nSi = 2 * nFe.

But since nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH.

So nSi = 2 * (3.16e-5 * nH) = 6.32e-5 * nH.

Thus, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi/nH) = log(6.32e-5) = log(6.32) + log(1e-5) ≈ 0.8 + (-5) = -4.2.

Wait, wait. Wait, let me compute that correctly. 6.32e-5 is 6.32 * 1e-5.

So log(6.32e-5) = log(6.32) + log(1e-5) → log(6.32) is about 0.8, and log(1e-5) is -5. So 0.8 -5 = -4.2.

So [Si/H]_1 is -4.2.

Wait, but wait. Let me reassess. Because in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is zero. So Fe/H is the same as the Sun's. So nFe/nH = 3.16e-5. So nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH.

Then, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe) = 0.3 → nSi = nFe * 10^0.3.

Which is 3.16e-5 *10^0.3 * nH = (3.16e-5 * 2) nH ≈6.32e-5 nH.

So [Si/H]_1 = log(6.32e-5) = log(6.32) + log(1e-5) → log(6.32) is about 0.8, so 0.8 -5 = -4.2. So [Si/H]_1 is -4.2.

Now Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → Mg/Si = 10^0.3 → Mg/Si ≈2.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg/H is same as Sun, which is 1e-5.

So for Star_2, nMg = 1e-5 * nH.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → nMg/nSi =10^0.3 → nMg= 2 * nSi → nSi = nMg / 2.

So nSi = (1e-5 *nH ) / 2 = 5e-6 *nH.

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log(5e-6) → log(5) is ~0.7, so 0.7 -6 = -5.3.

Wait, no. Because 5e-6 is 5 *1e-6 → so log(5e-6) → log(5) ≈0.7, plus log(1e-6)= -6 → total is -5.3.

So [Si/H]_1 is -4.2, [Si/H]_2 is -5.3.

The ratio of [Si] in Star_1 to Star_2 is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) → since nH is in each star's own photosphere, but when we take the ratio, the nH cancels.

So (nSi1 /nH1 ) / (nSi2 /nH2 ) = (nSi1 /nSi2 ) * (nH2 /nH1 )

Wait, but wait... The [X/H] is log(nX/nH). So [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) = log(6.32e-5) = -4.2.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi2/nH2) = log(5e-6) = -5.3.

But to find the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = (nSi1/nSi2) * (nH2/nH1) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure whether the two stars have the same hydrogen density. Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, which would be the ratio (nSi1)/(nSi2).

Wait, but if the stars have different total densities, but in LTE, each element's abundance is determined by their ratios relative to H. Hmm, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual number densities and then take the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the [Si/H] for each star, and then take 10^[ ( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ) ] to get the ratio nSi1/nSi2.

Wait, because [Si/H] is log(nSi/nH), so the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) = 10^[ ( [Si/H]_1 ) - [Si/H]_2 ) ]

But wait, that would be (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

But the ratio we're looking for is nSi1/nSi2. Hmm.

Wait, but nH1 and nH2 might not be the same, so I can't directly say that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the hydrogen density in each star is the same as the Sun's, but I don't think that's necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps since each star has a different mass, but the photospheric composition is considered.

Wait, the EW method determines elemental abundances under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so the problem is about the elemental ratios relative to H.

But maybe I should think in terms of the ratios [Si/H] for each star.

So [Si/H]_1 = -4.2 → nSi1/nH1 = 10^(-4.2) ≈ 6.3e-5.

[Si/H]_2 = -5.3 → nSi2/nH2 = 10^(-5.3) ≈ 5e-6.

But to find nSi1/nSi2, we need to consider how H varies between the two stars.

Wait, but without knowing nH1 and nH2, I can't directly compute nSi1/nSi2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Each star's photosphere has its own H density, but the [X/H] ratios are given relative to each star's H. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe/H is same as Sun, so nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2 = nMg_sun * (nH2 / nH_sun).

Wait, but without knowing the total density of each star, how can I find the ratio of Si?

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars as in the Sun, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only concerned with the ratios within each star's atmosphere, and the ratio of their silicon abundances is based on their [Si/H] values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio.

So for Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = -4.2.

For Star_2: [Si/H]_2 = -5.3.

So the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 } = 10^{ (-4.2) - (-5.3) } = 10^{1.1} ≈ 12.6.

Wait, 10^1.1 is approximately 12.589, which is roughly 12.6. So the ratio would be approximately 12.6.

But wait, does this take into account the hydrogen? Because nH1 and nH2 are the hydrogen densities in each star. But if the stars have different total densities, perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] would adjust for that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of silicon in the two stars is [Si_1/Si_2] = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 → which would be (-4.2) - (-5.3) )=1.1 → 10^1.1≈12.6.

Wait, but let me think again. [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So, for Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) = log( (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) )

So, (nSi1/nH1) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) }

Similarly, for Star_2: (nSi2/nH2) = 10^{ [Si/H]_2 + log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) }

So the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Because the solar terms cancel out.

So, that's 10^{ (-4.2) - (-5.3) } = 10^{1.1} ≈12.6.

Which would give the ratio of (nSi1/nH1) to (nSi2/nH2) as ~12.6. But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres, so nSi1/nSi2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the same as (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) * (nH2/nH1).

Because nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1/nH2) / (nSi2/nH2) ).

Wait, let me write it down:

nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH2) )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

nSi1 = (nSi1/nH1) * nH1

nSi2 = (nSi2/nH2) * nH2

So the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi1/nH1)*nH1 ] / [ (nSi2/nH2)*nH2 ]

Which is (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH1/nH2)

So the ratio depends on the ratio of hydrogen in each star.

But wait, we don't know nH1 and nH2. How can we proceed?

Hmm, this complicates things. Because without knowing the hydrogen densities, we can't find the ratio of silicon atoms. Unless the problem assumes that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars, which may not be the case.

Wait, but perhaps in LTE, the abundances are determined relative to hydrogen, so perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero suggests that the Fe and Mg are at solar ratios relative to H in each star. But without knowing the total H in each star, it's hard to tell. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the ratio of [Si] in the photospheres is the same as the ratio of [Si/H] in each star. Because if H is the same in both, then nSi1/nSi2 = (nSi1/nH)/(nSi2/nH) ) * (nH/nH) ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

But that would only be the case if nH is the same in both stars, which we can't assume.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio of silicon is (nSi1 / nH1) divided by (nSi2 / nH2 ), which is the ratio [Si/H]_1 over [Si/H]_2 in terms of exponents.

Wait, but if we have [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, the ratio of (nSi1 /nH1 ) to (nSi2 /nH2 ) is 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

So, in this case, that's 10^(-4.2 - (-5.3)) ) = 10^(1.1) ≈12.6.

But does this answer correspond to the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres? Or is this a ratio of [Si/H]?

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms, so nSi1/nSi2.

But without knowing the ratio of H, nH1/nH2, we can't find that. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is implying that both stars have the same hydrogen number density. But that's probably not the case, as they're different stars with different masses and possibly different temperatures, densities, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero implies that Fe and Mg are at the same abundance relative to H as in the Sun, but the total H could vary. But without more data, this approach might not work.

Wait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Perhaps I'm supposed to find the ratio of [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], and then use those to find the [Si/H] for each star.

Wait, let me go back.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe/H = solar. So Fe is 3.16e-5 * nH.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → Si/Fe =10^0.3 → that gives Si = Fe *10^0.3.

But since Fe =3.16e-5 *nH, so Si = 3.16e-5 *10^0.3 *nH.

So [Si/H]_1 = log( (3.16e-5 *10^0.3 ) / 1 ) → log(3.16e-5 *2 ) → log(6.32e-5 ) → which is about log(6.32) + log(1e-5) → 0.8 + (-5) → -4.2.

For Star_2:
[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → Mg = Si *10^0.3.

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg = solar ratio =1e-5 *nH.

So 1e-5 *nH = Si *10^0.3 → Si = (1e-5 *nH ) / 10^0.3 → approx (1e-5 / 2 ) *nH → 5e-6 *nH.

So [Si/H]_2 = log(5e-6) → log(5) + log(1e-6) → 0.7 -6 → -5.3.

So the [Si/H] for Star_1 is -4.2, Star_2 is -5.3.

The ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 is 10^(-4.2) / 10^(-5.3) ) = 10^(1.1) ≈12.6.

But that's the ratio of (nSi1/nH1) divided by (nSi2/nH2 ), which is (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nH2) ) / (nSi2/nH2) ) → No, wait that's not correct. Because it's [nSi1/(nH1)] / [nSi2/(nH2) ] = (nSi1 *nH2) / (nSi2 *nH1 )

Which is (nSi1/nSi2) * (nH2/nH1 )

So, I need to find (nSi1/nSi2) = [ (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) ] * (nH1/nH2 )

But without knowing the ratio of nH1 to nH2, I can't proceed. Unless I can find nH1 and nH2 from other data. But I don't see how.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe/H in Star_1 is same as Sun. So Fe in Star_1 is 3.16e-5 *nH1.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg in Star_2 is 1e-5 *nH2.

But without knowing the total density, perhaps I can't find nH1 and nH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of H is the same, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio of H is the same as in the Sun, but that's not stated.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the H variation and just take the ratio of [Si/H] as 10^{ ( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ) } which is 10^1.1≈12.6, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the question gives the [Mg/Si] for Star_2, but I think I've applied that correctly.

Wait, another approach: Compute the actual nSi for each star, assuming that nH is the same in both. Let's see what happens.

Assume nH1 =nH2 =nH.

So nSi1 = 10^(-4.2) *nH.

nSi2 =10^(-5.3) *nH.

So ratio nSi1/nSi2 = 10^(-4.2 +5.3) )=10^1.1≈12.6. So that would be option B.

But why would we assume that nH is the same? Because the problem says to consider LTE and use EW method, but I don't think that justifies assuming the same nH.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is simply testing the understanding of the [X/H] ratios, and the stars' hydrogen can be considered the same, perhaps because the problem doesn't provide other data. So, perhaps the intended answer is ~12.6, which is option B.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance notation [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1:
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: Fe/H is the same as the Sun. From the solar photospheric composition, nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: log(nSi/nFe) = 0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. Thus, nSi = 2 * nFe.
- Substituting nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH, we get nSi = 6.32e-5 * nH.
- **[Si/H]_1 = log(nSi/nH) = log(6.32e-5) ≈ -4.2**.

### Star_2:
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: Mg/H is the same as the Sun. From the solar photospheric composition, nMg/nH = 1e-5.
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: log(nMg/nSi) = 0.3 → nMg/nSi = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. Thus, nSi = nMg / 2.
- Substituting nMg = 1e-5 * nH, we get nSi = 5e-6 * nH.
- **[Si/H]_2 = log(nSi/nH) = log(5e-6) ≈ -5.3**.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2} = 10^{(-4.2) - (-5.3)} = 10^{1.1} \approx 12.6.
\]

This calculation assumes that the hydrogen density ratio cancels out, as the problem does not provide additional information about the total density or hydrogen content of the stars. Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.

Answer: B
