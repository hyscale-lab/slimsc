Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so like 1/plx^5. And I'm supposed to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are different powers of r, like r squared, cubed, etc. So I need to find the relationship between the number of stars and distance.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit as seen from the star. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by the parallax, so d = 1/plx. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since d = 1/plx, I can express plx in terms of d. So plx = 1/d. Substituting that into the equation for N, I get N ∝ (1/( (1/d) ))^5. Let me compute that.

So plugging in plx = 1/d, the equation becomes N ∝ (d)^5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1/(plx) is d, so 1/( (1/d) ) is d. So 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think we're being asked about the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance r with thickness dr. Like, the number of stars in a small range around r.

So if N ∝ r^5, then the number of stars in a shell at radius r would be proportional to r^5. But wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the number density is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is same as d^5, because d is 1/plx. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit muddled here. Let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and since plx is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/d), then 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases as the fifth power.

But wait, the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps the question is asking about the differential, like the number of stars in a small shell between r and r+dr. So if the number of stars up to a distance r is N(r) proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell dr would be dN/dr * dr, which is (5*r^4) dr. So the number per unit distance (like stars per parsec) would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, that's conflicting
