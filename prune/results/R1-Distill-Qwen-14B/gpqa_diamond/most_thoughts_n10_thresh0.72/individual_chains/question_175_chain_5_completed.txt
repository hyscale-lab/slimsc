Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that there's an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. The question is asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of f.

So, first, let me recall what I know about radiation from oscillating charges. I remember that when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic waves, and the power emitted depends on the angle θ relative to the axis of oscillation. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is typically a function of cosθ. Specifically, the radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2, I think.

Wait, no, wait. The dipole radiation pattern is actually proportional to (sinθ)^2, which means it's maximum at θ=90 degrees. Because sin(90) is 1, so the maximum there. So, if the maximum power is A, then at θ=30 degrees, the power would be a fraction of A based on (sinθ)^2.

So, calculating that fraction: sin(30 degrees) is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. That means at θ=30°, the power is 25% of A. So the fraction is 1/4. So looking at the options, the fraction part is either B, C, or D. The options A and D have 1/2 and 3/4 respectively, so they can be eliminated for the fraction part.

Next, the form of f, which is the function for the radiated power per unit solid angle. The function f depends on λ and θ. For dipole radiation, I remember that the intensity (which is power per unit area) varies as the square of the sine of θ, so f(θ) would be proportional to (sinθ)^2.

But wait, the problem says it's a function of λ as well. So I need to think about how the power per unit solid angle depends on λ. From what I remember, the power radiated by an oscillating charge (like in dipole radiation) goes as (acceleration)^2, but when considering the far-field radiation, the dependence on wavelength comes in because the radiation is due to the acceleration varying sinusoidally. 

Wait, but in the radiation zone, the fields are determined by the multipole expansion, and for a dipole, the radiation depends on the second derivative of the charge distribution. The power radiated should depend on the square of the dipole moment's second time derivative, I think. But more importantly, the radiated power per unit solid angle in the far field (radiation zone) for a dipole is proportional to (λ^−4) times (sinθ)^2. Because the power per unit solid angle is the intensity, which for dipole radiation is proportional to (sinθ)^2 and λ^-4. Let me think why.

I remember that the intensity (Poynting vector) for dipole radiation in the far field is given by something like (p'^2 sin^2θ)/(c r^2) * (1/(4πε₀ c)), but when considering the dependence on wavelength, λ is related to frequency. Since the power also depends on the square of the frequency, which is inverse square of wavelength (since λ = c/f, so f = c/λ, so f^2 is c²/λ²).

Wait, let me think about the dependence. The Poynting vector for a dipole is proportional to (ω^4 p_0^2 sin^2θ)/(c^3 r^2). Since ω is 2πf, and f is c/λ, so ω is proportional to c/λ. So ω^4 would be proportional to c^4/λ^4. And 1/c^3 from the expression, so overall the intensity would be proportional to (1/λ^4) * (sinθ)^2. So yes, the function f(θ) would be proportional to (sinθ)^2 / λ^4.

Wait, but the problem states that the power per unit solid angle is a function f(λ, θ), so f would have terms in λ and θ. So putting it all together, f should be proportional to (sinθ)^2 multiplied by (1/λ^4). So f is proportional to (sinθ)^2 * λ^{-4}.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible forms of f are given as λ^(-4), λ^(-3), etc. So the function f would be proportional to λ^(-4) times (sinθ)^2. But the way the question is phrased, it says the possible form of f is among the options. So the options are giving the dependence on λ, not necessarily the whole function.

Wait, the question says "a possible form of f are, respectively," so perhaps for each option, the first part is the fraction A, and the second part is the dependence on λ.

So in the options, the second part is for f. So f could be proportional to λ^(-4), etc.

Earlier, I thought that the fraction at θ=30 degrees is 1/4, so the options that have 1/4 are B and C. Between options B and C, the function f is either λ^(-3) or λ^(-4). According to my earlier reasoning, the function f has a λ^(-4) dependence. So the correct option would have 1/4 as the fraction and λ^(-4) as the form of f. Looking back at the options, option C says 1/4 and λ^(-4). So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way: when a charge oscillates, the dipole moment varies sinusoidally, and the radiated power is proportional to the square of the second derivative of the dipole moment. The second derivative would involve the square of the frequency, so f^2. Since frequency f is c/lambda, the power would be proportional to (c^2/lambda^2)^2 = c^4/lambda^4. But power per unit solid angle would also be divided by something, perhaps. But the overall dependence is lambda^-4, as earlier.

So the function f would be proportional to (sinθ)^2 * (1/lambda^4). So the form given in the options is the dependence on lambda, which is lambda^(-4). So the function f is proportional to lambda^(-4), so the correct option is C, which has 1/4 as the fraction and lambda^(-4) as the form.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength \( \lambda \). The radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), and the maximum power is \( A \). The goal is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the possible form of \( f \).

For dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle in the far field depends on \( \theta \) and \( \lambda \). The radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to \( (\sin\theta)^2 \), which means the power is maximum at \( \theta = 90^\circ \) and decreases as \( \theta \) approaches \( 0^\circ \) or \( 180^\circ \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \), so the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at this angle is:

\[
\left(\sin 30^\circ\right)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \, \text{or} \, \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Next, the functional form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) is considered. In the far field, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) for dipole radiation is proportional to \( (\sin\theta)^2 \) and inversely proportional to \( \lambda^4 \). This arises because the radiated power depends on the square of the frequency, and \( \lambda \) is inversely proportional to the frequency. Thus, \( f(\lambda, \theta) \propto (\sin\theta)^2 \cdot \lambda^{-4} \), meaning the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).

From the options provided:
- Option A has a fraction of \( \frac{1}{2} \), which is incorrect.
- Option B has a fraction of \( \frac{1}{4} \) but an incorrect \( \lambda^{-3} \) dependence.
- Option C has a fraction of \( \frac{1}{4} \) and the correct \( \lambda^{-4} \) dependence.
- Option D has a fraction of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, which matches both the fraction of the maximum power and the functional dependence on \( \lambda \).

Answer: C
