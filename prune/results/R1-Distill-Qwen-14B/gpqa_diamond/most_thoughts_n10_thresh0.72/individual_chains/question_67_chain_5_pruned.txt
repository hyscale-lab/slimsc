Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think it through.

Okay, the question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l equal to 1. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, which I think means that the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the magnetic quantum number m is -1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each. So, what's the probability that both electrons have their Lz as -ħ?

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with angular momentum coupling, we use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Each state is a combination of the product states of the individual angular momenta. The given state is |l1, l2, l, m> which is |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, but each electron's orbital angular momentum is in a p orbital, so each has l=1. When you couple two angular momenta l1 and l2, the possible total angular momentum l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Here, 1 and 1 can combine to l=0,1, or 2. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is one of the possible coupled states.

I think the state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states |m1, m2>, where m1 is the z-component of the first electron's angular momentum, and m2 is the same for the second. But wait, since the total m is m1 + m2, in this case, it's -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs must add to -1.

Wait, but the problem is about the joint probability of m1 = -ħ and m2 = -ħ. So m1 = -1 (since it's in units of ħ), m2 = -1. So m1 + m2 = -2. But the total m in the state is -1. So this particular combination (m1 = -1, m2 = -1) would give m = -2, which doesn't match the given state's m of -1. So that combination doesn't contribute to the state |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, but wait. The state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. So any product state |m1, m2> in the expansion must have m1 + m2 = -1. So the pair (m1=-1, m2=0) would sum to -1, as would (0,-1), (1,-2) but wait, since l can't exceed l1 and l2. Wait, each m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly for m2. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to m=-1 would be:

m1 = +1, m2 = -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So that's invalid.

Wait, m1 can be from -1 to +1. So possible pairs:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum to -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum to -1.

m1=+1, m2=-2 → impossible because m2 can't be -2.

Also, if m1= -2? No, m1 can't be less than -1.

So the only possible product states that contribute to the state |1,1,2,-1> are those with (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Because these are the only pairs that sum to m=-1 without violating the individual m1 and m2 ranges.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but how do we find the coefficients for each of these product states in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1>?

I think that's where the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m.

In this case, the state |1,1,2,-1> is expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1
