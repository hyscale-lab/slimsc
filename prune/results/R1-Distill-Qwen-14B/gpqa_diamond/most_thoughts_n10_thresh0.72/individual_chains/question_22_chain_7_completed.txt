Okay, so I've got this question about electrochemistry, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about the oxidizing properties of oxygen in different solutions. The statement is incomplete, and I need to fill in the blanks with the right terms. The options are A to D, each with different combinations of 'weaker/stronger' and 'faster/slower'.

First, I'll try to remember some basic electrochemistry concepts. I think it has to do with the strength of oxidizing agents and reaction rates in different pH conditions.

So, the first part says, "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a … oxidant in basic solutions." Thermodynamically refers to the spontaneity or tendency of a reaction, which relates to the cell potential (E°). A stronger oxidizing agent has a higher tendency to gain electrons, meaning a higher E°. In basic solutions, I recall that the concentration of H+ ions is lower because OH- is higher. 

Wait, the reaction involving oxygen as an oxidant is probably the oxygen reduction reaction. Let me think about the standard reduction potentials. In acidic solution, the oxygen reduction is more favorable because H+ is available. The relevant half-reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, which has a standard E° around +1.23 V. 

But in basic solution, the same reaction would adjust because H+ isn't as available. The same reaction in basic conditions would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-, with a standard E° of about +0.40 V. So the E° is lower in basic solution, meaning the oxidizing power is weaker. Wait, but wait: the oxidizing strength is determined by the E°. A higher E° means a stronger oxidizing agent. So in basic solution, oxygen has a lower E°, so it's a weaker oxidant compared to acidic conditions. So the first blank should be 'weaker' in basic solutions.

Now the second part: "Kinetically, oxygen reacts … in acidic solutions." Kinetics refers to the rate of reaction. So in acidic conditions, how does the reaction rate compare to basic?

I think that the reaction rate depends on the concentration of H+ ions because the reaction involves H+ in the mechanism. For the O2 reduction, in acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O. The presence of H+ ions would speed up the reaction because they are involved in the electron transfer steps. So in acidic solutions, the reaction would be faster.

Putting it all together: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions, and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions. Now looking at the options:

Option A: stronger – faster → No, because first part is weaker.
Option B: stronger – slower → No.
Option C: weaker – faster → Yes! That matches.
Option D: weaker – slower → No.

So the correct combination is weaker and faster, which is option C.


Thermodynamically, the oxidizing power of oxygen depends on the solution's pH. In acidic solutions, the reduction reaction of oxygen involves H⁺ ions (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O), which has a higher standard reduction potential (+1.23 V) compared to the same reaction in basic solutions (O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with a standard reduction potential of +0.40 V). This means oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions and a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

Kinetically, the reaction rate depends on the availability of H⁺ ions. In acidic solutions, the presence of H⁺ ions facilitates the electron transfer steps, making the reaction faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, the absence of H⁺ ions slows down the reaction.

Thus, thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions, and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions. The correct combination is **weaker – faster**, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
