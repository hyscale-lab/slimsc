Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they've built a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 Earth years. They're sending an astronaut who's 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes for him to reach Earth from their perspective. Wait, no, waitâ€”no, the question is from the astronaut's point of view. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says, "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?" Oh right, so we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

So, I remember that when dealing with such high speeds, we have to consider special relativity, specifically time dilation. Oh right, time dilation occurs because at speeds approaching the speed of light, time for the moving observer (the astronaut) will appear to slow down relative to a stationary observer (like someone on Earth or an observer in the LMC).

But wait, the astronaut is the one moving, so their own time (proper time) will be less than the time measured by someone else. So the key here is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

First, I think I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, but the problem doesn't provide that. Oh, wait, maybe it's implied by the average lifetime and the speed? Or perhaps it's a standard problem where the distance is probably the same as the galaxy's distance.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is using the speed and the average lifetime of the aliens to determine how much time passes for the astronaut. Because, if the astronaut is traveling at 0.99999987c, the time experienced by him would be less than the time observed from Earth.

But wait, the problem says the average lifetime of the aliens is 150 solar years. So if an astronaut is 22 years old, maybe their lifespan from the Earth's perspective is 150 years. But since the astronaut is moving at such a high speed,
