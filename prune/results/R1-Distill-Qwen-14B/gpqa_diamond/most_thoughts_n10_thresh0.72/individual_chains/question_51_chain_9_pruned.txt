Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through. The problem is about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this.

Alright, the setup: there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of this system.

Wait, right. When you have a charge near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But since the sphere is grounded, it's connected to the earth, so any induced charges can flow in or out.

So, the conducting sphere being grounded means that its potential is zero. But how does that affect the charge distribution?

I remember that when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same everywhere. Since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would leave, and the potential will be zero.

Wait, but the sphere is neutral to start with, I think. Because it's conducting, so charges move freely. Induced charges would be on the surface.

So, the charge q placed outside the sphere (since d is the distance from the center, and I think d is greater than R because if it were inside, the sphere's radius might complicate things more) would induce opposite charges on the sphere's surface.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says 'd distance away from the center'â€”so if d is greater than R, the charge is outside;
