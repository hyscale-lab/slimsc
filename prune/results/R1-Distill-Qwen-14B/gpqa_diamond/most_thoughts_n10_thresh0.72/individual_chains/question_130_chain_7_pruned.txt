Okay, so I've got this question here about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, Lyman alpha absorption... Oh right, that's part of the Lyman series in hydrogen. The Lyman alpha line is the transition from n=2 to n=1, which emits light at about 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm, so it's in the far ultraviolet range). 

But in this case, the hydrogen clouds are absorbing light from quasars. So when the quasar's light passes through these clouds, the hydrogen absorbs at 1216 Angstroms, but because of the expansion of the universe, this wavelength is redshifted. 

So the observed wavelength (λ_observed) is longer than 1216 Angstroms if the cloud is moving away, right? Because redshift stretches the wavelength. The formula for redshift (z) is z = (λ_obs - λ_emit)/λ_emit. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z).

But wait, the question is about the lower limit for the redshift. So what's the maximum redshift that can still be detected by optical telescopes? Because optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light, especially not from the ground. The atmosphere blocks a lot of UV, so ground-based telescopes can't observe certain wavelengths.

So the Lyman alpha line at rest is 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is in the far UV. If the cloud is at a certain redshift, the observed wavelength would be in the optical range, which is longer than about 400 nm (violet) to around 700 nm (red). 

Wait, but ground-based optical telescopes can't see below about 300 nm or so, because the atmosphere (ozone layer, etc.) blocks that
