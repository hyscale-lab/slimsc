Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me see what the question says.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

So, the task is to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. And during this calculation, which statement among the options A to D is correct.

Let me start by writing down the given matrix S. Since the first row is 0 and -i, and the second is i and 0, so S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, Ay is c times S. So, substituting c = h/(4π), Ay becomes:

[ 0          -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0         ]

Wait, but I think I should write it more clearly. Maybe as fractions. Let me compute that. So each element of Ay is c multiplied by the corresponding element of S.

So, let's compute each element:

Top-left: 0 * c = 0
Top-right: (-i) * c = (-i)(h/(4π))
Bottom-left: i * c = i*(h/(4π))
Bottom-right: 0 * c = 0

So Ay matrix is:

[ 0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  0       ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a       ]

The determinant of this matrix is ( -a )( -a ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

Compute that: determinant = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, the product of the off-diagonal terms is (-i)(i) multiplied by (h/(4π))². Let me compute that. (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. Because i squared is -1. So (-i)(i) = -i² = 1. So the product is (1)*(h²)/(16 π²).

So the determinant becomes a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but wait a second. Because the determinant equation is a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ] = 0. So a = ± (h/(4π)) * something? No, wait: h/(4π) squared is h²/(16 π²). So yes,
