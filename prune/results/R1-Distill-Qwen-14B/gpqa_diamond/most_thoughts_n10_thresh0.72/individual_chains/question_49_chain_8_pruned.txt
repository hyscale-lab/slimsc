Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. I need to match each product with the options provided.

Starting with Reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. Hmm. Wait, so what's the structure of 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine? Let me draw it out. It's (CH3O)2C-NH2. Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Oh wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would be (CH3O)2CHNH2? Maybe.

But wait, the reaction is with but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH2C(OH)=CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CH-OH with a double bond at position 3. Wait
