Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it says.

The problem involves an electron in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I think that means they're the standard basis states for spin-1/2 particles, like |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

First, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me think about that matrix.

For a 2x2 system (since we're dealing with up and down states), the matrix would look like this:
A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Wait, no. Wait, if the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonals are hbar/2. So A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Oh, but wait, in a 2x2 system, i and j go from 1 to 2. So for i=1, j=2: A_12 = hbar/2, A_21 = hbar/2. And A_11 and A_22 are zero.

Wait, but for a 2x2 matrix, this would make A look like:
[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

So this operator is anti-diagonal, with the non-zero elements in the off-diagonal. What does that operator represent? Oh, wait, that looks a lot like the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So this operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x. Because sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. Those are the states |+x⟩ and |-x⟩. The eigenvalues for sigma_x are +1 and -1, so for A, the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), so hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator A. So we need to find the probabilities of |alpha> being in each of those eigenstates.

So the plan is:

1. Normalize |alpha>.
2. Express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A (which are |+x> and |-x>).
3. The coefficients will give the probabilities when squared.
4. Then find the average value of operator A.

Alternatively, since the operator A is hbar/2 times sigma_x, the expectation value would be (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha>.

Wait, that's an easier way. Because operator A is (hbar/2
