Okay, so I need to figure out this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about six different substances undergoing an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Each will form a monobromo derivative, and I have to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, electrophilic substitution on benzene rings. The substituents on the ring will direct the incoming electrophile to either the ortho, meta, or para positions. Also, activating groups increase the reaction rate, while deactivating groups decrease it.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, I need to determine how much para product is formed compared to the others. The more activating and ortho/para-directing the group is, the higher the para yield.

Let me list all the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3 â†’ methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group (electron donating through sigma bonds), and it's ortho/para-directing. So the incoming Br will add more to para and ortho positions. But in a monobromination, what's the major product? I think for mono-bromination, the para is major. Wait, no, wait, for methyl group, it's ortho/para, but the major product is para because the para is more stable? Or because more substituted? Wait, I remember that when the substituent is activating, the para product is major when the substituent is meta, but no, for methyl, it's ortho/para. Wait, no, for substituents that are ortho/para-directing, like methyl, the major product tends to be the para because of steric hindrance in the ortho position? Or maybe it's a balance between para and ortho, and for strong activating groups, like -OCH3, the para is major.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the directing effect. Let me think about each substituent.

1) Methyl (CH3): ortho/para, activating. So it will lead to more para substitution, right? Or maybe the para is major when the substituent is in a certain position.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me
