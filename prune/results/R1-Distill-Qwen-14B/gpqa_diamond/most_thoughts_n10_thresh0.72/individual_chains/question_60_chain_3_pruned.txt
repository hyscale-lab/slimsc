Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

Alright, so there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens live for about 150 solar years on average. They want to come to Earth, and their astronaut is 22 years old. The question is, from the astronaut's perspective, how long will the trip take? And the options are whether he'll die before reaching, or how many years it'll take.

Hmm, wait. So the key here is to consider the effects of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Because when you're moving at such a high speed, time slows down for the traveler compared to the stationary observer.

But wait, the question is from the astronaut's point of view. So in their frame of reference, the trip should take less time, right? Because in their frame, they're stationary, and the Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud are moving towards them at a high speed.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, right? So the distance between Earth and the LMC is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Wait, no, more like 160,000 light-years, because the Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million ly away. So LMC is much closer, about 160,000 ly.

So the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. That's super close to the speed of light. Let me calculate the time from Earth's perspective. From Earth, the time to reach would be distance divided by speed. So if the distance is D, the time t_earth = D / (0.99999987c). Let's approximate.

Wait, but if D is around 160,000 light-years, then t_earth would be 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000.00208 years. Wait, but that's a huge number. But wait, the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes 160,000 years from Earth's perspective, then the astronaut wouldn't live long enough, right? But that's not considering relativity.

Wait, but that's from Earth's frame. The astronaut's frame is different. From their perspective, Earth and the LMC are moving towards them at that high speed. So the distance is contracted. So the distance D' that the astronaut measures is D multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma, but wait, actually, in their frame, the distance is shorter. Wait, Lorentz contraction applies to the direction of motion. So the contracted length is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (Earth's frame).

Wait, so the astronaut would think that the distance to Earth is contracted. So the time they experience is t' = D' / v. Let's compute that.

First, compute gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987c.

Let me compute v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute that. 0.99999987 squared.

Let me think: 0.99999987 is very close to 1. So let me compute (1 - x)^2 where x is 0.00000013. Wait, 1 - 0.00000013 is 0.99999987, right?

Wait, 1 - 0.00000013 is 0.99999987? Wait, no, 1 minus 0.00000013 is 0.99999987. So (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x for small x. So x is 0.00000013, so (v²/c²) ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00000013) = 1 - 0.00000026 = 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

Then sqrt(1 - v²
