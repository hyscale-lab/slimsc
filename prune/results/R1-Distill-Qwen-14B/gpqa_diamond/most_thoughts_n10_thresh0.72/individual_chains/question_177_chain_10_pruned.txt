Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, I'm not sure if the mass comes into play here. Hmm, the problem then mentions spectroscopy determining the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, and those are the same. Oh, right, that's about the peak wavelength emission.

Also, their radial velocities are given: Star_1 is at 0 km/s and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Interesting, but I'm not sure how that ties in yet. The astronomers assumed the stars radiate as black bodies and computed the luminosity difference. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

So, the options are A to D with values around 2.2 to 2.35. Hmm, so I think I need to use the black body radiation formula here. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. That should relate to their temperatures, right? Because the peak wavelength λ_max for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if the λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait! If Star_1 and Star_2 have the same λ_max, then their temperatures are the same. But how does that fit with their velocities? Oh, wait, the radial velocity is given. Oh, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So Star_2 is moving towards or away from us at 700 km/s. But when we observe the star's spectrum, the shift in wavelength (redshift or blueshift) affects the observed λ_max.

Wait, so I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The actual emission from the star has a peak at λ_max determined by their temperature. But due to the star's motion, we observe this peak shifted. So the observed λ_max would be different from the intrinsic λ_max.

But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. That means that after accounting for the Doppler shift, both stars appear to have the same peak wavelength. So their intrinsic temperatures might not be the same, because their velocities could cause the observed λ_max to be the same.

Wait, okay. Let me model this. Let's denote:

For Star_1: observed λ_max1 = λ_max (same as Star_2's observed λ_max)
For Star_2: observed λ_max2 = λ_max

But since Star_1's radial velocity is zero, its observed λ_max is the same as its intrinsic λ_max. So, λ_max1_observed = λ_max1_intrinsic.

But Star_2 has a radial velocity v. If it's moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted); if moving away, longer (redshifted). The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_intrinsic * (1 + v_r / c)

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me recall. The relativistic Doppler effect formula is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the approximation when v is much less
