Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slowly.

The question is about some reactions involving mixtures of liquids and their products. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem says that mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has double bonds because alkenes react with bromine (Br2) and cause the solution to decolorize. So, the two liquids in X must each have at least one double bond.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) when heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Disproportionation reactions are common in redox reactions where the same element is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2, but that's not directly relevant here.

Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that do not decolorize bromine water. So Y's components don't have double bonds, or if they do, they aren't conjugated. Wait, but the problem states that the original mixture X has no conjugated multiple bonds. Hmm, that's an important point.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. Let's calculate what that means. The percentage of hydrogen by mass can help determine the molecular formula.

Also, Z is a constituent of Y and is a widely used solvent. Common solvents include things like toluene, xylene, chloroform, etc., but since Z is a hydrocarbon, maybe toluene or something similar. Wait, toluene is C6H5CH3. But let's see.

Wait, Z is a constituent of Y. So Y must consist of two substances, one of which is Z. But when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. Hmm. Wait, when X is hydrogenated, both components of X are hydrogenated to give Z. Or perhaps each component of X is hydrogenated to give Z. Because when hydrogenated, both X and Y give Z.

Wait, the problem states: Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z. So X and Y, when hydrogenated, each produce Z. So each component of X must hydrogenate to Z, and each component of Y must hydrogenate to Z as well.

But wait, Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction. So X has two substances, A and B. They react via a disproportionation, perhaps each A and B undergo some change. But the result is Y, which has two other substances, perhaps one of which is Z.

Wait, let me try to outline the possibilities.

X is a mixture of two alkenes. Because they decolorize bromine, so they have double bonds. When treated with Pt and heat, perhaps they undergo some addition reaction or perhaps a hydrogenation? Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt
