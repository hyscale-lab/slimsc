Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? So the more distant a star is, the smaller its parallax.

Wait, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. Oh right, because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So if a star is closer (smaller d), plx is larger. If it's farther, plx is smaller.

Now, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed. So the number density is the same everywhere. But we need to relate the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let's think in terms of volume, because the number of stars depends on the volume of space.

Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume. So if I can express the volume in terms of parallax, that might help.

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d. So d = 1/plx. I need to consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of a shell is 4πd² * dd, right? Because it's the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness.

But wait, I'm looking at the number of stars per unit parallax, so let me express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, dd = - (1/(d²)) dplx. Oh wait, because plx is inversely proportional to d, so when plx increases, d decreases. Maybe I should substitute d in terms of plx.

So d = 1/plx, so dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since we're dealing with absolute numbers, the negative sign might not matter here. Let me think: if plx increases by dplx, then d decreases by (d^2) dplx. Hmm, perhaps I should express the volume in terms of plx.

The volume of a shell at plx with thickness dplx would be 4πd² * dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/(plx²)) * dplx (
