Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄σ_mu_nu ψ F^{mu_nu}, and σ_{mu_nu} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. The question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Hmm, I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of a parameter (like κ here) determines whether the theory is renormalizable. If the dimension is positive (like 1 or higher), the theory is renormalizable. If it's negative, you need an infinite number of counterterms, so it's not renormalizable. So the first step is to find [κ]_M.

Wait, I need to find the mass dimension of the Lagrangian term. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because in four spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless (since it's integrated over d^4x, which has dimension -4 in mass units). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Okay, so let's break down L_int. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{mu nu}, then ψ, then F^{mu nu}.

I know the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the field strength tensor F has dimension 2 (since F is built from derivatives of the gauge field, which is dimension 1, and derivatives have dimension 1, so F is [∂A] which is 1+1=2? Wait, wait. Let me think again. The gauge field A_mu has dimension 1 because the field strength F_{mu nu} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the field A has dimension 1 because when you have the kinetic term for a vector field, it's something like (∂A)^2. Each ∂ is d/dx, which is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1. So (∂A) is dimension 2, and squared gives 4. So the term (∂A)^2 is part of the Lagrangian, which has dimension 4. So A has dimension 1, and F, being derivatives of A, also has dimension 2.

Wait, but in this problem, the F is F^{mu nu}, which is part of the term. So each F has dimension 2.

Now, what about ψ? The Dirac field ψ has dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac Lagrangian is something like i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. i ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ: ψ̄ is same as ψ, so dimension 3/2 each. ∂ is dimension 1. So 3/2
