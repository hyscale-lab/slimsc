Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. From what I remember, luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. I think the basic formula for luminosity of a star when considering it as a black body is something like L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh right, and 4π comes from the surface area of a sphere.

So the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, their masses are in the same ratio; Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. But wait, I'm not sure if mass directly affects luminosity here. Oh wait, but the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so maybe mass isn't directly needed here except perhaps through other factors. Or maybe it's a red herring.

The next part says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, the peak wavelength. I remember Wien's Law here, which states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1_max = λ2_max implies T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if their masses and radii are different, wouldn't that affect their temperatures? Or maybe not, because the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. So I'll take that as given: T1 = T2.

So then, using the luminosity formula: L is proportional to R² T^4. Since T is the same for both, L would be proportional to R squared. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. But wait, let me think again because I might be missing something.

Wait, the problem also gives radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, how does that factor in? Oh, because when stars are moving, their light shifts in wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But in the problem statement, the peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both. But without considering their velocities, their intrinsic λ_max would be different if their temperatures are different. Oh, but earlier I thought the temperatures are same because λ_max is same. Hmm, maybe I need to correct that.

Wait, let me think again.
