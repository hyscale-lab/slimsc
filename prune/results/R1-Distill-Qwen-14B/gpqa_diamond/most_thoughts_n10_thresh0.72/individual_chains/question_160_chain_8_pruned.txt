Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let's see. The question says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon with all apothems of length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining vertically onto it, and we're to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So for a circular aperture, I remember that the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot with minima at certain angles.

The formula for the minima in a single-slit diffraction is given by a sinθ = mλ/2, where m is an integer (m=1,2,3...) and a is the slit width. Wait, but in this case, the aperture is a polygon with apothem 'a'. Oh, wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius (which would be the distance from the center to a vertex) as a = R cos(π/N), but when N is very large, R ≈ a, right? Because for a polygon with many sides, the apothem is almost equal to the radius.

But wait, for a circular aperture, the radius is R. But in the problem, the apothem is given as 'a'. So I think that for the polygon, as N approaches infinity, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius 'R' of the circular aperture, because the apothem is R cos(π/N), and as N→∞, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) approaches 1. So R ≈ a.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a regular polygon, the apothem is a = R * cos(π/N). So when N is large, a ≈ R*(1 - (π²)/(2N²)) ). But when N is very large, a is approximately R. So for the circular case, the radius R is a, because N approaches infinity, so R ≈ a. So the circular aperture has radius a.

Now, a circular aperture's diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer diffraction
