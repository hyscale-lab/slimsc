Okay, so I'm faced with this physics problem about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of these gamma-rays is limited by the process gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with photon-photon interactions and their cross-sections.

Let me think. The CMB is a bath of low-energy photons, right? The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. So, if a high-energy gamma-ray comes along, it can annihilate with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair. This process is probably relevant for high-energy astrophysical particles, like gamma-rays from distant sources, because they have to travel through this sea of photons.

The lifetime of these gamma-rays would be limited by the time it takes for them to annihilate. So, the mean lifetime would be determined by the inverse of the annihilation rate. The annihilation rate depends on the cross-section and the density of the target photons (CMB photons in this case).

The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs has a certain energy dependence. I think the cross-section sigma scales with the square of the logarithm of the photon energy ratio. Or wait, maybe it's a function that peaks at a certain energy. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Oh right, the cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 is proportional to (E1 E2)^2 / m_e^4, but only when E1 and E2 are much larger than the electron mass. Wait, but the CMB photons are much lower energy.

Wait, no, the cross-section for photon-photon to electron-positron pair production is given by sigma(E1, E2) ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * ln(E1/(m_e c^2)) ln(E2/(m_e c^2)) ), where α is the fine-structure constant, and E1 and E2 are the photon energies. Hmm, I think I remember that.

So, for the case where E1 is the gamma-ray energy and E2 is the CMB photon energy (~1e-3 eV), the cross-section would depend on both. But since E2 is so small compared to E1 (assuming the gamma-rays are high energy), perhaps we can approximate the cross-section sigma as proportional to (E1^2) or some function of E1.

But wait, the CMB photon energy is much smaller than the gamma-ray energy. So E2 is about 1e-3 eV, and E1 is much larger. So the logarithm of E2 would be ln(1e-3 eV / m_e c^2). Let me calculate that. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, which is 5.11e5 eV. So E2/(m_e c^2) is (1e-3)/(5.11e5) ≈ 1.95e-9. So ln(1.95e-9) is a large negative number, but since we're taking the absolute value, perhaps it's about ln(1e9) which is ~20. So ln(E2/(m_e c^2)) ≈ ln(1e-3 / 0.511e6) ≈ ln(1.95e-9) ≈ -20.5, but the cross-section uses the square of the logarithm, but wait, wait, I think the cross-section is more accurately given by a function that depends on the product of the logarithms of E1 and E2 over the electron mass.

Wait, maybe I should think about the typical cross-section formula for photon-photon pair production. The cross-section is proportional to (alpha^2/(m_e^2)) * [ln(E1/m_e c^2) * ln(E2/m_e c^2)] multiplied by some factors, perhaps.

Assuming E1 >> E2, but E2 is fixed at 1e-3 eV. So E1 is the gamma-ray energy.

The cross-section sigma would then depend on ln(E1/m_e c^2) times ln(E2/m_e c^2). Since E2 is fixed, ln(E2/m_e c^2) is a constant. So sigma scales with ln(E1) (since E1 is much bigger than m_e c^2).

But wait, what's the exact expression? The cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 is given by:

sigma = (8π/3) * (α²/(m_e² c^4)) * (E1 E2)/(m_e² c^4) ) * [ln( (E1 + E2)/(2 m_e c²) ) - 1]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into pairs is approximately:
