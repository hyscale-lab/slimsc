Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. Right, when heated or exposed to light, they undergo a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, moving the double bonds. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the specifics.

The problem has two parts. Let's tackle them one by one.

First part: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So benzene ring with an oxygen connected to a CH2 group. The oxygen is attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-something? Wait, butenyl is four carbons. Let me break it down: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, because it's 1-yl, so the substituent is on the first carbon. So structure would be:

The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy attached to a methyl group attached to benzene. So the group is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, the main chain is butenyl. So 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is:

Position 1: CH2-O-
Position 2: CH2 (butenyl, so double bond between 2 and 3)
Wait, but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as:

The group is -(CH2)CH2-O- attached to the benzene. Wait, maybe better to write it as:

The benzene has a substituent: OCH2CH2CH(CH3)-?

Wait, no. Wait, the group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So it's OCH2CH2CH(CH3)CH
