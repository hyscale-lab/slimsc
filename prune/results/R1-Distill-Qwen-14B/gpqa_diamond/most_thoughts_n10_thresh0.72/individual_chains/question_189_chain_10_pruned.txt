Okay, so I've got this physics question here about particles and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which of the options is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

From what I remember, spontaneous symmetry breaking happens when the underlying laws have a certain symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry. So, like how a spinning top can fall over in any direction, but the laws are symmetric around the axis, but once it falls, the symmetry is broken.

Wait, particles associated with broken symmetry are called Goldstone bosons. Goldstone's theorem says that for every continuous symmetry that's broken, there's a corresponding massless boson. But these bosons can become massive if the symmetry is broken spontaneously in a particular way, like in the Higgs mechanism.

Let me go through each option:

A) Phonon: Phonons are quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice. They arise due to the vibrations of atoms in the lattice. I think phonons are related to broken translational symmetry. Because in a solid, the translational symmetry is broken (since atoms are at fixed positions), so the phonons are the Goldstone bosons for that broken symmetry. So phonons are associated with broken symmetry.

B) Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons in certain magnetic materials. I'm not exactly sure about their relation to symmetry breaking. Wait, Skyrmions are solutions in theories with certain symmetries, and they can be associated with chiral symmetry in pion physics. Or maybe they arise from a broken symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps they are more about the structure of the vacuum in a theory with broken symmetry. I'm a bit hazy here.

C) Magnon: Magnons are the quanta of spin waves in a magnet. They're related to the broken translational symmetry too, similar to phonons. In a solid with a magnetic structure, the continuous rotational symmetry of the spins might be broken, leading to magnons as the Goldstone bosons. So magnons are linked to symmetry breaking.

D) Pion: Pions are pseudoscalar mesons, made of up and down quarks. They are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. Chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously in the vacuum of QCD, so pions are the associated particles. But wait, because of confinement and other effects, the pions are actually massless in the symmetry breaking scenario but gain a small mass due to electromagnetic interactions. So pions are tied to broken symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about which particle is NOT associated with broken symmetry. So which one doesn't come from a spontaneous symmetry breaking?

Phonon, magnon, and pion all are Goldstone bosons of broken symmetries. Skyrmion... I'm not so sure. Skyrmions are more about a different kind of structure. They are solutions to the equations of motion in a theory with certain symmetries, like in the Skyrme model. The Skyrme model is used to describe nuclear matter, and Skyrmions represent stable configurations that can carry baryon number. Do they arise from a broken symmetry?
