Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. That's (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 double bonds equivalent) plus maybe an amide or ester group, which could account for the remaining rings or double bonds.

Now looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an amide or ester. Let me think: Amide I bands are typically around 1650-1700, but esters are higher, around 1720-1750. So maybe it's an ester.

Then the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H). That's a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group, such as an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, 2H. That could be an NH2 group, but I'm not sure. Or maybe an OCH2?

4.5 ppm (q, 2H). Quadruplet, 2H. The q stands for quartet, so that's next to a CH2 with two protons. Like the neighboring group is a CH2CH3. So this could be an OCH2CH3 or another structure. Wait, but in an ester, the OCH2CH3 would be split into a quartet, but maybe at a higher chemical shift. Wait, the ethoxy group in an ester usually is around 1.2-1.4 ppm for the triplet (CH2CH3), and the OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.3 ppm as a quartet.

Wait, but the question's NMR shows 4.0 as a broad singlet, and 4.5 as a quartet. Hmm. Let me think.

At 4.5 ppm, the quartet (2H) could be part of an ester group. Let's say it's OCH2, but that's adjacent to another CH2. Wait, perhaps it's -OCH2CO- something. Alternatively, maybe it's part of an amide. Or maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen.

Another thought: The 4.5 ppm quartet with 2H might be part of a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom like O or N. For example, in an ester, the OCH2CO- would have the OCH2 as a quartet.

Wait, let me think about the quartet at 4.5. If the neighboring group is CH2CH3, then this would be a quartet, as each proton is split by the neighboring group's three protons. Wait, no, wait: a quartet typically arises from a neighboring group with three protons, like a CH2CH3. Because each proton here would split into n+1, so 3 neighboring protons would make a quartet. So for example, the OCH2 in an ester group (like ethyl ester) would be split by the adjacent CH2CH3, leading to a quartet.

But in the given NMR, at 4.5 ppm, it's a quartet (2H). So that fits with an OCH2 group attached to an ethyl group. Then, the triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H) would be the CH2CH3.

Wait, but then the OCH2 would be at around 4.1-4.3 ppm, depending on the substituents. So 4.5 is higher than I would expect. Hmm. Maybe it's an amide group. Or perhaps it's an ester but with more deshielding, like adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.

Alternatively, perhaps this quartet is part of a benzamide structure.
