Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when we talk about the excitation of atoms in stars, it's related to the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). So both stars are in LTE, which probably means I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, I think that means the population of a certain excited state is twice as high in star_1. Or maybe the excitation energy is higher? No, wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, that's the energy difference, ΔE. 

In the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = e^(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Or wait, sometimes it's written as (n2/n1) = e^(-h c (Δv)/(k T)), but I think for energy levels, it's the same idea.

So in this case, star_1's iron atoms have twice the excitation level as star_2 in the same energy level. Wait, the wording says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited." Oh wait, maybe the number of excited atoms (in a higher energy state) is twice that of star_2. So for each star, we have the ratio of excited to ground state (or lower state) atoms.

Let me define this more clearly. Let’s say for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (n_upper) to the number in a lower state (n_lower) is R = n_upper/n_lower.

Given that for star_1, R1 = 2 times R2. Because star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. Wait, no, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Or does it mean the
