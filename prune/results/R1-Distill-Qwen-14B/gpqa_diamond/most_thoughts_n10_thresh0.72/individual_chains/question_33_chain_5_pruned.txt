Okay, so I've got this cycloaddition problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione when heated. I need to find the exo product from the given options.

First, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. They involve a diene and a dienophile. The diene is usually the more electron-rich component, and the dienophile is electron-poor. So, I should figure out which of the two reactants is the diene and which is the dienophile.

Looking at 2,5-dimethylthiophene, thiophene is a five-membered aromatic ring with one sulfur. Its structure has two methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Thiophene is electron-rich because of the sulfur's lone pairs. So, does that make it a good diene? Wait, the diene needs conjugated double bonds. Thiophene has two double bonds, but I'm not sure if it can act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. Alternatively, I think in some cases, thiophene can act as a dienophile, but I'm not certain.

Furan-2,5-dione, on the other hand, has two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. Furan is electron-rich because of the oxygen, but the ketones are electron-withdrawing. So, furan-2,5-dione is probably more electron-poor, which would make it a good dienophile. That would mean the diene must be the other molecule, 2,5-dimethylthiophene. So, is 2,5-dimethylthiophene the diene here?

Wait, wait. Wait, another thought: Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene (the diene) and a dienophile, which is usually a molecule with a good electron-deficient double bond. Thiophene is aromatic and its double bonds are in a conjugated system, but for Diels-Alder, the diene needs to be in
