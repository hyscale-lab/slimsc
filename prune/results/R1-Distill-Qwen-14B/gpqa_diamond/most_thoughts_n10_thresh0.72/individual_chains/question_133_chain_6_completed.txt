Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights (Mw) are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

First, I should probably figure out the molar concentrations of each of the salts in the solution. Since the solution is made by dissolving these two substances, each will contribute some amount of phosphate species. But since they're phosphate-related compounds, I need to think about how they dissociate.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. I remember that when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, the formula would be KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (or disodium hydrogen phosphate, maybe?), but wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, I think it would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water molecules. So, Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O.

Wait, but the two salts, KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, when dissolved, would produce H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions respectively. So in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Now, the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, in solution, H3PO4 is a weak acid and tends to lose protons. So the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^3-? Or is it H3PO4? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, which can lose three protons to become HPO4^3- (the conjugate base after three deprotonations). But sometimes, I've heard the term "orthophosphate" referring to the HPO4^3- ion. Wait, but looking back, the problem might not use that terminology. Alternatively, sometimes H2PO4^- is called the dihydrogen phosphate ion, HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is orthophosphate. So perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3- because it's the most deprotonated form. But I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Let me think. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and each deprotonation gives H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-.

But wait, looking at the problem statement again: it says "concentration of orthophosphate ions." So that would be PO4^3-.

But looking at the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me see what each provides.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Neither of these is PO4^3-.

Wait, so how does PO4^3- form? That would come from further deprotonation of HPO4^2-. For that, the solution would need to have a high pH because the third dissociation is much weaker (Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small). But since we're mixing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in the same solution, perhaps there's some equilibrium going on.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should first calculate the concentrations of each salt, then see what their dissociation products are, and perhaps consider the pH of the solution to determine the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the presence of these salts will buffer the solution, and in this buffer, the concentration of PO4^3- can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

But wait, let me outline the steps I should take:

1. Calculate moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

2. Find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

3. Determine if these can form PO4^3- and what the concentration would be.

Wait, but given that both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in solution, and the solution is a buffer, perhaps the pH is determined by these two. But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: in a solution containing both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the phosphate species may not go all the way to PO4^3- because the pH isn't high enough. So the main species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but perhaps the orthophosphate (PO4^3-) is formed in some small amount.

Wait, but if we have a solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, can we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and then determine the concentration of PO4^3-?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial presence of these two salts will determine the pH, and from that, find the concentration of the respective phosphate species, including PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps the solution is a buffer solution because H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can act as a conjugate acid-base pair. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using the pKa2 value because that's the one between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Yes, because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (which is the Ka2). So the relevant pKa here is pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O. So their concentrations are determined by the moles of each salt.

So first, let's find the moles of each salt.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007346 mol.

Similarly, molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005616 mol.

These moles will be converted into concentrations in the 200 mL solution.

Molarity is moles / volume in liters. So, 200 mL is 0.2 L.

Concentration of KH2PO4 is 0.007346 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M. Since each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, the [H2PO4^-] is 0.03673 M.

Concentration of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.005616 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02808 M. Each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-, so [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.02808 / 0.03673) 

Let me compute 0.02808 / 0.03673 = approximately 0.765.

log(0.765) ≈ -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.208 -0.115 = 7.093.

So the pH is about 7.09.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, which is the third deprotonation.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

The expression for Ka3 is [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

We know Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M, and [H+] can be found from pH.

pH = 7.093 → [H+] = 10^-7.093 ≈ 8.27e-8 M.

So substituting:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.27e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 ≈ 5.054e-14.

Denominator: 8.27e-8.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 5.054e-14 / 8.27e-8 ≈ 6.11e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.1e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7, etc.

But wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 is:

1.8 * 0.02808 = 0.050544 → 5.0544e-2. But when multiplied by 1e-12, it's 5.0544e-14.

Divided by [H+] which is 8.27e-8.

So 5.0544e-14 / 8.27e-8 = ?

Let me compute 5.0544e-14 / 8.27e-8.

5.0544e-14 / 8.27e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.27) * 1e-6.

5.0544 /8.27 is approximately 0.6098.

So 0.6098e-6 → 6.098e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.10e-7 M.

So the concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.1e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close, but perhaps I should check more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pH calculation. Let me re-calculate that step.

The ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.765.

log(0.765) is more accurately around what? Let's compute:

Log(0.7) is about -0.1549, log(0.765) is between that and log(0.8)= -0.0969.

Alternatively, using calculator steps:

0.765 = 7.65e-1.

Log(7.65) is about 0.884.

So log(7.65e-1) = 0.884 -1 = -0.116.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.

Which is about 7.09. So [H+] is 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.128e-8 M.

So [H+] = 8.128e-8 M.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.128e-8.

1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

5.0544e-14 /8.128e-8 → 5.0544 /8.128 ≈ 0.6214 → 0.6214e-6 → 6.214e-7 M.

So that's about 6.21e-7 M. Which is close to option A (6.24e-7).

Hmm, but let me make sure. Are there any other factors I missed?

Wait, perhaps the solubility of the salts or any other reactions? But I think the main point is that we're considering the third dissociation of HPO4^2- to form PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps in the solution, the amount of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- is sufficient to affect the concentration of PO4^3- via the common ion effect, but I think the way I approached it is correct.

So the answer should be approximately 6.2e-7 M, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B) 5.48x10^-7 M 

C) 2.81x10^-7 M

D) 3.97x10^-7 M 

Wait, but my calculation gave 6.21e-7, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7.

But let me recheck the calculations with more precision.

Compute the exact [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-]:

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007344 mol.

Molarity: 0.007344 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03672 M → [H2PO4^-] = 0.03672 M.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 mol.

Molarity: 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M → [HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.2075.

Ratio = 0.02807 / 0.03672 = 0.7649.

log(0.7649) = ?

Let me calculate it more accurately.

Log(0.7649) = ?

We know that 10^(-0.115)=0.7649?

Wait, let me use a calculator approach:

Let me compute log(0.7649).

Using natural logarithm approximation:

ln(0.7649) ≈ -0.268.

But since log10(x)= ln(x)/ln(10), so:

log10(0.7649) ≈ (-0.268)/2.3026 ≈ -0.1163.

So pH = 7.2075 - 0.1163 ≈ 7.0912.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0912) = 10^-7 * 10^(-0.0912) ≈ 8.18e-8.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

Ka3=1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-]=0.02807, [H+]=8.18e-8.

So:

(1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / 8.18e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 ≈ 5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.18e-8.

So 5.0526e-14 / 8.18e-8 = (5.0526/8.18) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.18 ≈ 0.6172.

So 0.6172e-6 → 6.172e-7 M.

Which is about 6.17e-7 M.

Option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise calculations or perhaps rounding during the process.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the [H+] part.

Wait, 10^(-7.0912) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0912) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.825 ≈ 8.25e-8.

Wait, let me compute 10^(-0.0912).

Using the formula: 10^x ≈ e^(x ln10) ≈ e^(x*2.302585).

So 0.0912 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.2098.

e^0.2098 ≈ 1.233.

So 10^(-0.0912) = 1/1.233 ≈ 0.811.

So [H+]=1e-7 * 0.811 ≈ 8.11e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807)/8.11e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = 5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.11e-8.

So 5.0526e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.0526/8.11) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.11 ≈ 0.623.

So 0.623e-6 → 6.23e-7 M.

Ah, that's 6.23e-7, which is very close to option A's 6.24e-7. So option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: the problem says "orthophosphate ions". Could that be referring to HPO4^3- or PO4^3-?

Wait, no, PO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion. So my approach was correct.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use equilibrium expressions.

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of the salts
1. **KH₂PO₄**:  
   Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol.  
   Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007344 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Concentration = \( \frac{0.007344}{0.2} \approx 0.03672 \, \text{M} \).  
   Dissociates completely into \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \), so \( [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = 0.03672 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
   Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol.  
   Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Concentration = \( \frac{0.005614}{0.2} \approx 0.02807 \, \text{M} \).  
   Dissociates completely into \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \), so \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = 0.02807 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The relevant equilibrium is:  
\[
\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \leftrightarrow \text{HPO}_4^{2-} + \text{H}^+
\]  
The \( \text{pKa}_2 \) for this equilibrium is:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208
\]  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}\right)
\]  
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.02807}{0.03672}\right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.7649) \approx 7.208 - 0.116 \approx 7.092
\]  
Thus, \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.11 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The equilibrium for the third dissociation is:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{PO}_4^{3-} + \text{H}^+
\]  
The \( \text{Ka}_3 \) for this equilibrium is \( 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{PO}_4^{3-}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]  
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807)}{8.11 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0526 \times 10^{-14}}{8.11 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

**Answer: A**
