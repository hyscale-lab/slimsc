Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativistic particles and photon emission. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. So, first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they convert their mass into energy, which in this case becomes photons. Since both are moving along the horizontal axis, their collision is head-on. The positron is moving to the right, the electron is moving to the left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, but Lorentz factors... Lorentz factor gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So higher gamma means the object is moving closer to the speed of light. So the electron has gamma=4, the positron gamma=2.

I think I need to calculate their momenta and energies before the collision and then use conservation laws to find the photons' directions and energies.

Because energy and momentum are conserved. So the total energy before collision should equal the total energy after, and same for momentum.

Let me break it down.

First, the rest mass of an electron (and positron, since they're same mass) is m = 0.511 MeV/c². Wait, but using units where c=1 might make things easier, but maybe not. Let me think.

The total energy of each particle is gamma * m c². Because the rest energy is m c², and gamma accounts for kinetic energy.

So for the electron, gamma_e =4, so its energy E_e = 4 * m c².

Similarly, positron has gamma_p=2, so E_p = 2 * m c².

Wait, but wait: the positron's direction is opposite to the electron. So when considering momentum, their directions are opposite. So the positron's momentum p_p is positive (say, to the right), and the electron's p_e is negative (to the left), or vice versa.

Wait, electron is moving left (from the left), positron right (from the right). So in a coordinate system where right is positive, the electron's velocity is negative, and positron positive.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Electron is moving from left, so along the positive x direction (if I imagine the system where right is positive x). So the electron is moving right? No, wait. Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so it's moving towards the right. Similarly, the positron is moving from the right, so towards the left. Wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the problem says: electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So, in a coordinate system where to the right is positive x, the electron is moving in the positive x direction. The positron is moving from the right, so towards the left, which is negative x direction.

Wait, no, no. Wait, no. Wait, if the electron is moving along the horizontal from the
