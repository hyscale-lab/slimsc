Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So, S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar, but maybe this is one of them. Oh wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches S. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

Now, the operator Ay is c * S, so substituting c = h/(4π), we get:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to solve Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I'll find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me compute the matrix Ay - a I:

Ay - a I = [[(h/(4π))*0 - a, (h/(4π))*(-i)], 
           [(h/(4π))*i, (h/(4π))*0 - a]]

Simplify, that becomes:

[[-a, -i h/(4π) ],
 [ i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)))] 
= a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - [ (1)(h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

So det = a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16 π²), which gives a = ± h/(4π). Wait, that's because square roots of both sides. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix. I remember that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So S has eigenvalues ±1. Then Ay = c S, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(±1) = ±c. Since c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So that's correct.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, but the eigenvalues are purely real. Because the Pauli Y matrix has real eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues of Ay are real numbers, so their imaginary
