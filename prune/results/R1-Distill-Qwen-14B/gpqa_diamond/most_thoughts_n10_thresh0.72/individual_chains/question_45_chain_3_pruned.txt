Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, particles in a box have quantized energy levels.

Each particle is spin-1/2, so each can have two possible spin states, up or down. But wait, since they're identical particles, I think Pauli's exclusion principle applies. Oh right, identical fermions can't have the same set of quantum numbers. So each particle must have a unique combination of quantum numbers.

The potential well is one-dimensional with length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. So for each particle, n can be 1, 2, 3, etc., but since they're identical fermions, their wavefunctions must be antisymmetric.

But wait, each particle is also a spin-1/2, so the spin part of the wavefunction can contribute to the symmetry. The total wavefunction is a product of the spatial and spin parts, and for fermions, the total must be antisymmetric. So if the spatial part is symmetric, the spin part must be antisymmetric, and vice versa.

So, for four particles, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a one-dimensional box, the quantum numbers are just n, right? Because the other quantum numbers (like l and m) don't exist in 1D. So each particle's state is determined by its n value and its spin.

But wait, in 1D, the quantum number is just n, and spin is another degree of freedom. So each particle can have the same n but different spins, but wait, no, because for spin-1/2, each spin state (up or down) is a separate state. So two particles can have the same n but opposite spins, but more than that would violate the exclusion principle.

Wait, no, wait. Each particle is a fermion, so the wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of any two particles. So for the spatial part, if two particles have the same n, then swapping them would require the spatial part to be symmetric, so the spin part must be antisymmetric.

But with four particles, perhaps we need to arrange
