Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The energy E is given by E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy will be quantized based on their quantum number n.

Hmm, right. Since the particles are spin-1/2, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels depend only on the principal quantum number n, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...). The energy for each level is given by E_n = (n²)E, since E is the base unit when n=1.

Wait, so for each particle, their energy is n² times E. But because they're fermions, each can't have the same n. So I need to arrange them in the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion.

But wait, how do the quantum numbers work for multiple particles? Since they're spin-1/2, each has a spin quantum number s=1/2, so the possible spin states are up and down. So for each energy level n, you can have two particles: one with spin up and another with spin down. So each n can hold two particles.

Okay, so let's think about filling the levels. The ground state (lowest energy) would have the lowest possible n values filled with as many particles as possible.

So we have four particles. Let's list the n levels in order:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: can hold 2 particles
n=3: can hold 2, but we only have four particles total.

Wait, but four particles: n=1 can take 2, n=2 can take the next 2. So all four particles would be in n=1 and n=2 levels.

But wait, the problem is about the system of four particles. So the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. But wait, no, for identical particles, we can't just sum individual energies because their wavefunctions are anti-symmetrized. But in the case of non-interacting particles, which I think is the case here because the potential is infinite and we don't mention any interactions, the total energy is the sum of

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, particles in a box have quantized energy levels.

Each particle is spin-1/2, so each can have two possible spin states, up or down. But wait, since they're identical particles, I think Pauli's exclusion principle applies. Oh right, identical fermions can't have the same set of quantum numbers. So each particle must have a unique combination of quantum numbers.

The potential well is one-dimensional with length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. So for each particle, n can be 1, 2, 3, etc., but since they're identical fermions, their wavefunctions must be antisymmetric.

But wait, each particle is also a spin-1/2, so the spin part of the wavefunction can contribute to the symmetry. The total wavefunction is a product of the spatial and spin parts, and for fermions, the total must be antisymmetric. So if the spatial part is symmetric, the spin part must be antisymmetric, and vice versa.

So, for four particles, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a one-dimensional box, the quantum numbers are just n, right? Because the other quantum numbers (like l and m) don't exist in 1D. So each particle's state is determined by its n value and its spin.

But wait, in 1D, the quantum number is just n, and spin is another degree of freedom. So each particle can have the same n but different spins, but wait, no, because for spin-1/2, each spin state (up or down) is a separate state. So two particles can have the same n but opposite spins, but more than that would violate the exclusion principle.

Wait, no, wait. Each particle is a fermion, so the wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of any two particles. So for the spatial part, if two particles have the same n, then swapping them would require the spatial part to be symmetric, so the spin part must be antisymmetric.

But with four particles, perhaps we need to arrange
