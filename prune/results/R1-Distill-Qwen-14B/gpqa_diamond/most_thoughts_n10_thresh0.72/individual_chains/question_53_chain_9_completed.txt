Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best. 

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, the ring is benzene, I think, with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an O in the ester functional group. Esters typically have carbonyl groups (C=O) and an oxygen in the ether linkage, right? So the formula should include an ester group, which is O2 in the molecule because each ester has two oxygen atoms. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The ester functional group is R-O-CO-R. So each ester contributes two oxygen atoms. So the compound's formula should have at least two oxygen atoms.

Looking at the options, all of them have O2. So that's covered.

Now the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let's break down what each signal represents. 

The NMR shows two signals from aromatic H. So the benzene ring has two sets of Hs. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents might be in specific positions. For example, if the substituents are para, the aromatic Hs would be two sets of two each (but wait, para would have equivalent Hs, so maybe only one peak? Or maybe it's ortho or meta, which would give different splitting. Hmm, but the problem says two signals for aromatic H, so perhaps the substituents are in positions that create two distinct sets. Maybe the substituents are in the 1 and 2 positions (ortho), leading to two different types of Hs.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about di-substituted benzene rings and the possible substitution patterns. There are three possibilities: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4). 

In para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the ring has two equivalent sets of Hs. So for example, each substituent is in the 1 and 4 positions. The Hs would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the Hs might not be equivalent. Oh wait, wait! Wait, the substituents are different. Because if both substituents are the same, like two methyl groups para, then the aromatic Hs would have two equivalent Hs in positions 2 and 6, and another two in 3 and 5, but perhaps they are equivalent, resulting in one peak for each pair. But if the substituents are different, then the Hs in 2 and 6 may not be equivalent, and same for 3 and 5. So the NMR would show two doublets, maybe.

Wait, but the problem states that the NMR has two signals corresponding to aromatic H. So that implies there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons. So that would suggest that the substituents are adjacent (ortho) or in a position that splits the ring into two distinct environments.

Another thought: perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to two types of Hs. For example, if one substituent is in the 1 position and another in the 2 position (ortho), then the ring would have Hs in 3,4,5,6 positions. But wait, in that case, the Hs might not all be equivalent. Let me draw it mentally. If substituents are at 1 and 2, then the Hs at 3 and 6 would be adjacent to substituent at 2 and 1, respectively. Hs at 4 and 5 would be across from substituent 1 and 2. Wait, maybe that would lead to four distinct Hs, but perhaps some are equivalent, leading to two signals. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the Hs are split into two equivalent pairs. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me move on and see other parts of the NMR.

The NMR also shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets because each H is adjacent to one other H. But a doublet of quartets suggests more splitting. Wait, vinyl Hs are on adjacent carbons, so each would couple with the other. So each would be a doublet, but perhaps in this case, one is also coupling with another group. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is adjacent to an ester group, leading to more splitting. 

Wait, if the compound has an ester group, maybe connected to a vinyl group. Like an acrylate ester or something similar. Such as something like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Wait, but that's an acryloxy group. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-R attached to a vinyl group.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The compound is a di-substituted benzene. One of the substituents is an ester group, perhaps.

Wait, but the problem says that the ester group is present, so perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents, one being an ester group and the other something else. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group and the other is another group, like a methyl group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR: there are two signals for –CH3 groups. So the molecule has two methyl groups. So perhaps the substituents on the benzene are an ester group and another group that includes a methyl, like a methyl ester.

Let me consider the structure. Maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group, such as O-CO-O-R, and the other is a methyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a vinyl group. Wait, more accurately, maybe the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. But wait, the NMR shows two methyl groups. So perhaps the substituents are an ester and something with two methyl groups, but that seems less likely.

Wait, looking again: the NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So, perhaps each methyl is a singlet, but the question doesn't specify that. But two signals for methyl, so two different methyl groups.

Putting this together: the benzene ring has two substituents. One substituent is an ester group, which would have an O and a carbonyl. The other substituent is perhaps a vinyl group attached to a methyl, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe the other substituent is a group that includes a methyl, like a methyl ester.

Wait, perhaps the ester is attached to a vinyl group, and the other substituent is a methyl group, but that would lead to how many signals?

Wait, let's think about the substituents. Let's say the benzene has an ester substituent and a vinyl substituent. The ester group would be something like O-CO-O-R, where R might be a methyl group. So, for example, methyl benzoate is a benzene ring with a substituent -O-CO-Me. Then the vinyl group would be another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a propenyl group (vinyl group) attached to a methyl.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester group and a group with a vinyl and methyl, like a vinyl methyl ester. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene with substituents as an ester group (like -O-CO-R) and a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Wait, but that's getting more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and another group that has a methyl and a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester group and a propenyl group (like CH2=CHCH2-) attached to the ring. No, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a methyl group.

Wait, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula options are:

A) C11H14O2 → Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so (2*11 + 2 -14 -0 +0)/2 → (24 -14)/2 = 5. So 5 degrees: benzene ring (3 DoU) and ester (which has a double bond in the carbonyl, 1 DoU), so that's 4. Hmm, that gives 4, but the formula has 5. So perhaps another DoU elsewhere. Maybe a vinyl group adds another DoU.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group attached to a methyl.

Wait, another approach: the problem says that the 1H NMR has six signals. Let's count the number of distinct proton environments.

- 2 aromatic protons signals → 2 sets of aromatic H.
- 2 vinyl H signals → 2 sets of vinyl H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets).
- 2 methyl groups → 2 sets of CH3.

So, total 6 signals. So that adds up.

So, the benzene has two substituents, each of which brings in their own groups. Let me imagine the structure.

Maybe one substituent is an ester group like O-CO-R, and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a larger substituent.

Wait, another possible structure: the benzene has two substituents, one being an ester group (O-CO-O-R), and the other being a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CH2-O-CO-R, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group with a methyl branch. For example, the structure could be something like methyl (vinyl) benzoate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester where the ester oxygen is attached to a vinyl group, which is attached to a methyl.

Wait, another thought: the benzene ring has two substituents. One is an ester group, say, -O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group. The other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, perhaps as a substituent. So the substituents would be -O-CO-OCH3 and -CH2CH2- (but that's not vinyl). Alternatively, the vinyl group would be like -CH2-CH2- but that's not a vinyl. Wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group connected to a methyl group. For example, the structure could be something like:

Benzene ring with substituent at position 1: O-CO-O-R (ester group, R is methyl), and substituent at position 2: CH2-CH2-O-R, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a substituent that includes a vinyl group and a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group that is also an ester. For example, the substituent could be a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. So the substituent itself is an ester attached to a vinyl group.

Wait, but then how many signals would that produce in the NMR?

Let me try to imagine this structure: the benzene ring has two substituents, one is an ester group (like O-CO-OCH3) and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3. Wait, but that's a butenyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an oxygen, like O-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. For example, the substituent is a group like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2CH2..., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and an allyl group with a methyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the H NMR signals.

The aromatic Hs: two signals. So perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the ring's Hs are split into two sets. Like if the substituents are in the ortho position (1 and 2), leading to two distinct sets of Hs (maybe H at 3,4 and 5,6). Alternatively, if the substituents are in the meta positions, that could lead to two different sets.

The vinyl Hs: one is a doublet (so each H is next to one other H), and the other is a doublet of quartets. A quartet suggests coupling with three Hs, perhaps. So maybe one vinyl H is coupling with another H (so a doublet), and another is coupling with both that H and three others, leading to a quartet. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester. Like, the substituent is an ester where the oxygen is attached to a vinyl group. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-. No, that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2- would be a propyl group, but that's not vinyl. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that's getting too complex.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester. For example, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a group like O-CO-O-CH=CH2. Wait, but that would be an allyl ester group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. Like, the structure is benzene with a substituent that is a vinyl ester, such as CH2=CH-O-CO-R, where R is a methyl group. So the substituent would be CH2=CH-O-CO-Me. Then, the other substituent on the benzene is another group.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Let's think about the NMR.

If the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-Me, then the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH group. The CH2 would have two Hs, and the CH would have one H. No, wait, that's not right. The structure would be CH2=CH-O-CO-Me. So the vinyl group is CH2-CH2-O-CO-Me. Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure would be CH2=CH-O-CO-R, where R is the benzene ring. So the substituent is attached as O-CO-R, where R is a CH2=CH group attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an ester group (-O-CO-OCH3) and the other is a vinyl group with a methyl group attached, like -CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's not a vinyl.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a methyl group attached to a vinyl, like CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. But that would be a butenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl attached. Like, CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. But that would give different NMR signals.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester. For example, the structure is methyl (vinyl) benzoate. So the substituent would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2..., but that's getting a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. So the benzene ring has O-CO-R attached via an oxygen, and R is a vinyl group.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals again. The vinyl Hs: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the vinyl group is adjacent to another group that causes splitting. For example, if the vinyl H is next to an ester oxygen, which is deshielded, leading to coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like this: the benzene ring has two substituents. One is an ester group, say, O-CO-OCH3, and the other substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a substituent with a vinyl and a methyl. So the vinyl group would have two Hs, perhaps as a doublet, and the methyl would be a singlet. But in this case, the methyl is at the end, so it would be a singlet. But the NMR shows two methyl signals, so perhaps there's another methyl group elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the ester is part of a vinyl group. For example, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ether, not an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester and a vinyl group connected to another methyl. Let me think: benzene ring, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (methyl ester), and substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 (isobutyl group). But that would have a vinyl group and a methyl group. Then the NMR would show:

- Aromatic H: two signals (assuming substituents are in positions that split the ring into two environments).
- Vinyl Hs: the CH2=CH group would have two Hs, each as a doublet. Wait, but in the NMR, there are two signals for vinyl Hs: one doublet, one doublet of quartets. So maybe one of the vinyl Hs is coupling with another group, leading to a quartet.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and a vinyl group. The ester is attached as O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, but that's an ethyl ester, so the methyl group isn't present. Alternatively, maybe the ester is a methyl ester, so O-CO-OCH3, and the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to another methyl group. Like, substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CHCH3. Then the NMR would show:

- Aromatic H: two signals.
- Vinyl H: the CH2=CHCH3 group would have two Hs on the CH2 (each as a quartet, maybe), and the CH3 would be a triplet. But the problem states that the NMR has two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. Then, the vinyl group would have Hs on the CH2 and CH groups. The CH2 would have two Hs as a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH), and the CH would have one H as a doublet. But the NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one quartet. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group where the vinyl is part of an ester. For example, the substituent could be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (an ethyl ester), but that's not a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (a propyl ester), but again, not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like this: the benzene ring has two substituents. One is an ester group, say, O-CO-OCH3, and the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl, like CH2=CH-OCH3. Then, the substituent would be OCH2CH2O-CO-OCH3? Not sure. Alternatively, the substituent could be O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that seems complicated.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this by considering the molecular formula options.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → Degree of Unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5.

B) C12H14O2 → (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6.

C) C12H12O2 → (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7.

D) C11H12O2 → (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6.

The benzene ring has 3 DoU. An ester contributes 2 DoU (the carbonyl and the ester oxygen, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to count). Wait, I think the DoU is calculated as (each double bond or ring is +1). So ester group has a carbonyl (1 DoU) and an ether linkage (which doesn't add a DoU). So the ester contributes 1 DoU.

Other substituents that are unsaturated would add more DoU. For example, a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds 1 DoU.

So, let's see:

For option C: DoU is 7. Benzene ring (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5. So 7-5=2 more DoU. Where would that come from? Maybe another ring or double bond. Not sure.

Option A: DoU 5. Benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) → total 5. That fits.

Option B: DoU 6. So 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) + 1 (vinyl) =5, leaving 1 more. Maybe another double bond or ring. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent that is a methyl group but that doesn't add DoU.

Option D: DoU is 6. So 3 +1+1=5, leaving 1 more, similar to B.

So, the correct structure would need to match the DoU. So options A and C have DoU 5 and 7, respectively.

Wait, option C has 7 DoU. So benzene (3), ester (1), vinyl (1) → 5. So 2 more DoU. Maybe a substituent that has a ring or another double bond. Alternatively, perhaps another substituent that's a cyclopropane or something, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe a substituent with a double bond besides the vinyl.

But let's think about the structure again. If the substituent is a vinyl group, that adds one DoU. So the only other DoU besides the benzene and ester would come from the substituents.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a group with a ring, like a cyclopropyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent has another double bond. For example, a di-substituted vinyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two ester groups. But the problem states that the FTIR shows an ester group, not multiple. Also, the options don't have more than two oxygen atoms, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group connected to a methyl group, which would contribute to the DoU.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester and an allyl group. The allyl group (CH2=CH-CH2-) has one DoU (the double bond). So that would add one more DoU, making the total DoU for the molecule 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) + 1 (allyl) =5. Which would match option A (C11H14O2: DoU 5).

Alternatively, if the substituent is a group that has two DoU, that would fit option B or D.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this approach. Let me try to think of the structure again.

The NMR shows two CH3 groups. So the molecule has two methyl groups.

The ester group would contribute to one of them. For example, methyl ester: O-CO-OCH3. Then, where would the other methyl come from?

Perhaps the other substituent is a group with a methyl group, like a vinyl group attached to a methyl. For example, the substituent could be CH2=CHCH3.

So, the structure is benzene ring with substituents O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CHCH3.

Wait, but that would make the substituents on the benzene O-CO-OCH3 (from the ester) and CH2=CHCH3 (a propenyl group? Wait, CH2=CHCH3 is a propene group, but that's a substituent with a double bond.

So the benzene would have substituents O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CHCH3. Let's see how many signals that would produce in the NMR.

The aromatic Hs: substituents are in certain positions. Let's say they're para to each other. Then, the aromatic Hs would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Are they equivalent? If substituents are para and different, the aromatic Hs would have two distinct sets of two each. So each pair (2,6) and (3,5) would be equivalent, leading to two signals for aromatic H. That matches the NMR description.

Then, the substituent O-CO-OCH3 would have a methyl group as a singlet (the OCH3). The other substituent, CH2=CHCH3, would have two Hs on the CH2 (each as a triplet, perhaps, from coupling with the adjacent CH), and the CH would have one H as a doublet. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for vinyl H: one doublet and one quartet.

Wait, perhaps the CH2=CHCH3 is not the substituent but a substituent with a vinyl group and another methyl. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, where R is a methyl group. So, the substituent would be CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. Then, the vinyl group would have Hs on the CH2 and CH.

The CH2 would have two Hs, each as a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH). The CH would have one H, as a doublet (coupled with the CH2 and perhaps another group). But the NMR shows one doublet and one quartet for vinyl Hs.

Wait, that might fit. The CH2 would be a quartet, and the CH would be a doublet. So that would match the NMR's description of two signals: one doublet and one quartet.

But then the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (the ester) and the other substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3? No, that would be a single substituent, but the molecule is di-substituted. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents are an ester and a vinyl group, each attached to the benzene ring. For example, substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3, substituent 2: CH2=CHCH2CH3. But then the NMR would have:

- Aromatic Hs: two signals, perhaps as two doublets.
- Vinyl Hs: the CH2=CH group would have two Hs on the CH2 as a quartet (each coupled with the adjacent CH), and the CH would have one H as a doublet. So that's two signals for vinyl Hs: quartet and doublet.
- The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3, but the problem states that there are no CH2 signals. Wait, but the substituent is CH2=CHCH2CH3, which would have a CH2 next to the CH2=CH group, leading to a CH2 that would appear as a triplet. But the problem states that there are no CH2 groups. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, the NMR shows that there are no signals for –CH2 groups. So any CH2 groups in the structure must be either not present or not showing up as separate signals. But the problem says there are two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups, which suggests that there are two methyl groups present.

So, another approach: let's count the number of each type of H.

Aromatic H: 2 signals. Let's assume each signal has 2 Hs. So 4 aromatic Hs. But a benzene ring has 6 Hs, so perhaps each substituent is ortho to each other, leading to two sets of two Hs each. Hmm, but that would be 4 Hs. So where are the other two? Wait, perhaps the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic Hs to split into two doublets, each with two Hs. So total of 4 aromatic Hs, leaving two more Hs. Oh wait, no, that's not possible because the benzene has six Hs. So perhaps the substituents are such that the aromatic Hs are in two sets of two each, and the other two Hs are equivalent in another way. Hmm, maybe it's a 1,2-disubstituted benzene, leading to two sets of two Hs each and two more Hs that are equivalent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic Hs to split into two sets, each with two Hs, and the other four Hs are split into two more sets. Hmm, but that would give more than two signals, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the 1 and 3 positions (meta), leading to two sets of aromatic Hs. For example, each substituent in meta would split the ring into two equivalent sets of Hs, giving two signals, each with two Hs. So that would account for four aromatic Hs. But where are the other two Hs? Oh wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Benzene has six Hs, so if two substituents are present, they could take up two of the positions, leaving four Hs. So if substituents are in 1 and 3 positions, the Hs would be in 2,4,5,6. Are these Hs equivalent in pairs? Hs at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and Hs at 4 and 5 would be equivalent. So two signals for aromatic H: each with two Hs. That fits the problem.

So the aromatic Hs would have two signals: each a doublet, perhaps.

Now, the substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a group with a vinyl and methyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (ester) and CH2=CHCH3 (vinyl group with methyl). So the benzene has substituents at 1 and 3 positions (meta).

So the substituent at 1 is O-CO-OCH3, and the substituent at 3 is CH2=CHCH3.

Then, the NMR would show:

- Aromatic Hs: two doublets, each integrating for two Hs.

- Vinyl Hs: the substituent CH2=CHCH3 would have a CH2 group (two Hs) and a CH group (one H). The CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, so each H on CH2 would be a quartet. The CH would be adjacent to CH2, so each H would be a triplet. So the vinyl Hs would show as a quartet (CH2) and a triplet (CH). But the problem states that the vinyl Hs are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3, making the substituent a vinyl ester. Then, the Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, giving a quartet, and the CH would be adjacent to the CH2 and perhaps another group, giving a doublet of quartets. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-R, where R is a methyl. So the substituent is O-CO-OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, R is a benzene ring. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the molecular formula.

The options are C11H14O2, C12H14O2, etc. Let's count the carbons.

If the benzene ring has two substituents, each substituent brings some carbons.

Suppose one substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-O-R. If R is a methyl, that's one carbon. So the ester substituent contributes 3 carbons (O-CO-OCH3: the carbonyl, the oxygen, and the methyl). Wait, no: the ester group is O-CO-O-R. So, for methyl ester, R is CH3, so the ester group contributes (COOCH3) which is 3 carbons.

Wait, the full structure would be benzene-O-CO-OCH3, but that's just one substituent (a methyl ester). The other substituent needs to contribute more carbons.

Let me count for each option.

Option D: C11H12O2.

Benzene (6 C) + substituents: 11-6=5 C from substituents.

Two substituents: so 5 C in total. So each substituent adds, say, 2 and 3 C.

If one substituent is an ester group (O-CO-OCH3): that's 3 C (COOCH3). The other substituent would then add 2 C. So perhaps the other substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3. But that's 3 C (CH2=CHCH3 is 3 carbons). Wait, but that would require 3 +3 =6 C, plus benzene's 6 makes 12 C, which would be option B. Hmm, that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting. Let me think again.

The molecular formula includes the benzene ring.

Let's take option D: C11H12O2.

Benzene has 6 C. So substituents contribute 5 C.

If one substituent is a methyl ester group (O-CO-OCH3), that's 3 C (COOCH3). The other substituent must contribute 2 C.

So substituent 2 could be a substituent with 2 C. For example, a methylene group (CH2), but that's unlikely as it would be a CH2, which would show up in the NMR as a CH2 group. But the problem states that there are no CH2 signals. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), but that's 2 C, but the substituent would need to be attached to something else. Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2 group attached to a methyl, but that would be a CH2CH3 group, which would show up as a triplet in NMR, but the problem says there are no CH2 groups.

Hmm, maybe substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to something else. But I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to another group that doesn't have CH2. For example, substituent 2 could be CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, that would be a substituent with 5 C (O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3, which is 3 C. So if the other substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C), total substituent C is 6. Benzene is 6, so total would be 12 C. That would be option B (C12H14O2).

Then, the molecular formula would be C12H14O2, option B.

Wait, let's check the degrees of unsaturation. C12H14O2: DoU = (2*12 + 2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6.

Benzene ring: 3 DoU. Ester group: 1 DoU (from the carbonyl). Vinyl group: 1 DoU. So that's 5. So where does the sixth DoU come from? Perhaps another double bond or ring.

Wait, if substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3, that's a vinyl group (1 DoU). So total DoU would be 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) + 1 (vinyl) =5. But the formula has 6 DoU. So where is the sixth?

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 is a group with two DoU. For example, benzene (3) + ester (1) + substituent with 2 DoU → total 6.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a group like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that's an ester and doesn't add DoU. Alternatively, substituent 2 could have a ring or another double bond.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a benzyl group, which adds a ring. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the structure again.

The substituents are an ester group and a group with a vinyl and a methyl. So, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl methyl group, like CH2=CHCH3. That's 3 C. The ester substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C). Benzene is 6 C. So total C is 6+3+3=12. So molecular formula is C12H14O2, which is option B. Now, degrees of unsaturation: 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5. But option B has DoU 6. So where's the sixth?

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 has another double bond. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2CH3, which has one DoU. So total DoU is 3+1+1=5. Not matching option B's DoU of 6.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a cyclopropane group, which has one DoU (a ring). So the substituent would be CH2=CH-C3H5, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group with a double bond and a ring, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the substituent is a group that includes an ester and a vinyl. For example, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's an ethyl ester and doesn't include a vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but that doesn't include a vinyl group.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the H count.

The molecular formula options:

Option A: C11H14O2 → H=14.

Option B: C12H14O2 → H=14.

Option C: C12H12O2 → H=12.

Option D: C11H12O2 → H=12.

So, the structure must have 14 H for options A and B, and 12 for C and D.

Let me think of the structure again. Suppose the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H) and CH2=CHCH3 (3 C, 3 H). Then, benzene has 6 C and 5 H (since two substituents take two H positions). Wait, no, each substituent replaces an H on the benzene ring.

Wait, benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H, so two substituents replace two H, leaving 4 H on the ring. So aromatic H count is 4.

Then, the substituents:

O-CO-OCH3: the methyl group contributes 3 H.

CH2=CHCH3: the CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. Wait, but that's 2+1+3=6 H.

Plus the aromatic H: 4 H. So total H is 4 + 3 (from OCH3) +6 (from substituent) =13 H. But the formula options for options A and B have 14 H. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some H. Let me recount:

Benzene: 6 H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 → replaces one H → so 5 H left on benzene. Substituent 1 contributes 3 H (from OCH3).

Substituent 2: CH2=CHCH3 → replaces another H → 4 H left on benzene. Substituent 2 contributes 2 (CH2) +1 (CH) +3 (CH3) =6 H.

So, total H: 4 (aromatic) +3 (OCH3) +6 (substituent 2) =13 H. But option A has 14 H. So that's one short.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a different group. Maybe substituent 2 is CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene, which has 4 H.

Wait, substituent 2 is CH2=CH2: that's 2 C and 4 H. Then benzene's H would be 4 (after substitution). Substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 → 3 H. Substituent 2 contributes 4 H. So total H: 4+3+4=11. Plus H from substituent 1: OCH3 has 3 H. Hmm, that's 11. So formula would be C9H11O2, which isn't one of the options. So that's incorrect.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group connected to a methyl via an ester. So substituent 2 is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. That doesn't include a vinyl, so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a group with a double bond and a methyl, but I'm not finding the right fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-R, where R is a methyl. So substituent 2 is CH2=CH-O-CH3. Then, substituent 2 contributes 5 C (CH2=CH-OCH3: 2+1+1+1=5? No, wait, CH2=CH-OCH3 is 4 C: CH2, CH, O, CH3.

Wait, the substituent 2 would be CH2=CH-O-CH3. So that's 4 C, 3 H (from CH3), 2 H (from CH2), and 1 H (from CH). But the substituent is attached to the benzene, so substituent 2 would contribute 4 C.

Substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C).

So total C: benzene (6) + substituent 1 (3 C) + substituent 2 (4 C) =13 C. But the options only go up to C12. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl, like CH2=CHCH2CH3. That's 4 C, 5 H (CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 has 2+1+2+3 H). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3 (isobutylene). That's 3 C, 5 H.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: CH2=CHCH3 (3 C, 5 H).

Benzene: 6 C, 4 H.

Total H: 4 (aromatic) +3 (OCH3) +5 (substituent 2) =12 H. So formula would be C12H12O2, which is option C. But option C has DoU 7, which would require another DoU somewhere. Let's see.

Benzene: 3 DoU.

Ester: 1 DoU.

Vinyl group: 1 DoU.

Total: 5 DoU. But formula C12H12O2 has 7 DoU. So that's a discrepancy.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another point in the NMR: there are two signals for methyl groups. So two different methyl groups. One could be the OCH3 from the ester, and the other could be a CH3 connected to the vinyl group.

Wait, if substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3, then the CH3 is a singlet, perhaps. So that's one methyl group. The OCH3 from the ester is another methyl group. So two signals for methyl groups, which matches the NMR.

Now, the H count:

OCH3:3 H.

CH3 (from substituent 2):3 H.

Vinyl CH2:2 H → quartet.

Vinyl CH:1 H → doublet.

Aromatic H:4 H → two doublets.

So total H:3+3+2+1+4=13 H. But the formula options A and B have 14 H. So where's the missing H?

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 is a group with more Hs. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 (but that's 4 C, 6 H).

Wait, substituent 2: CH2=CHCH2CH3.

H count: CH2=CHCH2CH3 has 2 H on the first CH2, 1 H on CH, 2 H on the second CH2, and 3 H on CH3. So 2+1+2+3=8 H.

Substituent 1 (OCH3):3 H.

Aromatic H:4 H.

Total H:4+3+8=15 H. But that's more than the options.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a different group. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are O-CO-OCH3 and CH2=CH2. That's ethylene, which has 4 H.

So substituent 1: O-CO-OCH3 (3 H).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH2 (4 H).

Aromatic H:4 H.

Total H:3+4+4=11 H. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-O-CH3, which is allyl methyl ether. That substituent has 3 C and 5 H (CH2=CH-O-CH3: CH2 (2H), CH (1H), OCH3 (3H)). So substituent 2 contributes 5 H.

So total H:4 (aromatic) +3 (OCH3) +5 (substituent 2) =12 H. That would be option D (C11H12O2), but substituent 2 is 3 C, substituent 1 is 3 C, benzene is 6 C → total 12 C. Option D is C11H12O2 → 11 C. So that's not matching.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should just make a decision based on the information.

The ester group contributes O2. The structure has two methyl groups. The substituents on the benzene ring are an ester and a group with a vinyl and methyl. The molecular formula likely is C12H14O2, which is option B.

Wait, but the DoU doesn't add up. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, where R is a methyl. So substituent 2 would be CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. Let me count the C: benzene (6), substituent 1 (O-CO-OCH3: 3 C from ester and OCH3), substituent 2 (CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3: 5 C). That would make total C:6+3+5=14, which is beyond the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D) C11H12O2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The NMR has two methyl groups. So the molecule has two CH3 groups. The ester contributes one (OCH3). The other must be somewhere else.

If substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl, perhaps as CH2=CH-CH3. So substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3. That's 3 C and 5 H.

So substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH3 (3 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: 3 C, 5 H.

Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12 → C12.

Total H:4+3+5=12 H.

So formula is C12H12O2, which is option C.

DoU for C12H12O2: (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7.

Benzene:3 DoU.

Ester:1 DoU.

Vinyl:1 DoU.

Total:5. So where's the 2 more DoU? Maybe another double bond or ring in substituent 2.

Wait, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH3, which has one DoU (the vinyl). So that's accounted for.

Ah, but the ester group includes O, which doesn't add a DoU. So perhaps substituent 2 has another DoU, like a ring. But CH2=CHCH3 doesn't have a ring.

Hmm. I might have to go with the structure that fits the NMR signals, even if the DoU doesn't add up perfectly. 

Given all this, I think the correct formula is C12H14O2, option B.


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following signals:

- **Two signals for aromatic protons**: This suggests the benzene ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons, likely due to the substituents being in positions that create two environments (e.g., ortho or meta substitution).
- **Two signals for vinyl protons**: One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This indicates a vinyl group with specific coupling patterns.
- **Two signals for methyl groups**: These correspond to two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.

The absence of signals for CH2 groups implies that any CH2 groups in the structure are either not present or do not appear as separate signals in the NMR spectrum.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: C11H14O2**
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU): \( \text{DoU} = \frac{2(11) + 2 - 14}{2} = 5 \).
   - Benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU. This accounts for all 5 DoU.
   - However, the molecular formula suggests 11 carbons, which is inconsistent with the structure requiring a benzene ring (6 carbons), an ester group (3 carbons), and a vinyl group (2 carbons), totaling 11 carbons. This option is plausible.

2. **Option B: C12H14O2**
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU): \( \text{DoU} = \frac{2(12) + 2 - 14}{2} = 6 \).
   - Benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU. This leaves 2 additional DoU unaccounted for, which could arise from another double bond or ring in the structure.
   - The molecular formula suggests 12 carbons, which is consistent with a benzene ring (6 carbons), an ester group (3 carbons), and a vinyl group with additional carbons (3 carbons). This option is plausible.

3. **Option C: C12H12O2**
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU): \( \text{DoU} = \frac{2(12) + 2 - 12}{2} = 7 \).
   - Benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU. This leaves 3 additional DoU unaccounted for, which would require additional double bonds or rings in the structure.
   - The molecular formula suggests 12 carbons, which is consistent with a benzene ring (6 carbons), an ester group (3 carbons), and a vinyl group with additional carbons (3 carbons). However, the DoU discrepancy makes this option less likely.

4. **Option D: C11H12O2**
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU): \( \text{DoU} = \frac{2(11) + 2 - 12}{2} = 6 \).
   - Benzene ring contributes 3 DoU, the ester group contributes 1 DoU, and the vinyl group contributes 1 DoU. This accounts for all 6 DoU.
   - The molecular formula suggests 11 carbons, which is inconsistent with the structure requiring a benzene ring (6 carbons), an ester group (3 carbons), and a vinyl group (2 carbons), totaling 11 carbons. This option is plausible.

### Final Considerations:
The structure must include a benzene ring, an ester group, and a vinyl group with methyl substituents. The NMR signals for two methyl groups suggest the presence of two distinct CH3 groups. The molecular formula must account for the total number of protons, carbons, and degrees of unsaturation.

Option B (C12H14O2) aligns best with the given NMR data and molecular formula, as it provides enough carbons to accommodate the benzene ring, ester group, and vinyl group, while the DoU can be explained by additional unsaturation in the vinyl group or substituents.

**Answer: B**
