Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the actual question seems to have two parts, A and B. Let me parse each part.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which compound does not show tautomerism.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism.

And the options are A to D, each pairing A and B's answers.

First, I need to tackle part A. Let's think about tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, leading to different structures. The most common example is the keto-enol tautomerism in ketones and aldehydes. So, for a compound to show tautomerism, it must have the necessary structure—like adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can shift.

Looking at the two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (O). Wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho, but in any case, it's a cyclic diketone. Let me visualize it. So, it's a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms, each attached via a double bond (as in a ketone). So, the structure is something like O=C6H4-C=O. Or wait, wait, benzoquinone is the di-ortho or para-dione.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would be a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at the 1,3,5 positions. So, the ring has three carbonyl groups, each at every other carbon. So, it's a cyclic triketone.

Tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's see. For benzoquinone, each ketone is on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are part of the aromatic ring. So, each C=O is attached to a benzene carbon. But in aromatic rings, the adjacent carbons are sp² hybridized. So, are there any hydrogens that can shift? Wait, the H adjacent to a carbonyl in a benzene ring—like in para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at positions 1 and 4 (if it's para), so the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6 (for the first carbonyl), and 3 and 5 for the other. Hmm, but wait, in those positions, are there any hydrogens? Well, in the benzene ring, each carbon has one hydrogen if it's mono-substituted. But in benzoquinone, the positions adjacent to the carbonyl are connected to other carbons in the ring, which are already substituted. Wait, maybe the structure is more like O=C-C6H3-C=O? No, wait, it's a benzene ring with two keto groups. So, each of those carbonyls is attached to a carbon that is part of the ring. So, the ring is fully conjugated, and the adjacent carbons are each attached to another ring carbon. So, in that scenario, the carbons adjacent to the ketones are each part of the ring, so maybe any H's are in positions that don't allow for tautomerism. Wait, but in a benzene ring, if a carbon is part of the ring, the adjacent carbons are connected via double bonds. So, maybe the H's are not positioned in a way that allows tautomerism. Alternatively, perhaps in benzoquinone, the structure is such that the carbonyl groups are on adjacent ring positions, so maybe there are no adjacent H's to allow enol formation. Hmm, not entirely sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each of those ketone groups is on a ring carbon, and each is adjacent to other ring carbons. So, are any of those ring carbons bearing H's adjacent to a carbonyl group? Wait, if it's a cyclohexane ring, which is typically in a chair conformation, but in the case of trione, the ring is rigid with three carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5. So, each carbonyl is on a different carbon, separated by two carbons. So, each carbonyl carbon is adjacent to two other carbons that are part of the ring. Each of those carbons (like position 2, 4, 6) would be CH2 groups, perhaps? Or maybe more like each carbonyl is on a carbon with two substituents. Hmm, not entirely clear on the structure.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is similar to benzene-1,3,5-trione, but as a cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps each of the three carbonyl groups is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring, and each of those carbonyl carbons is adjacent to two other ring carbons. So, for each carbonyl group, the adjacent carbons are ring CH groups. So, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is connected to two other carbons, which are part of the ring. So, perhaps each of those adjacent carbons is a CH2 group? Hmm, maybe.

But getting back to tautomerism. Tautomerism typically requires that a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl (like in a keto group) can shift to form an enol. So, for a compound to show tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. If that's not present, then tautomerism won't occur.

So, for benzoquinone: each carbonyl is on a benzene ring carbon. The adjacent carbons are part of the ring, but in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one substituent (like the O in the ketone). So, each ring carbon in benzoquinone is bonded to the ketone O and two other ring carbons. So, each of those adjacent carbons (to the carbonyl) is part of the ring and doesn't have any hydrogens attached? Because in a benzene ring, each carbon has one H when not substituted, but in this case, the carbonyl is a substituent. So, the ring carbons adjacent to the carbonyl would be benzene carbons, each attached to two other ring carbons. So, perhaps each of those adjacent carbons is a CH group, meaning they have one H. But wait, if the ring is aromatic, the substituents are in positions that prevent tautomerism. Because for tautomerism, the H must be on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, but in this case, the adjacent carbon is part of the aromatic ring, which is conjugated. Maybe that prevents the necessary acidity for tautomerism.

Wait, but in a carbonyl group, the alpha hydrogens are acidic because the conjugate base (enolate) is stabilized. But in aromatic rings, the alpha positions are already part of the conjugated system. So, perhaps in benzoquinone, the alpha positions are the ring carbons, which are already in a conjugated system, and thus tautomerism isn't possible because there's no available hydrogen in the correct position. Alternatively, perhaps the structure doesn't allow for the necessary movement of the hydrogen.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is on a cyclohexane ring. Assuming the ring isn't aromatic, each carbonyl carbon is connected to two CH2 groups (or similar). So, each of those adjacent carbons would have H's attached. So, in that case, the compound would have alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, if the ring is fully conjugated with three carbonyl groups, perhaps the structure is more rigid, making tautomerism difficult. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is more likely to show tautomerism because it has alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. If it's para-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring. The positions between them are all part of the ring. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the ring and don't have any H's available because the ring structure doesn't allow it. Therefore, perhaps benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH2 groups, which have H's. So, this compound would undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Tautomerism occurs when a hydrogen can move (tautomeric shift) between adjacent atoms, usually between a carbonyl group and an adjacent double bond or lone pair. For example, in ketones, the enol form has a double bond next to the carbonyl, and the keto form has the carbonyl with an adjacent H.

So, for a compound to show tautomerism, it must have at least one alpha H (a H attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group). In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the ring, so they're connected by double bonds. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are each part of the aromatic ring, so they don't have any H's attached. Because in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one substituent (the carbonyl) and two other ring carbons, so they have no H's. Hence, no alpha H's in benzoquinone, so it can't undergo tautomerism.

In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring isn't aromatic, so the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are CH2 groups (or similar). So, each of those has two H's attached. So, they have alpha H's, allowing for tautomerism.

So, part A is about which does not show tautomerism. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does? Or wait, wait. Because if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha H's, it would have tautomerism. But wait, if the ring is fully conjugated, maybe the structure is such that the H's can't move. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the trione is more rigid. But in any case, assuming that benzoquinone lacks alpha H's, then it can't tautomerize, so it doesn't show tautomerism. So, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but the question says, A is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So, in the options, in option D, A is benzoquinone. So, part A is benzoquinone.

Now, part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism (or enantiomerism) occurs when a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon bonded to four different groups.

So, let's analyze each compound.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but as an ester. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Let me draw it.

The structure is: CH2(COOCH3)(OH)CH3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH becomes OMe. So, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the structure is: O

       O
       |
CH3-C-O-C-OCH3 ?

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure correctly. The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, the three carbons are: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH with three carbons: the first is the COOH, then two more. So, positions 1, 2, 3. So, 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But when esterified, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

COOCH3 is the ester group, attached to CH2CH2-OH? Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

The ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OCH3. So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the chain is OCH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

So, the molecule is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, but wait, the ester would have the structure R-O-CO-R'. In this case, R is CH2CH2OH and R' is methyl.

Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is:

The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH of the acid is replaced by OCH3. So, the structure becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3 connected to CH2-CH(OH)-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it:

The molecule has a central carbon (the second carbon) attached to:

- a hydroxyl group (OH)
- a methyl group (CH3) from the ester
- a carbonyl group (COOCH3)
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no, let's count the bonds. Each carbon can have four bonds. So, the structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- a COOCH3 group,
- an OH group,
- a CH3 group (from the ester),
- and another CH2 group? No, wait, perhaps the structure is:

Wait, perhaps the molecule is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3. So, the central carbon is attached to:

- two CH3 groups,
- one OH group,
- one COOCH3 group.

Wait, that can't be right because 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon, which is adjacent to the COO- group.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the second carbon, attached to:

- COOCH3 (from the ester),
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH3? No, wait, that would make four groups. So, the structure is:

      O
      |
CH3-C-O-CO-OCH3?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the molecule as:

It's an ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which would be HOCH2CH2COOH. When esterified, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that would be the structure. So, the molecule is HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

In this case, the central carbons are CH2, CH2, and COOCH3. So, looking for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon attached to four different groups.

In HOCH2CH2COOCH3, the carbons are:

1: COOCH3 (attached to 2 and 3)
2: CH2 connected to 1 and 3, and two H's.
3: CH2 connected to 2 and 4 (the OH), and two H's.
4: OH attached to CH2 connected to 3 and perhaps other structures.

Wait, no. Let me arrange this correctly. The molecule is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3.

Wait, the structure is:

- The first carbon (from the left) is the OH-bearing carbon (CH2OH). Then, a CH2 group connected to the next carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon (COOCH3). So, the carbons are:

1: CH2-OH
2: CH2 connected to 1 and 3
3: C=O connected to 2 and OCH3
OCH3 is the ester group.

So, the central carbon in the chain is the second carbon (CH2), which is connected to:

- CH2-OH (carbon 1)
- two H's
- and carbon 3 (CH2C=O-OCH3).

Wait, but that doesn't make the second carbon a chiral center because it's only connected to two identical groups (the two H's). So, in that case, the second carbon isn't a chiral center.

Looking for any other chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded, so it can't be a chiral center. The ester oxygen isn't a chiral center either.

Wait, but in the structure HOCH2CH2COOCH3, the central CH2 group is -CH2-CH2-, which is symmetric. So, no chiral centers in this molecule. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the structure. Maybe the molecule is different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. That is, the central carbon is the second carbon, attached to:

- OH,
- COOCH3,
- CH3,
- and another CH3? But that would require four different groups. Wait, no, if it's CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH3 (from the right). So, two CH3 groups. So, the groups are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, CH3. So, two identical groups (CH3), so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central CH2 has two H's, so the molecule is not chiral. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the second compound: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumaric acid is a diacid, with two carboxylic acid groups on a two-carbon chain in a trans configuration. Its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but wait, no, wait. No, fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with the structure HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So, the two COOH groups are on either end of a double bond. So, the structure is trans- HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

Dimethyl fumarate would then be the di-ester: (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-COO(CH3O).

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-CO-O
But no, wait, the correct structure is:

The molecule is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where Me is methyl.

Wait, but wait, in fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are on either end of a double bond, so the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH would be succinic acid, but that's saturated. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

So, dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Now, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see.

In the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, each of the double-bonded carbons (CH) is attached to:

- one methyl ester group (OOCCH3),
- one hydrogen,
- and another CH group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is bonded to:

- one COOCH3 group,
- one CH3O,
- and the other central carbon.

Wait, no, perhaps each central carbon is bonded to:

Carbons 1 and 2: for the left double bond carbon (C1), attached to:

- COOCH3 (from the left ester),
- a double bond to C2,
- and perhaps a methyl group.

Wait, no, wait. Let me draw this correctly. The structure is:

      O
      ||
CH3O-C - C - COOCH3
      ||
      O

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3 - CH₂-CH₂ - O=C-OCH3 ?

No, that's not fumaric acid; that's succinic acid derivative, which is a saturated structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between fumaric acid and maleic acid. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, while maleic acid is the cis isomer of the same structure.

So, the structure of fumaric acid is:

HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups? No, wait, no. No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH without a double bond? No, wait no. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the two COOH groups are on either end of a double bond.

So, the structure is:

O
|| 
O-C - C - C-O
|| 
O 

Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH would be succinic acid, which is a saturated molecule. Fumaric acid is the trans dihydroxy form, so it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Now, does this compound have any chiral centers?

Each of the central carbons (the ones involved in the double bond) is attached to:

- one COOCH3 group,
- one H,
- and the other central carbon (double bond).

Wait, but wait, each of the double bond carbons in MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 is bonded to:

- COOCH3,
- another CH (double bond),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but each of these central carbons is double-bonded to the other, so each has only three bonds. So, there are no chiral centers here because the double bond carbons can't have four different groups.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the central carbons are each attached to two substituents. For example, the structure is:

CH2 is replaced by a double bond, so each of the central carbons is connected to:

- COOCH3 (ester group),
- a hydrogen,
- the other central carbon (double bond).

But that makes each of the double bond carbons have two substituents (COOCH3 and H) and the other two bonds are the double bond, so each has only two substituents.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. Each central carbon in the double bond is bonded as follows: one COOCH3 group, one H, and two bonds in the double bond. So, each has two substituents (COOCH3 and H) and the rest are double bonds. So, each of these carbons is bonded to two different groups (COOCH3 and H), and two double bonds to each other. So, each of these carbons is bonded to two different groups and two same groups (the double bond between them). So, each of these is a chiral center?

Wait, no, because a double-bonded carbon can't have four substituents; it has only three. So, each of the central carbons in the double bond is bonded to:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and two bonds in the double bond (so, each has two single bonds and one double bond).

But for a chiral center, the carbon must have four different groups attached. In this case, each central carbon is bonded to:

- COOCH3 (from the ester),
- H,
- two bonds to the other carbon in the double bond.

Wait, but each carbon in the double bond has two bonds to the other carbon. So, it's not clear if this leads to a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is symmetric, so the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers.

Wait, but fumaric acid is a trans-diacid, which suggests that the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When esterified, it's dimethyl fumarate, which is a trans diester. But in terms of chirality, unless there's a chiral center, the molecule can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond. So, perhaps the molecule has E and Z isomerism, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So, in terms of optical activity, we need a chiral center.

Wait, but let me think: does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

In the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, each of the central carbons is bonded to:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and two bonds to the other carbon in the double bond.

So, each of these carbons is bonded to two different groups (COOCH3 and H), and the other two bonds are to each other in the double bond. So, each of these carbons is bonded to two different substituents (COOCH3 and H) and two same substituents (the other central carbon). So, the two substituents on each double-bonded carbon are the same (the other central carbon), so each has two identical substituents. That means each of these carbons doesn't have four different groups; hence, they aren't chiral centers.

Wait, but then, does the molecule have any chiral centers at all? If not, then it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a chiral center elsewhere. Let me look again.

The molecule is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Each end has a COOCH3 group attached to a CH that's part of the double bond.

So, the four substituents on each of the central carbons are:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- CH (double bond),
- and another CH (double bond).

Wait, no, perhaps each central carbon is bonded to:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and two CH groups (double bond).

Wait, but the double bond is between the two central carbons, so each has a double bond to the other. So, each has two substituents besides the double bond.

So, each central carbon has:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and two bonds to the other carbon in the double bond.

That's three substituents, but the fourth is the double bond. So, perhaps each has four substituents, but two are the same.

In any case, each of the double bond carbons is bonded to COOCH3, H, and the other double bond carbon. But wait, the other double bond carbon is bonded to COOCH3 as well. So, in this case, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is bonded to:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and two substituents that are the same (the other double bond carbon).

So, each of these carbons has three different substituents: COOCH3, H, and (CH=).

Wait, but wait, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is bonded to:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and two substituents that are the same (the other double bond carbon).

But for a chiral center, the four substituents must be different. So, if a carbon has two substituents that are the same (like two CH groups), then it's not a chiral center.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, none of the carbons are chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm probably wrong here because I remember that dimethyl fumarate is a chiral compound. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the structure of dimethyl fumarate.

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - C-O-OCH3
But that's succinic acid dimethyl ester, which is a saturated compound and thus not chiral. Wait, but fumarate is the unsaturated version.

Wait, so dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO(OCH3).

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH=CH - CO-OCH3

Wait, perhaps each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to:

- OCOCH3,
- H,
- and the other central carbon (double bond).

So, each of these has three substituents: OCOCH3, H, and the other C.

But wait, each of the central carbons is bonded to two substituents: OCOCH3 and H, and the other substituents are the double bonds. So, each has two substituents and two double bonds, so each has only two substituents besides the double bond. That means each has only two different substituents, so they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, but wait, each of the central carbons is also bonded to another substituent—the other central carbon in the double bond. So, perhaps each has three substituents: OCOCH3, H, and the other C (double bond). So, each has three substituents, but the fourth is the double bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: maybe dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry. If it has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral.

Looking at the structure, if the double bond is trans, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents on either side of the double bond are mirrored, then it's achiral.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on either end of the double bond, and the double bond is trans. So, the structure would look like:

O
|| 
O-C-OCH3 — trans double bond — CO-OCH3
|| 
O 

So, if the groups on either side are mirrored, the molecule might be symmetrical. So, perhaps it's not chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no internal plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about another angle. What about the possibility of cis and trans isomerism, which is geometric isomerism. That's not the same as optical isomerism. So, even if the molecule has geometric isomers, it doesn't necessarily have optical isomers unless there's a chiral center.

Wait, but if a molecule has a chiral center, it can have optical isomerism. If it doesn't have a chiral center, it can't.

So, perhaps neither of these compounds has a chiral center, but that can't be right because the question implies that one of them does.

Wait, wait. Let me think again about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3.

Wait, wait, that's if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- OH,
- two CH3 groups.

Wait, no, that can't be because that would be four substituents. Wait, the second carbon is attached to:

- a CH3 group,
- a COOCH3 group,
- an OH group,
- and another CH3 group.

So, the four substituents are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and CH3. So, two identical substituents (CH3), so that carbon is not a chiral center.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. What if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the one with the OH and the COOCH3 group. So, the substituents are:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group? No.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH (connected to the COOCH3 group).

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me count the bonds again.

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the second carbon. Let's list its substituents:

1. CH3 (from the first carbon),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (the third carbon),
4. and the third carbon is double-bonded to O.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The COOCH3 group is a carbonyl group, so the third carbon is double-bonded to O.

So, the substituents on the second carbon (the one with OH) are:

- CH3 (from first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (third carbon),
- and a single bond to the third carbon (which is double-bonded to O).

Wait, but that would make the second carbon have four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the third carbon. So, let's see if they're all different.

CH3 is a methyl group.

OH is a hydroxyl group.

COOCH3 is an ester group.

And the third carbon is attached via a single bond (but the third carbon is part of the COOCH3 group).

Wait, but the third carbon is a carbonyl carbon (double-bonded to O), so it's a carbon attached to O, but not a substituent in itself.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of it another way. The second carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the third carbon, which is part of the carbonyl group.

But the third carbon is itself a carbonyl group, so perhaps the substituents on the second carbon are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH.

But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the second carbon is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a CH2 group leading to COOCH3.

Wait, that doesn't make sense either.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

If the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center, and the compound would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, what are the four groups attached to the second carbon?

1. CH3 (from the first carbon),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and the third carbon, which is part of the COOCH3 group.

But the third carbon is part of the COOCH3 group, so perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the second carbon's substituents are:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because the second carbon is part of the CH2 group in CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one with OH) has four substituents:

- CH3 (one),
- OH (two),
- COOCH3 (three),
- and another CH (from the CH group in CH(OH)).

Wait, but that doesn't add up. The CH(OH) would have:

- CH3 attached to the left,
- OH attached to the center,
- COOCH3 attached to the right,
- and a hydrogen on the center carbon.

Wait, that can't be because the center carbon can't have four bonds unless it's a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the second carbon has:

- two CH3 groups,
- an OH,
- and a COOCH3.

But that would be:

CH3-C(OH)(CH3)-COOCH3.

No, that would make the second carbon attached to two CH3 groups, so it's not a chiral center.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look up the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as 2-hydroxypropanoic acid methyl ester.

The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

CH3 - C(OH) - COOCH3.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would imply the central carbon is bonded to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and perhaps a hydrogen.

So, the substituents are:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. H.

So, four different groups attached to the central carbon. Therefore, it is a chiral center. Hence, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, that's a different conclusion than earlier. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when considering the structure.

So, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- H.

All four are different, making it a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, earlier I thought that the structure was CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which would have the OH on a CH2 group. So, maybe I got the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the numbering. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain.

So, the three carbons are:

1: COOCH3,
2: OH,
3: CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate has three carbons. The OH is on the second carbon.

So, the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (second carbon) has:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and another CH (from the second carbon's other bond).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second carbon would have three substituents and a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

The second carbon (middle) has:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a hydrogen.

So, four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

In that case, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would exhibit optical isomerism.

But earlier, I thought the structure didn't have a chiral center, so perhaps I was wrong.

So, let me reevaluate: if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, it's a chiral center, so the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but then what about dimethyl fumarate?

Earlier analysis suggested it doesn't have a chiral center, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-dimethyl fumarate, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. Wait, but the structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO(OCH3). So, the central carbons are each attached to:

- OCOCH3,
- H,
- and the other CH in the double bond.

Wait, but in this case, each of the double bond carbons is attached to:

- OCOCH3,
- H,
- and two bonds to the other CH.

So, each of these carbons has two substituents (OCOCH3 and H) and two bonds in the double bond. So, each has two different substituents and two same substituents (the other CH).

Thus, each of these carbons is attached to two identical substituents (the other CH), so they aren't chiral centers.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but then part B would require that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism, which would make the answer for B methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me try to look for another approach.

Let me consult some knowledge: which of these compounds have chiral centers.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon is attached to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, yes, it's a chiral center. Therefore, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral centers, as the double bond carbons each have two substituents (OCOCH3 and H), and the other two bonds are to each other. So, no four different groups; thus, no optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

But wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me double-check.

Another way: look for the presence of a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (the one with OH) has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH (wait, no, perhaps the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H).

Wait, no. Because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (CH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH (from the center),
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and a hydrogen.

So, four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, H. Therefore, it's a chiral center, so the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral centers, as discussed earlier.

So, part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, looking back at the options:

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

But according to my analysis, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, A is the compound that does not show tautomerism. According to earlier analysis, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, so A should be benzoquinone.

So, which option pairs A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate?

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, according to my analysis, part A's answer is benzoquinone (A), and part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so B is correct).

Looking at the options, option B pairs A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism, which would make B correct.

So, the correct option would be option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, so the correct answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the correct option is option B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism requires the presence of an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) that can shift between carbonyl and enol forms. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound consists of a benzene ring with two ketone groups. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring and do not have alpha hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
   
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups have alpha hydrogens, allowing for tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (the second carbon) is bonded to:
   - A methyl group (CH₃),
   - A hydroxyl group (OH),
   - An ester group (COOCH₃),
   - And a hydrogen atom (H).
   Since all four substituents are different, this carbon is a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The double-bonded carbons are each bonded to:
   - An ester group (COOCH₃),
   - A hydrogen atom (H),
   - And two bonds to the other double-bonded carbon.
   These carbons are not chiral centers because they do not have four different substituents. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism),
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.
