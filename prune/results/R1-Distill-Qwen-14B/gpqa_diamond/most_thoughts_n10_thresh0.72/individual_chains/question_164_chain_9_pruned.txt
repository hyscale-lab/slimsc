Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

So the question is about two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses, and their periods are given. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has a period of 1 year. The radial velocity (RV) variations for each system are given as two amplitudes each. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So I need to find the mass ratio, M1_total / M2_total.

Wait, right. I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity curves are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's orbiting a common center of mass closer to it. So the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. But wait, the actual relation is a bit more involved.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K1 = (v1) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Similarly for K2, but K2 = (M1 sin i) / (M2) * K1, I think. Wait, because the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So for system_1, K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s. So K1/K2 = 2. So 2 = M2_1 / M1_1. Wait, because K1/K2 = (M2)/(M1). So 10/5 = M2_1 / M1_1 → 2 = M2_1 / M1_1 → M1_1 = M2_1 / 2.

Hmm, but wait, the sum of the masses is M1_total = M1_1 + M2_1. Since M1_1
