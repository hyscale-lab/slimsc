Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance — the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. But wait, I think the formula for distance using parallax is something like distance equals 1 over parallax, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship.

So, the parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. That means if plx increases, the distance decreases. Wait, no, no, wait—if plx is in arcseconds, then the distance in parsecs is 1 over plx. So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away. A star with 0.5 arcseconds would be 2 parsecs away. So higher parallax means closer.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So they're asking, as plx changes, how does the count of stars per unit range of plx change. Let's think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that would mean that their number per volume is constant. But the way we observe them depends on their distance.

Wait, no, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So I think it's a uniform spatial distribution, not just on the sky's surface. So number density is uniform. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume.

But how does that translate to parallax? Because parallax depends
