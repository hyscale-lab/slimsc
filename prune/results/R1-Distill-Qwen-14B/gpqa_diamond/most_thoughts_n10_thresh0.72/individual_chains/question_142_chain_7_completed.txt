Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. So, this ρ must be a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The formula given is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Each of these terms is a projector into the respective basis states. So this is like taking the average of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. Because 1/2 is the coefficient, so each has a probability of 1/2. That makes sense because a density matrix for a mixed state is a convex combination of projectors.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, what does that mean? Oh right, I think in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on or inside a unit sphere. For pure states, it's on the surface; for mixed states, it's inside.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is something like ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So, I should express the given ρ in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices to find the Bloch vector r.

Let me write down the given ρ again: (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let's compute each term. |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]] which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I. 

Wait, but the identity matrix divided by 2 is the density matrix when the state is completely mixed. In the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is at the origin because r is zero. Because the general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2. If r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero, then ρ is (I)/2.

So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0). Let me check the options. Option C is (0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure. For a pure state |0>, the density matrix is |0><0|, which is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Its Bloch vector is (0,0,1), because in the Bloch sphere representation, |0> is at the north pole. Similarly, |1> is at the south pole (0,0,-1). If I take the completely mixed state, it's the average of |0> and |1>, so in terms of the Bloch sphere, that should bring it to the center because each contributes equally but in opposite directions.

So yes, r is the zero vector. So the answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, which is a statistical mixture of the basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single-qubit state, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. 

For the given \(\rho\), we compute \(|0\rangle \langle 0|\) as the matrix \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(|1\rangle \langle 1|\) as \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\). Adding these matrices gives the identity matrix \(I\), so \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, where the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is zero because there is no directional preference in the Bloch sphere. 

Thus, the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the vector \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
