Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, let's think through this. I'm a bit rusty on my virology, but I'll try to piece it together.

Retroviruses are RNA viruses, right? They have an RNA genome and use reverse transcriptase to make DNA from RNA. So when designing a diagnostic test, what would be the best approach?

The question is about choosing the correct method. The options are A, B, C, D. Each suggests different steps.

Option A says to identify the virus using symptoms and then do nested PCR. Wait, but symptoms can vary and might not be reliable for quick identification. Also, nested PCR is good for amplifying specific regions but maybe not the first choice for initial identification? Or is it?

Option B suggests cDNA sequencing first. Oh right, since it's a retrovirus, its genome is RNA. So the first step would be to make cDNA from the virus's RNA. Once you have the cDNA, you can sequence it to identify the virus. Then, using real-time PCR would allow for quick and accurate diagnosis because real-time PCR can quantify the amount of DNA and is faster than traditional methods.

Option C says DNA sequencing. Wait, but the virus is RNA-based. So you can't directly do DNA sequencing on the virus. Unless they're talking about host DNA, which doesn't make sense for identifying the virus itself. So C is probably incorrect because it starts with DNA sequencing, which isn't the right approach for an RNA virus like a retrovirus.

Option D is about IgG antibodies and ELISA. ELISA tests detect antibodies, which the body produces in response to the virus. But if it's a new outbreak, maybe many people are in the early stages of infection where antibodies haven't developed yet. Also, ELISA can be less specific unless you have the right antibodies, which might not be readily available for a new virus. Plus, the question is about designing a kit for quick detection, and PCR-based methods are usually faster and more direct for detecting the pathogen itself rather than antibodies.

So putting it together: since it's a retrovirus, we need to work with RNA. The first step would be to convert RNA to cDNA. Then, using real-time PCR on that cDNA would allow for quick and accurate detection. So option B seems correct.

Wait, but why not option A? Nested PCR is a method to amplify specific DNA regions, but I think real-time PCR is more efficient and gives quantifiable results. Also, without knowing the exact target sequence from the virus, how would you design the nested PCR primers? So you have to first identify the virus's genetic sequence, which would require cDNA sequencing first.

So the correct process is: identify the virus via cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit. That points to option B.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is important to consider the nature of retroviruses, which are RNA viruses. The first step is to identify the virus by converting its RNA into cDNA using reverse transcriptase, as RNA cannot be directly sequenced. Once cDNA is obtained, sequencing can be performed to characterize the virus. Real-time PCR is then the most suitable method for quick and accurate diagnosis, as it allows for the detection and quantification of specific DNA sequences in a fast and efficient manner.

Option A suggests using nested PCR based on symptoms, but symptoms can be unreliable and variable, and nested PCR is not the most efficient method for initial identification. Option C proposes DNA sequencing, but this is not applicable to RNA viruses like retroviruses. Option D focuses on detecting IgG antibodies using ELISA, but antibody tests may not be ideal for a new outbreak due to potential delays in antibody development and the need for specific reagents. Therefore, the correct approach is to first identify the virus through cDNA sequencing and then develop a real-time PCR kit for rapid and accurate diagnosis.

Answer: B
