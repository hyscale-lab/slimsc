Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let me think. I remember that stability constants (beta) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more the complex will form. So in this case, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, the problem says the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The beta values given are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. So these are the stability constants for Co(II) thiocyanate complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ions respectively.

I think the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ions, which would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Because I remember that Co with two SCN is usually blue. But wait, I'm not entirely certain; sometimes different complexes can have different colors. But I'll proceed with that assumption.

So, the total cobalt species include Co^2+ (free ion), and all the complexes from 1 to 4 SCN- attached. The sum of all these species should add up to the total concentration of Co, which is 1e-2 M. 

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ species. So I need to find the fraction of this species relative to all possible cobalt species.

The approach I think is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. Since the solution has SCN- present, the complexes will form based on the beta values and the concentrations.

Let me recall the formula for the fraction of a complex. The fraction f_n for the nth complex is given by (beta_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / (denominator), where the denominator is the sum over all possible complexes of (beta_k [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^k) for k from 0 to 4.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is not the same in each term because as complexes form, the free [Co^2+] decreases. Oh wait, no, wait. Because in the denominator, it's the sum of all the terms, each term being beta_k multiplied by [Co^2+] times [SCN^-]^k, but [Co^2+] is the same for each term because it's the free ion. So actually, [Co^2+] can be factored out. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another way to think about it: the fraction for each complex is proportional to beta_n [SCN^-]^n divided by the sum over all k of beta_k [SCN^-]^k. Because the [Co^2+] is the same for all terms and cancels out when taking the ratio.

Wait, no, because [Co^2+] is the total concentration minus the sum of all complexes, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps we can treat the free [Co^2+] as a variable. Hmm, perhaps we can use the method where the fraction of each complex is determined by the ratio of each beta multiplied by the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands, divided by the sum of all such terms.

Wait, I think I've learned that in such cases, the fraction of each species can be approximated using the formula:

fraction_n = (beta_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 beta_k [SCN^-]^k)

But wait, what's the [SCN^-] in this context? Because when the complexes form, the concentration of free SCN^- decreases. Oh, wait, but the problem says the initial concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M. But since the complexes form, the free SCN^- will be less. So this approach might not be accurate. Hmm, perhaps we can assume that the concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M because it's in excess. Because the total [Co] is 0.01 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is 10 times higher. So maybe the concentration of SCN^- doesn't change much, and we can approximate it as 0.1 M.

That would make the math easier. So let's proceed under that assumption.

So, for each complex, the numerator term is beta_k multiplied by [SCN^-]^k. So for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), it's beta_2 * (0.1)^2.

But wait, the denominator would be the sum of beta_k * (0.1)^k for k=0 to 4.

Wait, beta_0 would be 1, because it's the free ion. Because for k=0, the complex is just Co^2+ with no ligands, so the formation
