Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So the complex would be Co(SCN)₂²+. But wait, the stability constants go up to β4=16, so maybe the complexes can have up to four SCN ligands? Because βn usually refers to the formation of the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-? Or maybe I'm mixing up the charges here.

Wait, Co(II) is +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for each complex: [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 - n}, because each SCN brings -1. So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), n=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^(0), n=3: [Co(SCN)3]^-1, n=4: [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

But in the problem, the blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the [Co(SCN)2] complex. So the question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)₂^0 in the solution.

Now, the problem is about the distribution of cobalt species in solution. So I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then sum the percentages for each. The question specifically asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)_2^0.

Stability constants, β, are given for each complex. The stability constant (formation constant) Kf is given by β. So for a complex [Co(SCN)n]^{charge}, the formation constant is βn.

I remember that the fraction of each species can be determined using the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand. The formula involves the formation constant, the number of ligands, and the concentrations.

The general approach is to compute the fraction of each complex using the expression:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, not quite. Because each complex formation is stepwise, but sometimes people model it as the overall formation. Alternatively, we can think of it as the fraction of each complex is given by (βn [SCN]^n) / denominator, where denominator sums all possible βk [SCN]^k plus 1 (for the free ion, maybe? Or does 1 represent the free Co²+ plus all the complexes? Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Hmm, I think the correct formula is that the fraction of the nth complex is (βn [L]^n) divided by the sum of (βk [L]^k) for k from 0 to 4, where β0 is 1 (for the free Co²+). Wait, no, wait, β0 isn't given. Oh, right, the free ion is Co²+ which doesn't have any ligand. So the denominator is 1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4.

Wait, no, wait. Because the formation is stepwise, the fractions can be calculated using the ratios of the successive terms. Alternatively, the fraction f_n is (β_n [L]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to max} β_k [L]^k ), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Each stability constant is for the formation of the complex from the previous ion. For example, β1 is for Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+; β2 is for [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)₂]^0, and so on. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is the product of the stepwise β's up to n. Wait no, each βn is the overall stability constant for the formation of the nth complex. So for [Co(SCN)_n], βn is the constant for Co²+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me clarify. The problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each βn is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth SCN^- ion. Or are they the overall constants? I think in the problem, each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, it's the stability constants of the complexes. So for [Co(SCN)]^+, β1=9; for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β2=40; for [Co(SCN)3]^-1, β3=63; and for [Co(SCN)4]^2-, β4=16. So each βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands.

So the fraction of each species is given by (βn [SCN]^n) divided by the sum over all species (including the free ion) of (βk [SCN]^k) where k is the number of ligands attached.

Wait, but the free Co²+ is when n=0. So β0 is 1, because the free ion is just Co²+. So the denominator is sum_{k=0 to 4} βk [SCN]^k, where β0=1.

So the fraction of each complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / denominator, where denominator is 1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4.

So let's compute each term. Let's compute the numerator for each n and the denominator.

Given [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. Let me plug in the numbers.

Compute each term:

n=0: β0=1, term is 1*(0.1)^0 =1*1=1.

n=1: β1=9, term is 9*(0.1)^1 =9*0.1=0.9.

n=2: β2=40, term=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3=63, term=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4=16, term=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So the denominator is sum of all these terms:

denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016.

Let me add them up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.

So denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, each fraction f_n is (term_n) / denominator.

So for n=2, which is the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)₂^0), the term is 0.4.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that. 0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Let me do this division. 0.4 ÷ 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

Wait, approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So that's the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches this. But wait, let me double-check. Did I miss any terms?

Wait, what's the order of the terms? Did I compute each correctly?

n=0: 1 *1 =1.

n=1:9 *0.1 =0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646. Correct.

So f_2 is 0.4/2.3646. Let me compute more accurately.

0.4 / 2.3646.

2.3646 is about 2.3646.

Dividing 0.4 by 2.3646:

Well, 0.4 ÷2.3646 ≈ 0.1692, which is 16.92% approximately. So about 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. Could there be a miscalculation? Because sometimes people get confused between the overall stability constants and the stepwise ones. Wait, in this problem, the stability constants given are for the complexes with n ligands. So the formula I used is correct.

Alternatively, I remember that sometimes when the ligand concentration is high, higher complexes are favored. Let me check the [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is 0.1. Let's see, the higher βn may favor higher n.

Looking at the βn:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So the β increases up to n=3, then drops at n=4. So the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)3]^-1, with β3=63.

So the highest term in the denominator (i.e., the dominant species) would be n=3, because 63*(0.1)^3 = 0.063. But wait, n=2 is 40*(0.01)=0.4, which is larger than n=3's 0.063. Hmm, so n=2 is larger. But wait, 0.4 is bigger than 0.063. So the denominator is dominated by n=0 (1), n=1 (0.9), and n=2 (0.4), which are the main contributors.

Wait, so the highest term is n=0 (1), then n=1 (0.9), then n=2 (0.4), then n=3 (0.063), then n=4 (0.0016). So the dominant species are the free ion (1), the monomeric complex ([CoSCN]^+), and the dithiocyanato complex. So the dithiocyanato is the third most.

But the question is only about the percentage of the dithiocyanato, which is 16.9% according to the calculation. So option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me recheck the denominator.

Wait, denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646. Correct.

So f_2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.1692, or 16.92%, which is option D. So the answer should be D. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought perhaps the blue color is associated with [Co(SCN)3]^-1 or another complex. Wait, I've heard that the blue color is for the tetraammine dithiocyanato complex, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe [Co(SCN)₂]^(0) is blue.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, another way: let me compute all the fractions:

f_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423. So about 42.3%.

f_1 = 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.381, so 38.1%.

f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 16.9%.

f_3 = 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 2.66%.

f_4 = 0.0016 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0677%, about 0.07%.

So the percentages are:

n=0: ~42.3%,

n=1: ~38.1%,

n=2: ~16.9%,

n=3: ~2.66%,

n=4: ~0.07%.

So the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, so 16.9% (option D). But wait, option C is 38.1%, which is f_1. So if the dithiocyanato is n=2, then option D is correct.

But wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato", which implies two SCN ligands. So it's n=2. So the answer is 16.9% (option D).

Hmm, but wait, the options have option C as 38.1%, which is f_1's value. So if the problem was about the monomeric complex, that would be option C. But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is n=2.

So the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, corresponding to the complexes [CoSCN]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, respectively. The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\text{Denominator}}
\]

where the denominator is:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

Given \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), we compute each term:

- For \(n = 0\): \(f_0 = \frac{1}{\text{Denominator}}\), where the term is \(1 \cdot (0.1)^0 = 1\).
- For \(n = 1\): \(f_1 = \frac{\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]}{\text{Denominator}} = 9 \cdot (0.1)^1 = 0.9\).
- For \(n = 2\): \(f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4\).
- For \(n = 3\): \(f_3 = \frac{\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3}{\text{Denominator}} = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063\).
- For \(n = 4\): \(f_4 = \frac{\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}{\text{Denominator}} = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016\).

The denominator is the sum of all terms:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, \(f_2\), is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1692
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.92\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
