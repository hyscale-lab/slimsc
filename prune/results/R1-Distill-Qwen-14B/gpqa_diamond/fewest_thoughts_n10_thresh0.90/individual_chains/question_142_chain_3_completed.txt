Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (so not a pure state). A pure state would have a density matrix like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this one is a bit different.

Wait, I think that if a density matrix is a mixture of two orthonormal states, it's called a classical mixture. So this ρ is a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities. Each term is |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, each multiplied by 1/2. So ρ = 0.5|0⟩⟨0| + 0.5|1⟩⟨1|. That looks like a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm trying to remember how density matrices are represented geometrically. I think for a single qubit, the space of density matrices is 3-dimensional because a qubit state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector describes the state in terms of coordinates (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to a Pauli matrix.

Wait, for a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and the Bloch vector is (2Re(ψ₁ψ₀*), 2Im(ψ₁ψ₀*), |ψ₁|² - |ψ₀|²). But this is for a pure state. For a mixed state, the representation might be different.

But how does this apply to the given ρ? Let's compute it. Let me expand ρ:

|0⟩ is (1, 0) and |1⟩ is (0, 1). So |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

So ρ is (1/2) [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. That's a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal.

I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So if I can write ρ in that form, I can find the r vector.

Given that ρ = (I)/2, let's see. Comparing with the general form:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2
Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ
Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ

Which implies that r·σ must be zero. So the Bloch vector r must be zero. Because if r is (0,0,0), then r·σ is zero, and ρ is I/2, which matches what we have.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which corresponds to the origin in the 3D space. Thus, the geometrical position is at the origin.

Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → No, that would mean some Bloch vector in x and y, but our r is zero.

B) (0,0,1) → That's along the z-axis. But our r is zero.

C) (0,0,0) → Yes, that matches.

D) (1,1,1) → No.

So the correct answer is option C, r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit, where the system has equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). The density matrix can also be written as \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix.

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Therefore, the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a non-zero Bloch vector.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a Bloch vector along the \(z\)-axis.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** Correct, as this matches the origin of the Bloch sphere.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a non-zero Bloch vector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
