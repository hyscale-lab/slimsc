Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, let's see what I remember about density matrices. I think a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. In this case, the matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. 

So, for a single qubit, the state can be represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But wait, what's the Bloch vector for this particular density matrix?

I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). 

Let me expand this. The identity matrix I is 2x2 and the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are also 2x2. So, ρ in the question is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute |0⟩⟨0|. That's a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. Adding them gives a matrix with 1 and 1 on the diagonal, so when multiplied by 1/2, it's [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2.

Wait, but the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set ρ equal to I/2, that would mean that r·σ must be zero. Because I/2 = (I + 0)/2. So the vector r must be zero. Because any component of r would contribute a non-zero multiple of the Pauli matrices, which would modify the off-diagonal terms or add some terms. But our ρ has only diagonal terms, and they are equal.

So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0), right? Because the z-component (since σz is diagonal) would affect the diagonal terms. Wait, let's think again. The diagonal elements are (1 + σz)/2. So if ρ is (I + r_z σz)/2, then the diagonal elements are [1 + r_z * σz]/2. σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the diagonal entries are (1 + r_z *1)/2 and (1 + r_z * (-1))/2. For the density matrix to have both diagonal elements equal (as in this case, 0.5 each), we can set these equal:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z=0.

Similarly, the off-diagonal terms are (r_x σx + r_y σy)/2. Since σx is [[0,1],[1,0]] and σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], the off-diagonal terms would be (r_x (1)/2) and (r_y (-i)/2) for the top-right element. But in our given ρ, the off-diagonal terms are zero. So for the top-right element to be zero, both r_x and r_y must be zero, because otherwise we'd have terms like r_x/2 and (-i r_y)/2. So setting them to zero implies r_x=0 and r_y=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. So in the qubit space, this is the completely mixed state, meaning it's the maximally uncertain state.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right|\right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit can be described by a Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \), where the density matrix is expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\right),
\]

with \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) being the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms are equal, indicating that the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) must be zero. This is because the off-diagonal terms depend on \( r_x \) and \( r_y \), which must both be zero to match the zero off-diagonal elements. Similarly, the diagonal terms depend on \( r_z \), which must also be zero to ensure the diagonal elements are equal. Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

**A) \( r = (1,1,0) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) \( r = (0,0,1) \):** Incorrect, as this would imply a diagonal density matrix but with a non-zero \( r_z \).  
**C) \( r = (0,0,0) \):** Correct, as this matches the origin in the Bloch sphere for the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \( r = (1,1,1) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Answer: C
