Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the spectral data provided. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, plugging in the numbers: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That usually means either a combination of rings and double bonds. Since we have a benzene ring, that accounts for 4 (since benzene is 3 double bonds). So the fifth would be another double bond or a ring. But looking at the IR, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide or something similar.

Looking at the IR data: the medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are typically N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or amine. But wait, if it's a strong band, amide N-H would be around 3300-3500. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely an ester carbonyl (since amide carbonyl is usually a bit lower, maybe around 1650). Or maybe a ketone, but less likely with the other data.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – that's a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2, which is common for ethyl groups attached to something else, like O or N.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. That might be an OCH2 group or maybe an N attached to CH2, but considering the other peaks, perhaps part of an ester or amide.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – quartet, 2H. That sounds like another CH2 group adjacent to an O, maybe an ester's OCH2. The quartet suggests coupling to a CH2CH3, which would match the 1.20 ppm triplet.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) – these are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, like para-substituted benzene. The lower field (8.0 ppm) suggests electron-withdrawing groups. If it's a carbonyl group attached, like in a benzoate ester or amide, that makes sense.

Putting this together, the structure probably has a benzene ring with a substituent that has an ester group. Let's think about the options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Benzamide would have a CONH2 group. But IR shows a peak at 1720, which is more like an ester. Also, benzamide's amide would have a carbonyl around 1650, which doesn't match.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So, formamide would be HCONR2. The structure would have a formamide group attached to a 4-ethoxy phenyl. The carbonyl in formamide is around 1680-1700, but the IR here is at 1720, which is higher, so more like an ester. Also, formamide would have N-H around 3000-3300, which would probably show as a strong peak, maybe similar to the given data.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no: propionate is CH2CH2COO- attached to something. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would have the structure where propionate ester is attached to the benzene ring at para to an amine group. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C9H11NO2? Propionate is CH2CH2COO- plus the benzene (C6H4) and NH2. Let me check:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's the propionate ester, perhaps it's O-CO-OEt or similar. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the structure would be NH2-C6H4-CH2CH2COO-. Wait, if the propionate is attached as an ester, like O-CO-O-R. Alternatively, maybe it's an amino attached to benzene, and a propionyl group attached as an ester.

But let me calculate the formula. Benzene ring (6C), ethyl group (2C), the propionate part is CH2CH2COO- (3C, but as an ester, perhaps OCH2CH2COO-). Wait, no. Let me think: the propionate ester is CH2CH2COO-R. So if R is ethyl, then the ester would be ethyl propionate, which is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. But the compound in question is 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be NH2-C6H4-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is -COOEt (if ester) or -COOH if acid. So in the ester case, it's O-CO-OEt attached to the benzene? Wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally.

Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be benzene with NH2 at para, and a propionyl-O group attached. So the structure is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene, and NH2 at para. Wait, but that would make the formula C9H11NO2. Let me see: benzene (6C) + propionyl (3C) + ethyl (2C if ester) – no, wait, propionate ester would be O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. So the ester is from propionic acid (CH2CH2COOH) and ethanol (CH2CH3OH). So the ester group would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that makes the propionate ester larger. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is shorter.

Wait, perhaps the structure is N-ethyl something. Let me think again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be the benzoate ester with an ethyl group, and an amine on the benzene ring. The structure would be O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring at para position to NH2.

So the formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the benzoate is C7H5O2 (if
