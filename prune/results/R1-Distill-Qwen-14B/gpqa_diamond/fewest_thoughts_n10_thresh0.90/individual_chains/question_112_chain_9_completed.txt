Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's parse the problem.

First, the state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, I think I need to normalize this state first because the coefficients are complex numbers. Oh wait, maybe I should first write it as a vector and then normalize.

Wait, the problem says it's proportional, so I should probably calculate the normalization factor. The normalization condition is that the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients equals 1.

So, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i) for |up> and |down>, respectively. Let me compute their magnitudes.

The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). For (2 - i), it's sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5). So the squared magnitudes are 2 and 5, respectively.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, the state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, so the coefficients are (1+i) and (2 -i). So the squared magnitudes are |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, and |2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> divided by sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Okay, now the operator's matrix elements are given. The operator A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because we are dealing with spin-up and spin-down states. So the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because when i ≠ j, A_ij is ħ/2. So the diagonal elements are 0. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. Hmm, what kind of operator is this? It looks like it's a spin operator in the x or y direction or something else. Or maybe it's related to the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So perhaps this operator is a scaled version of X. Let me think: The given operator A has elements (ħ/2) for i≠j. So scaling the Pauli X matrix by ħ/2 gives exactly this. So A = (ħ/2) * X, where X is the Pauli X matrix.

But wait, wait. The Pauli X matrix has 1s off-diagonal. So A_ij is (ħ/2) when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So yes, A = (ħ/2) * sigma_x.

So the operator A is proportional to sigma_x.

Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. Wait, but the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of sigma_x, right? Because A is a multiple of sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of A, which is the |+x> and |-x> states.

But wait, alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x. So I can find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

But perhaps another approach is better. The operator A is (ħ/2)(sigma_x), so its eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2). The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which can be expressed in terms of |up> and |down>.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Right, because sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, etc.

So to find the probabilities, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of A and the probabilities for the eigenstates by using the given state |alpha>.

Wait, but the question says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A. So each eigenstate would have a certain probability, and the expectation value is the average value of A.

Wait, but the operator A's eigenvalues are eigenvalues of sigma_x multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A are ±(ħ/2).

Wait, no, no. Wait, sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1)= - ħ/2.

But the question says, calculate the probability of measuring each eigenstate of the operator. Wait, but the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the probabilities are the square of the coefficients when expressing |alpha> in terms of these states.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another way is to calculate the expectation value of A, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But the problem says to find the average value, which is the expectation value of A. So I need to compute <A>.

Wait, but perhaps first, I should find the probability for each eigenstate. Let me outline the steps:

1. Express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, which is the x basis. The coefficients' squares give the probabilities for each eigenstate.

2. The average value is the expectation value <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, and sigma_x is Hermitian, so the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) <sigma_x>, which is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in the state |alpha>.

But I think working in the x basis might be easier.

Wait, perhaps to proceed, I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, I can express |alpha> as a combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

To find c_+ and c_-, we take inner products.

c_+ = < +x | alpha >, and c_- = < -x | alpha >.

But first, let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>.

We have:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

Then,

c_+ = < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So,

c_+ = 1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 1 ]

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Simplify numerator: 1+2 + i -i = 3. So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c_- = < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So,

c_- = 1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) * (-1) ]

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (1 -2) + (i +i) ] / sqrt(14)
= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

So the coefficients are c_+ = 3/sqrt(14), and c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation for c_+.

Wait, < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) because sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)=sqrt(14).

Yes, 1+i plus 2 -i is 3, so c_+ is 3/sqrt(14).

For c_-, let me recheck. The expression is (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 + i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i. So yes, c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Calculating |c_+|^2:

(3)^2 / (sqrt(14))^2 )= 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64. So that's one of the options.

|c_-|^2 is | (-1 +2i) |^2 / (14).

The numerator is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but 9+5=14, which makes sense.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but let me compute 9/14 and 5/14 exactly.

9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So that would match option A.

But wait, the question also asks for the average value of the operator. So let's compute <A>.

Since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) < sigma_x >.

Alternatively, since the operator A has eigenvalues ±(ħ/2), the expectation value is sum (p_i * lambda_i) = p_+ (ħ/2) + p_- (-ħ/2) = (p_+ - p_-) (ħ/2).

But p_+ is 9/14, p_- is 5/14.

So (9/14 -5/14) =4/14 =2/7.

Multiply by ħ/2: (2/7) * (ħ/2) )= ħ/7.

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A has average value ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average is ħ/7. So option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the expectation value.

Alternatively, <A> = < alpha | A | alpha >.

Because A is (ħ/2) times sigma_x, so this is (ħ/2) < alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

But sigma_x is the Pauli matrix, and <sigma_x> is the expectation value.

We can compute <sigma_x> as:

Since |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So,

< sigma_x > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) <up| + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) <down| ] * sigma_x * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Compute this:

= (1/7) [ (1+i)* <up| sigma_x (1+i)|up> + (1+i)* <up| sigma_x (2 -i)|down> + (2 -i)* <down| sigma_x (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)*(2 -i)^* <down| sigma_x |down> ]

Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>.

So,

sigma_x |up> = |down>
sigma_x |down> = |up>

So,

< sigma_x > = (1/7) [ (1+i)(2 -i)^* + (2 -i)(1+i)^* ]

Because when you expand, the cross terms will involve <up| down> and <down| up>, which are zero? Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, sigma_x |alpha> is [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Then, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, it's ( (1+i)(2 -i) + (2 -i)(1+i) ) /7.

Wait, actually, let me compute it properly.

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )^* * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) + ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^* * (1+i)/sqrt(7) )

Because sigma_x swaps the components. So the first term is ( (1+i)^* ) (2 -i) /7, and the second term is ( (2 -i)^* ) (1+i) /7.

So let's compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i^2 = 2 +2i +i -1 = (2-1) +3i = 1 +3i.

So adding the two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So <sigma_x> = 2 /7.

Thus, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So that matches the previous calculation.

So the average value is ħ/7, and probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the options are:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) and finding the average value of \( A \) for a given quantum state \( |\alpha\rangle \). The state is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has a matrix representation with elements \( A_{ij} = \hbar/2 \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise, which corresponds to \( A = (\hbar/2)\sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \) are \( (1+i) \) and \( (2-i) \). The magnitudes of these coefficients are:
\[
|(1+i)|^2 = 2, \quad |(2-i)|^2 = 5.
\]
The normalization factor is \( \sqrt{2+5} = \sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenbasis of \( A \)
The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Expanding \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the coefficients:
\[
c_+ = \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the average value of \( A \)
The operator \( A = (\hbar/2)\sigma_x \). The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha|\sigma_x|\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using \( \sigma_x |\uparrow\rangle = |\downarrow\rangle \) and \( \sigma_x |\downarrow\rangle = |\uparrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{(1+i)(2-i) + (2-i)(1+i)}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). This matches **Option A**.
