Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stability constants and complex formation. But let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what do I remember about stability constants? Oh right, stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. Each β corresponds to a different complex. The numbering goes from the simplest to more complex, I think. So β1 is probably for Co(SCN)-, β2 for Co(SCN)2^2+, and so on.

Wait, the problem mentions "dithiocyanato" complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- per Co^2+. So maybe that's the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex, which would be the second β. But wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the order.

Wait, actually, the stability constants are given in order β1, β2, β3, β4. So the complexes are Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4. So each β corresponds to the number of SCN- attached.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. So dithiocyanato is two SCN- ions. So we're looking for [Co(SCN)2]^2+.

So our goal is to find the fraction of all cobalt species that is [Co(SCN)2]^2+. The total cobalt is 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all the species: Co^2+, CoSCN^-, Co(SCN)2^2+, Co(SCN)3^3-, and Co(SCN)4^4-.

Wait, but how do we calculate the distribution of each species? I think we need to use the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand to determine each species' concentration.

The general formula for the fraction of each species is based on the stability constants and the ligand concentration. I remember something about the formation of complexes being a stepwise process, so each step's constant is the ratio of the next complex to the previous one.

Wait, the stability constant β for a complex is given by the formula:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}]/([Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n)

So for each n, the concentration of the complex is β_n multiplied by [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But wait, since the formation is stepwise, the overall β would be the product of each step's β. Or is β given as the overall stability constant for the entire complex? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16." So each β represents the overall stability constant for the entire complex. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, because n=1. β2 is for [Co(SCN)2]^2+ because n=2, and so on.

Wait, but wait a second. For each complex, the formula would be:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n)

So for n=1: β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

For n=2: β2 = [Co(SCN)2^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)

And so on.

But since the formation is stepwise, the overall β for the complex [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of β1, β2, ..., βn. Wait, no, that can't be right because the given β's are already for each n. Wait, no, perhaps the given β's are the cumulative stability constants.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The stability constant β for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its constituent ions. For a general complex [M(L)n], the stability constant β is:

β = [MLn]/([M][L]^n)

So for each n, the given β is that for the specific complex. So, to find the concentration of each complex, we can use these βs.

But the problem is that the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. So each βn is the equilibrium constant for adding the nth ligand. Or wait, perhaps the given βs are the overall β for each complex, which includes all the steps up to that point.

Wait, wait, if the β's provided are for the successive complexes, then for [Co(SCN)]^+, β1 is 9. For [Co(SCN)2]^2+, β2 is 40, and so on.

So the formation is stepwise. So the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^- would have a β of 9. Then the formation of [Co(SCN)2]^2+ from [CoSCN]^+ and another SCN^- would have a β of 40/β1? Wait, no, perhaps each βn is the stepwise constant. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall β for each complex is the product of the previous βs. For example, β1 for n=1, β1*β2 for n=2. But that doesn't make sense because the given β2 is 40, which is larger than β1=9. So if β for n=2 is β1 * β2_step, where β2_step is the stepwise constant for adding the second SCN^-.

Alternatively, perhaps each βn represents the cumulative stability constant up to that n. So β1=9 for n=1, β2=40 for n=2, β3=63 for n=3, β4=16 for n=4.

Wait, but the fourth complex has a lower β (16) than the third (63). So the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)3]^3- with β3=63, and the next one, [Co(SCN)4]^4-, is less stable, with β4=16. That makes sense because each additional ligand might make the complex less stable beyond a point.

But how do we calculate the concentrations of each species?

I think the way to approach this is to use the distribution of the complexes based on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The general approach is to assume that the concentration of each complex is proportional to the product of the stability constant for that complex and the ligand concentration raised to the power of n (the number of ligands in the complex), divided by the product of all the previous β's.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the method of successive approximations or find the fractions using the relative log β and the ligand concentrations.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the fraction of each complex, which involves the log of the stability constant and the ligand concentration.

Wait, the fraction f_n of each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (β_total)

where β_total is the sum over all possible m of (β_m * [SCN^-]^m)

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because each β_n is the overall stability constant for that complex. So the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is part of each expression, so we can factor that out.

Let’s denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentrations of each complex are:

[CoSCN+] = β1 x [SCN] = 9 x (0.1) = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)2^2+] = β2 x [SCN]^2 = 40 x (0.1)^2 = 4 x

[Co(SCN)3^3-] = β3 x [SCN]^3 = 63 x (0.1)^3 = 0.63 x

[Co(SCN)4^4-] = β4 x [SCN]^4 = 16 x (0.1)^4 = 0.016 x

And the concentration of free Co^2+ is x.

Wait, but wait, what about the other way? Because each complex formation is a stepwise process, but in the given problem, each βn is the stepwise or the overall stability constant?

Hmm, this is where I'm getting stuck. If the βn are stepwise constants, then this approach would be correct. But if they are overall constants, perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, perhaps each βn is the overall stability constant, meaning that:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n)

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

In this case, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] plus [Co^2+].

So, total [Co] = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)2^2+] + [Co(SCN)3^3-] + [Co(SCN)4^4-] = 1e-2 M.

Let me plug in the expressions:

[Co] = x + (β1 x [SCN]^1) + (β2 x [SCN]^2) + (β3 x [SCN]^3) + (β4 x [SCN]^4) = 1e-2

So substituting the numbers:

x + (9 x * 0.1) + (40 x * 0.01) + (63 x * 0.001) + (16 x * 0.0001) = 1e-2

Let's compute each term:

x

9x * 0.1 = 0.9x

40x * 0.01 = 0.4x

63x * 0.001 = 0.063x

16x * 0.0001 = 0.0016x

Adding all these:

x + 0.9x = 1.9x

1.9x + 0.4x = 2.3x

2.3x + 0.063x = 2.363x

2.363x + 0.0016x ≈ 2.3646x

So:

2.3646x = 1e-2

x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.223e-3

So [Co^2+] is x ≈ 4.223e-3 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN+] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 9 * 4.223e-3 * 0.1 = 3.79e-4 M

[Co(SCN)2^2+] = 40 * x * 0.01 = 40 *4.223e-3 * 0.01 = 1.689e-4 M

Wait, wait a second, that can't be right. Because 40 *0.01 is 0.4, so 0.4 *4.223e-3 = 1.689e-3 M? Wait, wait, let me recompute:

Wait, [Co(SCN)2^2+] is β2 * x * [SCN]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2.

So 0.1 squared is 0.01. So 40 * x * 0.01 = 40 * 4.223e-3 * 0.01.

Wait, 40 * 4.223e-3 is 0.16892, multiplied by 0.01 gives 0.0016892, which is 1.6892e-3 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3^3-] = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 → 63 *4.223e-3 * 0.001 = 63 *4.223e-6 = 2.661e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)4^4-] =16 * x * (0.1)^4 → 16 *4.223e-3 * 0.0001 =16 *4.223e-7 = 6.757e-6 M.

So now, let's sum all the concentrations to confirm they add up to 1e-2:

x ≈4.223e-3 = 0.004223

[CoSCN+] ≈3.79e-4=0.000379

[Co(SCN)2^2+] ≈1.689e-3=0.001689

[Co(SCN)3^3-] ≈2.661e-4=0.0002661

[Co(SCN)4^4-]≈6.757e-6≈0.000006757

Adding these:

0.004223 + 0.000379 = 0.004602

+0.001689 → 0.006291

+0.0002661 → 0.006557

+0.000006757 → ~0.006564, which is about 6.56e-3.

Wait, but the total cobalt concentration is supposed to be 1e-2 (0.01 M). So 6.56e-3 is less than that. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, this suggests that the assumption that βn are overall constants is incorrect. Because when I calculate the sum, it doesn't add up to 1e-2. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the βn are the stepwise constants. So each βn is the constant for adding the nth ligand, not the overall. So for example, β1 is the formation of [CoSCN+] from Co^2+ and SCN^-, β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)2^2+] from [CoSCN+] and SCN^-, etc.

In that case, the overall β for each complex would be the product of the stepwise βs up to that point.

So, for [CoSCN+], the overall β is β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)2^2+], the overall β is β1*β2 =9*40=360.

For [Co(SCN)3^3-], β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

And for [Co(SCN)4^4-], β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

With this approach, the overall β for each complex is:

β1=9

β2=9*40=360

β3=9*40*63=22680

β4=9*40*63*16=362880

So, each complex's concentration is [Co(SCN)_n] = (β_n) * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but in this approach, the [Co(SCN)_n] would be:

[CoSCN+] = β1 x [SCN^-] =9 * x * 0.1

[Co(SCN)2^2+] = β2 x [SCN^-]^2 =360 *x*(0.1)^2

[Co(SCN)3^3-] = β3 x [SCN^-]^3=22680*x*(0.1)^3

[Co(SCN)4^4-] = β4 x [SCN^-]^4=362880 *x * (0.1)^4

So the total [Co] is x + β1 x [SCN] + β2 x [SCN]^2 + β3 x [SCN]^3 + β4 x [SCN]^4 =1e-2.

Plugging in the numbers:

x + (9 x 0.1) x + (360 x 0.01)x + (22680 x 0.001)x + (362880 x 0.0001)x =1e-2

Let me compute each term:

Term 0: x

Term1:9 *0.1 *x =0.9x

Term2:360 *0.01 *x=3.6x

Term3:22680 *0.001 *x=22.68x

Term4:362880 *0.0001 *x=36.288x

Sum all terms:

x (1) + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) x

Let's calculate the coefficients:

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So,

64.468 x =1e-2 → x = (1e-2)/64.468 ≈1.55e-4 M.

So [Co^2+] = x ≈1.55e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN+] = β1 x [SCN] =9 * 1.55e-4 *0.1= 1.395e-5 M.

[Co(SCN)2^2+] =β2 x [SCN]^2=360 * 1.55e-4 * (0.1)^2 → 360 *1.55e-4 *0.01 →360 * 1.55e-6 →5.58e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute that again:

360 *1.55e-4 = 360 * 0.000155 = 0.0558.

Multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01: 0.0558 *0.01=0.000558 →5.58e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3^3-] =β3 x [SCN]^3 =22680 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^3 →22680 *1.55e-4 = 22680 * 0.000155 ≈3.5142 → multiplied by (0.1)^3=0.001 → 3.5142 *0.001=0.0035142 →3.5142e-3 M.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute 22680 *1.55e-4:

22680 * 1.55e-4 =22680 * 0.000155.

22680 * 0.0001=2.268

22680 *0.00005=1.134

So sum is 2.268 +1.134=3.402 → approximately 3.402.

Then multiply by (0.1)^3=0.001: 3.402 *0.001=0.003402 →3.402e-3 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)4^4-] = β4 x [SCN]^4 =362880 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 362880 *1.55e-4: 362880 *0.000155.

Let me compute 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

362880 *0.00005=18.144.

So sum is 36.288 +18.144=54.432.

Multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001:54.432 *0.0001=0.0054432 →5.4432e-3 M.

Wait, no, wait. Because [SCN^-]^4 is (0.1)^4=0.0001, and β4 is 362880. So:

362880 *1.55e-4 * 0.0001 → Let me compute each step:

362880 *1.55e-4 =362880 *0.000155 = let's compute:

362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

362880 *0.00005=18.144.

So 36.288 +18.144=54.432.

Multiply by 0.0001:54.432 *0.0001=0.0054432.

So [Co(SCN)4^4-]=0.0054432 M.

Wait, but let's check the sum of all the concentrations:

[Co^2+] =1.55e-4 =0.000155

[CoSCN+] =1.395e-5=0.00001395

[Co(SCN)2^2+]=5.58e-4=0.000558

[Co(SCN)3^3-]=3.402e-3=0.003402

[Co(SCN)4^4-]=5.4432e-3=0.0054432

Adding all:

0.000155 +0.00001395=0.00016895

+0.000558 →0.00072695

+0.003402 →0.00412895

+0.0054432 →0.00957215

Wait, 0.00957215 is about 9.57e-3, which is less than 1e-2 (0.01). Hmm, so something's not adding up correctly.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try recalculate the sum again.

Wait, the sum of all the terms is:

x + (β1 * [SCN] )x + (β2 * [SCN]^2 )x + (β3 * [SCN]^3 )x + (β4 * [SCN]^4 )x =1e-2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each βn is stepwise, the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs.

So, the correct expressions for each complex are:

[CoSCN+] = β1 * [Co^2+] [ SCN^- ]

[Co(SCN)2^2+] = β2 * [CoSCN+] [ SCN^- ] = β1 β2 [Co^2+] [ SCN^- ]^2

[Co(SCN)3^3-] = β3 * [Co(SCN)2^2+] [ SCN^- ]= β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+] [ SCN^- ]^3

[Co(SCN)4^4-] = β4 * [Co(SCN)3^3-] [ SCN^- ]= β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+] [ SCN^- ]^4

So, the total [Co] is:

[Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN] + β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+][SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+][SCN]^4 =1e-2.

Factor out [Co^2+]:

[Co^2+][1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ] =1e-2.

Let me compute each term inside the brackets:

Compute each term:

Term 0:1

Term1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

Term2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 =9*40*63*(0.1)^3 = (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) →22680 *0.001=22.68

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 =9*40*63 *16*(0.1)^4 → (9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880) →362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are:

1, 0.9, 3.6, 22.68, 36.288.

Summing them:

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So [Co^2+ ] *64.468 =1e-2 → [Co^2+] = (1e-2)/64.468 ≈1.55e-4 M.

So that's correct. Now, the concentrations:

[CoSCN+] = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN] =9 *1.55e-4 *0.1=1.395e-5 M.

[Co(SCN)2^2+] = β1 β2 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2= (9*40)*1.55e-4*(0.1)^2 →360 *1.55e-4 *0.01 →360 *1.55e-6=5.58e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3^3-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+] [SCN]^3 → (9*40*63)=22680 →22680 *1.55e-4 *0.001 →22680 *1.55e-7 →approximately 3.514e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)4^4-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+] [SCN]^4 → (9*40*63*16)=362880 →362880 *1.55e-4 *0.0001 →362880 *1.55e-8 →5.618e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute each precisely.

[CoSCN+] =9 *1.55e-4 *0.1 =9 *0.000155 *0.1 →9 *0.0000155 =0.0001395 →1.395e-4 M.

Wait wait, earlier calculation said 1.395e-5 but now it's 1.395e-4. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, perhaps a miscalculation.

Wait, 9 *1.55e-4 =0.0001395. Multiply by 0.1: 0.0001395 *0.1=0.00001395 →1.395e-5 M. So earlier was correct.

[Co(SCN)2^2+] = (9*40) *1.55e-4 *(0.1)^2 →360 *1.55e-4 *0.01 →360 *1.55e-6 →5.58e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3^3-] =9*40*63 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^3 →22680 *1.55e-4 *0.001 →22680 *1.55e-7 → (22680 *1.55)=35142 →35142e-7 =3.5142e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)4^4-] =9*40*63*16 *1.55e-4 * (0.1)^4 →362880 *1.55e-4 *0.0001 →362880 *1.55e-8 → 362880 * 1.55 =561,  let's compute 362880 *1.55:

362880 *1 =362880

362880 *0.5=181440

362880 *0.05=18144

Sum: 362880 +181440=544320 +18144=562,464 →562464.

Multiply by 1e-8:562464e-8=5.62464e-3 M.

So the concentrations are:

[Co^2+] =1.55e-4 M.

[CoSCN+] = 1.395e-5 M.

[Co(SCN)2^2+] =5.58e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3^3-] =3.5142e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)4^4-] =5.62464e-3 M.

Now, let's sum all of them:

1.55e-4 →0.000155

1.395e-5 →0.00001395

5.58e-4 →0.000558

3.5142e-3 →0.0035142

5.62464e-3 →0.00562464

Adding:

0.000155 +0.00001395=0.00016895

+0.000558 →0.00072695

+0.0035142 →0.00424115

+0.00562464 →0.00986579 ≈0.009866 M.

But the total [Co] should be 1e-2=0.01 M. Hmm, so missing about 0.000134, which is about 0.134 mM. Maybe because of rounding errors, but it's close enough. So perhaps the calculations are correct.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. The blue one is [Co(SCN)2]^2+, which we've calculated as 5.58e-4 M.

So, to find the percentage, we take the concentration of [Co(SCN)2^2+] divided by the total cobalt concentration (1e-2 M) multiplied by 100.

So, (5.58e-4 / 1e-2) *100 = (5.58e-4 / 0.01 )*100 → (0.00558) *100 →0.558%.

Wait, that can't be right. 0.558% seems too low, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which is way higher. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations. Because 5.58e-4 is 0.000558 M. The total [Co] is 0.01 M. So 0.000558 /0.01 =0.0558 →5.58%.

Hmm, that's 5.58%, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about which complex is blue.

Wait, the question says the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- per Co, which is [Co(SCN)2]^2+. But perhaps the blue color is a different complex. Alternatively, maybe the βn are given as the overall constants, not the stepwise.

Wait, maybe the initial approach (where βn are the overall constants) was correct, and the second approach (stepwise) is wrong. Because in that case, the [Co(SCN)2^2+] was 1.689e-3 M, which is 1.689e-3 / 0.01 = 16.89%, which is close to option D:16.9%.

Ah, so perhaps the correct approach is to take the βn as the overall constants, not the stepwise.

Let me go back to that.

Earlier, when I assumed βn are the overall constants, I got:

x= [Co^2+] =4.223e-3 M.

[CoSCN+] =9 *4.223e-3 *0.1= 0.000379 M.

[Co(SCN)2^2+] =40 *4.223e-3 *0.01= 1.689e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)3^3-]=63 *4.223e-3 *0.001=2.661e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)4^4-]=16 *4.223e-3 *0.0001=6.757e-6 M.

Sum these:

4.223e-3 +0.000379=4.2609e-3

+1.689e-3 →5.9499e-3

+2.661e-4 →6.216e-3

+6.757e-6 →6.2227e-3.

Wait, that's only about 6.22e-3 M, which is 0.00622 M, which is way less than the required 0.01 M.

So that can't be right. Hence, the initial approach must be wrong. Which means that βn must be the stepwise constants, and perhaps I made a miscalculation in the fractions.

Wait, but when I calculated the [Co(SCN)2^2+] as 5.58e-4 M, which is 0.000558 M, the fraction is 5.58e-4 /0.01=5.58%? That's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the βn assignments. Maybe the βn given are for the complexes where n is different. For example, perhaps β1 is for [Co(SCN)4]^4-?

No, that can't be. Because the β values are increasing from 9 to 40 to 63, and then drop to 16. So the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)3]^3- with β3=63.

Wait, but in the stepwise approach, [Co(SCN)2^2+] is 5.58e-4 M, which is 5.58 mM. But 5.58 mM is 0.00558 M, which is 5.58% of 0.01 M. Hmm, so 5.58% isn't one of the options. The options are 16.9% (D), 25.6% (B), etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the stepwise approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider all possible complexes and their contributions. Let me try another approach.

Another approach is to compute the fraction of each complex using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (β_0 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but this only works if βn is the overall constant for each step. Alternatively, perhaps the fraction is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / sum_{m=0 to 4} (β_m [SCN]^m )

where β0 =1 (for [Co^2+]).

So, β0=1, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, no, that can't be right because when n=0, it's [Co^2+], which would have β0=1.

So the sum is:

sum = 1*(0.1)^0 +9*(0.1)^1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1*(1) =1

9*(0.1)=0.9

40*(0.01)=0.4

63*(0.001)=0.063

16*(0.0001)=0.0016

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So sum =2.3646.

Now, the fraction for [Co(SCN)2^2+] is (β2 [SCN]^2) / sum → (40 * 0.01 ) /2.3646 →0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169, or 16.9%.

Which matches option D.

Ah, so that's the correct approach. So the fraction of [Co(SCN)2^2+] is 16.9%.

So the answer is D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Complex**: The fraction of each cobalt species is determined using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^{4} \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}
   \]
   Here, β₀ = 1 (for free Co²⁺), and β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄ are given.

2. **Numerator for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**: For the dithiocyanato complex, the numerator is:
   \[
   \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4
   \]

3. **Denominator (Total Sum)**: The denominator is the sum of contributions from all cobalt species:
   \[
   \sum_{m=0}^{4} \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m = \beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \sum = 1 \times (0.1)^0 + 9 \times (0.1)^1 + 40 \times (0.1)^2 + 63 \times (0.1)^3 + 16 \times (0.1)^4
   \]
   \[
   \sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**: The fraction is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\sum} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

5. **Percentage**: Convert the fraction to a percentage:
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
