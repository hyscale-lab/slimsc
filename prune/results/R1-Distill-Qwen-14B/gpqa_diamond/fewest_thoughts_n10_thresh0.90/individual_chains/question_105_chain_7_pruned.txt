Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the question says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the brightness variations caused by the spots modulating (like a light curve) can mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking, what's the radius ratio (Rpl/Rstar) of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as these spots?

Hmm, so the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by an exoplanet. Normally, when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. Here, the spots are causing a similar effect but in a different way.

First, I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the planet blocks a circular area of the star, the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk divided by the star's area. Since area goes with the square of radius, this is why it's squared.

But in this case, the spots are causing a dip in brightness too. The spots are dark, so they emit less light. When they come into view, the total brightness decreases. The question says that the spots have a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots, right?

So each spot is cooler, but how does that affect the brightness? Because the spots are cooler, each part of them emits less flux than the surrounding area. So when the spot is facing us, the star's total flux decreases because that part is emitting less.

Let me think about this. The star's total flux is the sum of all the flux from its surface. When a spot is present, the flux from that area is less. So the total flux change (ΔF) can be calculated as the difference between the unhindered flux and the spotted flux.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Wait, wait, that's 6000 K for the star, and the spots are 5000 K? Or is it a difference of 1000 K, so 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K for the spots? I think that's correct.

The flux from a blackbody is proportional to T^4. So for a given area, the star's flux is σTeff^4, and the spots' flux is σ(Teff - ΔT)^4. Wait, no, the star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. So the flux from a spot is (5000/6000)^4 times the star's flux.

The filling factor is 0.20 for each hemisphere. But wait, the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. The maximum dip in brightness would occur when the maximum number of spots is visible.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots on the hemisphere will be facing us. The filling factor of 20% for one hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.20 * (4π R_star^2 / 2) ), because a hemisphere is half the surface area. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the star's entire surface.

Wait, the star's entire surface area is 4π R_star². Each hemisphere is 2π R_star². So filling factor is 0.20 per hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.20 * 2π R_star² = 0.4 π R_star².

But when the star isn't rotating, we only see half the star. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are in view. So the total flux without any spots would be from the entire star. With the spots, the flux is the flux from the unspotted parts plus the spots.

Wait, no. The star's total flux when the spotted side is facing us is the flux from the unspotted area plus the flux from the spotted area.

So let's compute the flux change when the spots are in view.

The star's total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

Flux_total = Flux_unspotted + Flux_spots.

Flux_unspotted = (1 - 0.20) * (Flux per unit area of star) * Area of
