Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Hmm, that's 6.59e-7 eV. Approximately 7e-7 eV. 

Now for the second state, Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 
Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV.

So ΔE2 is about 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the actual energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two levels might overlap when considering their energy ranges. So the minimum energy difference should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Calculating that sum: 6.59e-7 eV + 6.59e-8 eV = approximately 7.25e-7 eV. So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than about 7e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 7e-7, so no.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is much larger than 7e-7. So that's way bigger. So it's a possible candidate.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6, which is less than 7e-7 eV. So no.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the numbers. So 7e-7 eV is 0.7e-6 eV. Option C is 1e-4, which is 100e-6, so that's about 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 7e-7. So that would easily distinguish the two states.

But wait, is there a rule about how much bigger the energy difference needs to be than the uncertainty? Like, perhaps it's not just a sum but maybe a factor of 2 or something. But I think in the context of this question, the energy difference just needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. So any energy difference above that sum would be sufficient.

So, the correct energy difference should be at least about 7e-7 eV. Looking at the options, only option C is larger than that. So the answer must be option C) 10^-4 eV.


To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties. The energy uncertainty for each state is determined by the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. Converting the result to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

1. For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The total uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — Too small, as \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} < 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — Too small, as \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} < 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — Sufficiently large, as \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} > 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — Too small, as \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} < 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.

Answer: C
