Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Hmm, that's 6.59e-7 eV. Approximately 7e-7 eV. 

Now for the second state, Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 
Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV.

So ΔE2 is about 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the actual energy difference is much larger than the uncertainties, it's easy to distinguish. If it's smaller, the uncertainty might make it hard to tell.

The sum of the uncertainties would be ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 6.59e-7 + 6.59e-8 = about 7.25e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 (assuming E2 is higher than E1) should be greater than 7.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:
Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way bigger than 7.25e-7 eV. So that's a possible answer.

Option A is 1e-9 eV. That's 0.000000001 eV. Which is smaller than 7.25e-7 eV. So that's too small; the energy difference would be lost in the uncertainty.

Option B is 1e-11 eV. Even smaller, so not enough.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. Which is 0.00000001 eV. Also smaller than 7.25e-7, so not enough.

So the only option that's bigger is option C, 1e-4 eV. Hence, the correct answer should be C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. The energy uncertainty \( \Delta E \) for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
- For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for clear resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is also smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is **Option C**.
