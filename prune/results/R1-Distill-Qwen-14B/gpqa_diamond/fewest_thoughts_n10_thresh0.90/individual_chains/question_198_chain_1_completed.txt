Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants are involved in determining the predominant species in a solution. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to Co(SCN)_2^2+ or maybe a higher complex. Wait, blue is the color of the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, I think. Or maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^ something? I might need to recall the common cobalt thiocyanate complexes and their colors. But for now, let's focus on the calculations.

Stability constants (β) typically represent the formation of complexes stepwise. So each β is for adding one SCN- to the previous complex. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, and so on. Wait, no. Stability constants are usually for the overall formation. Oh wait, no, I think each β is the stepwise formation constant. So each β represents adding one SCN- ion to the current complex. So the overall formation constant for CoX^n+ would be the product of the β's up to X.

Wait, maybe it's better to write out the possible complexes. Cobalt can form several thiocyanato complexes. Let's list them.

Co^2+ can form:

1. Co(SCN)_1^+ : this would be the first complex, with β1=9.
2. Co(SCN)_2: with β2=40, so the overall β up to this point would be β1 * β2.
Wait, no. Wait, the stepwise formation constants. So β1 is K1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) ), and β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-]) ). So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_2 would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360.

Similarly, β3 would be for the third SCN- addition. So the third complex is Co(SCN)_3^-. Wait, because each SCN comes with a charge of -1. Co^2+ + n SCN^- would give Co(SCN)_n^(2-n). So for n=1, 2+ +1*(-1) =1+ charge. For n=2, 2+ +2*(-1)=0, so neutral. For n=3, 2+ +3*(-1)= -1. And for n=4, 2+ +4*(-1)= -2. So the complexes would have charges +1, 0, -1, -2, right?

Wait the problem mentions dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN groups. So Co(SCN)_2^0. So the question is asking for the percentage of Co(SCN)_2 among all the Co complexes.

Wait, but the options are given, so maybe I need to calculate the fractions of each possible complex and sum the one for Co(SCN)_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the blue color as the predominant species, which I think is [Co(SCN)_4]^2- or another. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the color. Let me think: I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. So that would be the fourth complex. Wait, but the problem says "blue dithiocyanato", which would be two SCN. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, perhaps the blue is the [Co(SCN)_3]^ something. Maybe I should just proceed with the calculations and see.

But regardless, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is probably the [Co(SCN)_2] complex.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the stability constants given are β1, β2, β3, β4. So four different complexes, Co(SCN)_1^+, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3^-, and Co(SCN)_4^2-.

So the four β's are stepwise formation constants. So each β corresponds to adding one more SCN-.

So the first complex is Co(SCN)^+ with β1=9.

The second is Co(SCN)_2, with β2=40. So the formation constant for this is β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360.

The third is Co(SCN)_3^- with β3=63. So formation constant for this would be β1 * β2 * β3 = 9*40*63=22680.

The fourth is Co(SCN)_4^2- with β4=16. So its formation constant would be 9*40*63*16= 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN groups, so Co(SCN)_2. So I need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)_2 in the solution.

But wait, how do the stability constants affect the distribution of the complexes?

The problem is about the distribution of Co between different complexes. The Co exists in all possible forms: Co^2+, Co(SCN), Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3^-, Co(SCN)_4^2-.

We can model the distribution using the stability constants and the concentrations of the reagents.

The general approach is to express each species' concentration in terms of the others, and then use the total concentration to find the fractions.

But since the problem involves multiple complexes, perhaps it's easier to use the method of successive approximations or set up an equilibrium expression.

But wait, another approach is to use the concept of the formation constants and calculate the relative concentrations of each species.

Let me think: The total concentration of all Co species is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

The formation constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4.

The key is to find the ratio of each species. The distribution of Co between the complexes depends on the product of the formation constants and the [SCN^-] raised to the appropriate power.

The fraction f_n of the nth complex is proportional to β1β2...βn * [SCN]^n / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN]^4 )

Wait, actually, the fraction f_n is given by (β1β2...β_n [SCN]^n) divided by the sum over all m of (β1β2...β_m [SCN]^m).

So in this case, the denominator is S = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-].

Each term in S is [Co^n SCm] = β1β2...β_n [SCN]^n.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is the free ion, which can be considered as the first term, n=0.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to model each species' concentration:

[Co^2+] = c_total * α_0,

[Co(SCN)]^+ = c_total * α_1 [SCN]^1,

[Co(SCN)_2] = c_total * α_2 [SCN]^2,

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = c_total * α_3 [SCN]^3,

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = c_total * α_4 [SCN]^4.

Where α_n is the fraction of Co in the nth complex.

Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The fraction α_n is [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}]/c_total.

So, the concentration of each complex is c_total * α_n.

But each α_n is equal to (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4[SCN]^4 )

Because the denominator comes from the sum of all the possible complexes, including the free ion (n=0).

So, let me denote K1= β1, K2= β1β2, K3= β1β2β3, K4= β1β2β3β4.

Then, the denominator S is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4.

Each term in S is the product for each complex.

So the fraction for each complex is (K_n [SCN]^n) / S.

So, for the case where n=2, K2 = β1β2 = 9 *40=360.

n=2, so [SCN]^2 = (0.1)^2=0.01.

So the numerator for n=2 is 360 *0.01=3.6.

Similarly, compute each term in the denominator:

Term 0 (n=0): 1.

Term 1 (n=1): β1 [SCN] = 9 *0.1=0.9.

Term 2 (n=2): 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3 (n=3): K3 [SCN]^3 = (9 *40 *63) * (0.1)^3.

Compute K3: 9 *40=360; 360 *63=22680.

Then 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4 (n=4): K4 [SCN]^4 = (9*40*63*16) * (0.1)^4.

Compute K4: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16= 362880.

Then 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So each term in S is:

1 (term0) + 0.9 (term1) + 3.6 (term2) +22.68 (term3) +36.288 (term4) = Let's sum these up.

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the denominator S=64.468.

Then, the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05559, which is about 5.56%.

Wait, that's the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]. But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which is n=4, then we'd have to calculate for n=4.

Wait, but the question says "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN groups. So that's for n=2. So the fraction for n=2 is about 5.56%.

But wait, the options given don't have this. The closest is option D:16.9%, but that's higher. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait. Another possibility is that the stability constant β4 is for the fourth complex. Wait, but in our calculation, the denominator is the sum of all possible complexes, including the free Co^2+.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I thought was Co(SCN)_2. But perhaps the blue is another complex. Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the blue is the most stable complex, which would be the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex.

In that case, we'd calculate the fraction for n=4.

Let me recompute for n=4.

Term4 is 36.288 as computed earlier. So fraction is 36.288 /64.468 ≈ 0.5628, which is 56.28%. But that's not one of the options either.

Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the fractions are calculated.

Wait, perhaps the approach I'm taking is wrong. Another approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step.

Let me think, the general approach is to consider the log of the fraction of each species, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the conditional formation constant and then find the species distribution.

Wait, let's think about the formation of each complex step by step. The total concentration of Co is 0.01 M, and [SCN] is 0.1 M.

Each complex formation can be considered as a series of reactions:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^+ , β1=9.

Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2, β2=40.

Co(SCN)_2 + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^-, β3=63.

Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^2-, β4=16.

So, the overall formation constants are:

For Co(SCN)_2: β1 * β2 = 9*40=360.

For Co(SCN)_3^-: 360 *63=22680.

For Co(SCN)_4^2-: 22680 *16=362880.

Now, the distribution of Co between the complexes can be calculated using the stability constants and the [SCN^-] concentration.

The fractions of each species can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2...β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is what I did earlier.

So plugging in the numbers again:

Compute each term:

Term 0 (n=0): 1.

Term 1 (n=1): β1 [SCN] = 9 *0.1=0.9.

Term 2 (n=2): 9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3 (n=3): 9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4 (n=4): 9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So summing all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6 =5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

Then:

f0 =1/64.468 ≈0.01551 → 1.551%.

f1=0.9/64.468≈0.01396→1.396%.

f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05559 →5.559%.

f3=22.68/64.468≈0.3518→35.18%.

f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5628→56.28%.

Wait, the sum of these should be 100%? Let's check: 1.55 +1.4 +5.56 +35.18 +56.28 ≈100%, yes.

So the fractions are: about 1.55% free Co^2+, 1.4% for Co(SCN)^+, 5.56% for Co(SCN)_2, 35.18% for Co(SCN)_3^-, and 56.28% for Co(SCN)_4^2-.

So the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which is 56.28% as per the calculation.

But the options don't have 56% as an option. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in assuming which complex is blue?

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^ something. Or maybe I have the fractions wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato (two SCN) complexes, which includes both Co(SCN)_2 and Co(SCN)_4^2- if they have two SCN. Wait, no, because Co(SCN)_4^2- has four SCN.

Wait wait, no. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN. So the correct species is Co(SCN)_2, which is 5.56% according to the calculation. But none of the options are near 5.5%.

So where is the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps the [SCN] is 0.1 M, so the calculations are correct. Let me recheck the math.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator:

Term0:1.

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2:9*40*(0.1)^2 →9*40=360, 0.1^2=0.01 →360*0.01=3.6.

Term3:9*40*63*(0.1)^3 →9*40=360; 360 *63=22680; (0.1)^3=0.001 →22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 →9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; (0.1)^4=0.0001 →362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum:1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Yes, correct. So the fractions are as I calculated.

Wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato, which would be Co(SCN)_2. That's 5.56% but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Wait, maybe the β's are overall constants, not stepwise. Oh wait, that's another possibility. I need to clarify whether the stability constants are stepwise or overall.

If the β's are overall constants, then each β corresponds to the formation of Co(SCN)_n from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

So for Co(SCN)_1^+ , β1=9.

For Co(SCN)_2, β2=40. Wait, but that would mean the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_2 is 40, not 9*40=360.

So if that's the case, the approach is different.

In that case, the formation constants for each complex are:

β1= [Co(SCN)] / ([Co][SCN]) →9.

β2= [Co(SCN)_2] / ([Co][SCN]^2) →40.

β3= [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co][SCN]^3) →63.

β4= [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/([Co][SCN]^4) →16.

In this case, the overall formation constants are as given, and each βn = K_n = [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co][SCN]^n).

In this scenario, the fractions are calculated differently.

The total concentration is c = [Co] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-}.

Each [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co][SCN]^n.

So the concentration of [Co] is c * α, where α is the fraction of free Co.

So:

[Co] = c * α.

[Co(SCN)] = β1 * c * α [SCN].

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * c * α [SCN]^2.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * c * α [SCN]^3.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β4 * c * α [SCN]^4.

The sum of all these terms is c:

c = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-}.

Which becomes:

c = c α (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ).

So alpha is 1/(1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + beta3 [SCN]^3 + beta4 [SCN]^4).

Then, the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) * alpha.

So let's compute this.

Given [SCN]=0.1 M.

Compute the denominator D:

D =1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Plug in the numbers:

β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So D=1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = let's add them:

1+0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Then alpha =1/D ≈0.4225.

Now, the fraction for each species:

f0 = alpha *1=0.4225 →42.25%.

f1= beta1 [SCN] * alpha =0.9 *0.4225≈0.38025 →38.025%.

f2= beta2 [SCN]^2 * alpha=0.4 *0.4225≈0.169 →16.9%.

f3= beta3 [SCN]^3 * alpha=0.063 *0.4225≈0.0266 →2.66%.

f4= beta4 [SCN]^4 * alpha=0.0016 *0.4225≈0.000676 →0.0676%.

Now sum these fractions: 42.25 +38.025=80.275; +16.9=97.175; +2.66=99.835; +0.0676=99.8996. Close enough to 100%, considering rounding.

So, the fractions are:

Co^2+:42.25%.

Co(SCN)^+:38.025%.

Co(SCN)_2:16.9%.

Co(SCN)_3^-:2.66%.

Co(SCN)_4^2-:0.0676%.

So the question is asking for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which is 0.0676%, that's not the case. But the question says dithiocyanato, which implies two SCN groups. So that's [Co(SCN)_2], which is 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but the options are:

A)42.3% (close to f0).

B)25.6% (maybe a miscalculation? No, f1 is 38.)

C)38.1% (f1 is ~38%).

D)16.9% (f2 is ~16.9%).

So the correct answer is D.

But wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So according to this, the βn are the overall constants, not the stepwise. Therefore, the approach of using each β as the overall K for the nth complex is correct, leading to the percentage of Co(SCN)_2 being 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the initial approach assumed the βn were stepwise and we got a different answer. So it's crucial to know whether the β's are stepwise or overall. The problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40..." which typically implies that β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc., possibly stepwise. But sometimes, the stability constant is given as the overall constant for the complex with that many ligands.

This is a critical point. In the first approach (stepwise), the fraction of Co(SCN)_2 was 5.56%, but that's not an option. In the second approach (overall), the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

Since the options include 16.9%, and that's what we get with the overall β's, that must be the correct approach.

So the answer is D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and the concentration of thiocyanate ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The stability constants provided are interpreted as overall formation constants for the respective complexes, not stepwise constants. The complexes considered are:

1. **Co²⁺** (free ion),
2. **Co(SCN)⁺**,
3. **Co(SCN)₂**,
4. **Co(SCN)₃⁻**,
5. **Co(SCN)₄²⁻**.

The fraction of each species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
\]

where \( \beta_n \) is the stability constant for the nth complex, and \( [\text{SCN}] \) is the concentration of thiocyanate.

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is the sum of all terms representing the total concentration of cobalt species:

\[
D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
\]

Substituting the given values (\( \beta_1 = 9, \beta_2 = 40, \beta_3 = 63, \beta_4 = 16 \)) and \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \):

- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \),
- \( \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 9 \times 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \),
- \( \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 9 \times 40 \times 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \),
- \( \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 9 \times 40 \times 63 \times 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \).

\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fractions of each species
The fraction of each species is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{D}
\]

- For **Co²⁺** (\( n = 0 \)):
  \[
  f_0 = \frac{1}{D} = \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.4225 \, (42.25\%)
  \]

- For **Co(SCN)⁺** (\( n = 1 \)):
  \[
  f_1 = \frac{\beta_1 [\text{SCN}]}{D} = \frac{0.9}{2.3646} \approx 0.3803 \, (38.03\%)
  \]

- For **Co(SCN)₂** (\( n = 2 \)):
  \[
  f_2 = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1690 \, (16.90\%)
  \]

- For **Co(SCN)₃⁻** (\( n = 3 \)):
  \[
  f_3 = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3}{D} = \frac{0.063}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \, (2.66\%)
  \]

- For **Co(SCN)₄²⁻** (\( n = 4 \)):
  \[
  f_4 = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}{D} = \frac{0.0016}{2.3646} \approx 0.000676 \, (0.0676\%)
  \]

### Step 3: Identify the blue dithiocyanato complex
The blue dithiocyanato complex corresponds to **Co(SCN)₂**, which has two thiocyanate ligands. From the calculations, the fraction of **Co(SCN)₂** is approximately \( 16.90\% \).
