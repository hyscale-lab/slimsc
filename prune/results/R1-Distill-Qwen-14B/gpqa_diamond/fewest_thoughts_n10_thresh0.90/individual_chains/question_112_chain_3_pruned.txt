Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's see.

First, the given state is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that for probability, the state needs to be normalized. So I should probably find the normalization factor first.

The normalization condition is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients. So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2−i). Let me calculate |1+i|^2 and |2−i|^2.

For |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.
For |2−i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.
So the total squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7), right? So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator's matrix representation is given by Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1 off-diagonal. So the operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

So the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of sigma_x. These states are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Wait, wait, actually, I think the eigenvalues correspond to +1 and -1 for sigma_x, so when multiplied by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But wait, the question says the operator is represented by Aij. So this operator is sigma_x scaled by hbar/2. Therefore, when we express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, the coefficients would give the probabilities for each eigenstate.

So first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Let me denote the eigenstates as |+x> and |-x>, and find the expansion coefficients.

Let me write down |+x> and |-x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, the given state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7)|down>

I need to rewrite this in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me represent |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. Let me denote:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

So, substituting |+x> and |-x>:

= c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping the terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But we also have |alpha> expressed as:

= (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>

So equating the coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i) / sqrt(7)
( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7)

Let me write these two equations:

Equation 1: (c_+ + c_-) = (1 + i) sqrt(2/7)
Equation 2: (c_+ - c_-) = (2 - i) sqrt(2/7)

Now, I can solve these two equations for c_+ and c_-.

Adding equation 1 and 2:

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] sqrt(2/7)
= (3) sqrt(2/7)
So c_+ = (3/2) sqrt(2/7) = (3)/(2) * sqrt(2/7)

Wait, let me compute that:

sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(2)/sqrt(7). So,

c_+ = (3/(2)) * (sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)) ) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] sqrt(2/7)
= [ (1-2) + (i + i) ] sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2/7)

So c_- = [ (-1 +2i) / 2 ] sqrt(2/7)

Wait, let's compute both c_+ and c_-.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to compute c_+ and c_- in terms of |alpha> components.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x> because the coefficients c_+ and c_- are just the inner products < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the inner product with |alpha> is:

< +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( < up | + < down | ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ]

Simplify inside the brackets: 1 + 2 =3, i -i=0. So 3.

So, < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14)) )

Similarly, the coefficient c_+ is 3/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) is sqrt(14). So yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the other coefficient c_- is the inner product of |alpha> with |-x>.

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | - < down | ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(14)) ) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ]

Simplify the numerator: 1-2 = -1, i +i= 2i. So (-1 + 2i).

So, < -x | alpha > = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

Now, the probabilities are the square of the absolute values of these coefficients.

So, |c_+|^2 is (3^2)/(14) =9/14.

|c_-|^2 is | (-1 +2i ) |^2 /14.

Compute | -1 +2i |^2: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1+4=5. So 5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9+5=14, so that adds up to 1. Makes sense.

Wait, but in the options, the probabilities are expressed as 0.61, 0.29 etc. Let me compute 9/14 and 5/14 in decimal.

9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is ~0.64. And 5/14 is about 0.357, which is ~0.36. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure.

Wait |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Then we normalized it by sqrt(7) because |1+i|^2=2 and |2−i|^2=5, so 2+5=7. So |alpha> is correct.

Then, when computing < +x | alpha >, I found 3/sqrt(14), which squared is 9/14 ≈0.6428 (0.64).

Similarly, < -x | alpha > squared is 5/14 ≈0.357 (0.36). So the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, but what about the average value.

The average value of operator A is < alpha | A | alpha >.

Alternatively, since A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x> with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

So the expectation value is |c_+|^2 * (hbar/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-hbar/2).

So, (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = (9-5)/(14*2) hbar = 4/(28) hbar = 1/7 hbar.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, but option A has the average as hbar/7. So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.64, 5/14≈0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So that would correspond to option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the average calculation.

Another approach: compute < alpha | A | alpha >.

Since A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, then A = (hbar/2) [[0,1],[1,0]].

The state |alpha> is a spin-1/2 state, so a 2-component vector.

Let me represent |alpha> in the z-basis as a vector:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, the density matrix is |alpha><alpha|.

The expectation value of A is Tr(A rho), where rho is the density matrix of |alpha>.

Compute rho = |alpha><alpha|:

rho = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7)   (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]
        [ (1-i)/sqrt(7)   (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

But maybe it's easier to compute <A> by matrix multiplication.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So, compute <alpha | A |alpha>:

= ( (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ) * [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

First, multiply A with |alpha>:

A |alpha> = [ (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)*(1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, take the inner product with <alpha|:

= ( (1 - i)/sqrt(7) )*(hbar/2)*(2 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) )*(hbar/2)*(1 + i)/sqrt(7 )

Factor out (hbar/2) * (1/7):

= (hbar/(2*7)) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 = 2 -i -2i + (-1) = 2-3i -1 =1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) =2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i^2 =2 +2i +i + (-1) =2+3i -1 =1 +3i.

So, sum is (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So, <A> = (hbar/(14)) * 2 = hbar/7.

Which matches the previous result.

So the average is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36), and expectation hbar/7. So looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option D says 0.61 and 0.29, which don't match. So A is the right option?

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the inner products. Let me check.

Wait, what's the probability of measuring |+x> and |-x>?

Earlier, I found |c_+|^2 is 9/14 ≈0.6428, about 0.64, and |c_-|^2=5/14≈0.357, about 0.36.

So option A's probabilities are correct.

But option B has 0.54 and 0.46. That doesn't match. Option D's probabilities are 0.61 and 0.29, which are close but not exact.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recompute the inner product < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, < +x | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2)] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

= [1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ] [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

= [1/sqrt(14)] [3 + 0i ]

So c_+ is 3 / sqrt(14).

So |c_+|^2=9/14≈0.6428.

Same as before.

Wait, so that's correct.

So the correct probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, looking back at the options, I see:

Option A: 0.64,0.36 and hbar/7.

But wait, let me check question again. The operator's matrix is Aij= hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, is that correct? Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is hbar/2 * Pauli X. So its eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Yes, so the average is hbar/7, which appears in option A and option D.

Wait, but option D's average is 2hbar/sqrt(7) which is bigger.

So according to the calculations, option A has the correct probabilities and average.

But wait, looking at the options: option C has
