Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about uncertainty in the P_z operator. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation formula, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.

The problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, which should simplify things.

Wait, no. Actually, the state is expressed in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So, since each component of the state corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z, the expectation value of P_z should be straightforward. Because each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z, when you measure P_z in this state, you just get the eigenvalue multiplied by the square of the amplitude. Or wait, the expectation value is the sum of |c_i|^2 * p_i, where c_i are the components and p_i are the eigenvalues.

Wait, let me think again. The state is |ψ⟩ = a|p_z=ħ⟩ + b|p_z=0⟩ + c|p_z=-ħ⟩. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which has eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ? Wait, looking back, the matrix for P_z has first row (ħ,0,0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. The basis vectors are the standard basis vectors: |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩. So the state is expressed as a linear combination of these, where each corresponds to P_z eigenvalues.

Wait, the state is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). That means ψ = (-1/2)|1⟩ + (1/√2)|2⟩ + (-1/2)|3⟩.

So the expectation value of P_z is the sum of |c_i|^2 * eigenvalue for each component.

Let's compute that. The components are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

So |c1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, |c2|^2 = 1/2, |c3|^2 = 1/4.

Eigenvalues are: for |1⟩, it's ħ; |2⟩, it's 0; |3⟩, it's -ħ.

So expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0.

Hmm, so the expectation value is zero. That's interesting.

But wait, the uncertainty is the square root of ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩². Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, the uncertainty is just sqrt⟨P_z²⟩.

So I need to compute ⟨P_z^2⟩. But wait, P_z is an operator, so P_z squared is just the square of the operator, but since P_z is diagonal in this basis, because it's already in the eigenbasis. So the matrix representation of P_z² is the same as the diagonal matrix with each eigenvalue squared.

Wait, because for each basis vector |i⟩, P_z^2 |i⟩ = (p_i)^2 |i⟩. So the matrix elements of P_z squared are (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 on the diagonal, which is ħ², 0, ħ².

So to compute ⟨ψ | P_z² | ψ ⟩:

Each term is |c_i|^2 times (eigenvalue)^2.

So again, |c1|^2 * (ħ)^2 + |c2|^2 * 0 + |c3|^2 * (ħ)^2.

So that's (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Then the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

So looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as a column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Thus, the state $\psi$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenstates:

\[
\psi = -\frac{1}{2} \lvert \hbar \rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \lvert 0 \rangle - \frac{1}{2} \lvert -\hbar \rangle.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $\psi$) and $\lambda_i$ are the corresponding eigenvalues of $P_z$. The components of $\psi$ are:

\[
c_1 = -\frac{1}{2}, \quad c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad c_3 = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 (\lambda_i)^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.
