Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that these are both high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, like detecting exoplanets or measuring stellar velocities.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different characteristics. The key is to determine which stars are bright enough to be observed by both instruments, considering their magnitude limits.

Let me read the problem again. It says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, brighter than 17 mag? Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17 mag. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So HIRES can go down to 16 mag, which is brighter than ESPRESSO's 17. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16, because that's the stricter condition (since 16 is brighter than 17). Wait, no: wait, if a star is brighter (lower magnitude), both can see it. If a star is fainter than 16, then HIRES can't see it. If it's fainter than 17, ESPRESSO can't. So the stars must have apparent V magnitudes â‰¤ 16, because both can handle that.

Wait no, wait. The problem says: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Hmm, so if a star is brighter than 17 (i.e., magnitude <17), ESPRESSO can see it. For HIRES, brighter than 16 mag, so magnitude <16. So for a star to be seen by both, it must have apparent V mag <16 (so that it's brighter than 16, which is the higher limit for HIRES) and less than 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, but wait: if
