Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit for the stars it can observe. I think the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitudes, while HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. So the goal is to find stars that are bright enough for both instruments.

Wait, but wait. Oh right, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So a star must be observable by both, meaning it's brighter than both of their limits? Or do I have it backwards? Let me think. If a star is brighter (lower magnitude number), it's easier to detect. So for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than the brighter of the two thresholds. Because, for example, if a star is magnitude 16, ESPRESSO can't see it because it only goes up to 17. Wait, no—ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, which is fainter. So a star that's magnitude 16 is brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it, and since HIRES can handle up to 16, that star would be too bright for HIRES? Wait no—no, the magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V magnitude 16 is fainter than 15. So if the limit for HIRES is brighter than 16, meaning they can only observe stars with V mag less than or equal to 16. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 V mag" for HIRES. Wait, no. Wait, the way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, if a star's V mag is less than 17, it's brighter, so detectable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, mag brighter than 16, so less than 16.

Wait, but wait: apparent magnitude is what determines how bright it appears to us. So for a star to be detected, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. So the limiting apparent magnitude is the maximum the instrument can handle. So a star with apparent V mag of 16.5 is fainter than 17, so detectable by ESPRESSO, but HIRES can't handle it because its limit is 16. So it needs to be less than 16 to be detected by HIRES.

But wait, let me recheck: The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So the apparent V mag must be less than 17. Because if a star is brighter than 17, it's within the detectable range. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag <16.

So, to be detected by both, the star's apparent V mag must be less than 16.

Wait, but some stars have absolute magnitudes given, not apparent. So I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. So apparent magnitude is absolute magnitude plus distance modulus. Distance modulus is 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So d=10, so modulus is 5*(log10(1)) = 0. So apparent mag is 15.5 + 0 =15.5. So 15.5 is less than 16, so detectable by both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent mag is 16.5. So for ESPRESSO, can detect it because 16.5 <17. But for HIRES, needs to be <16. 16.5>16, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So we need to calculate the extinction (the absorption), which affects the apparent magnitude. Extinction in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So 3.1 *0.6=1.86. So the star's actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5 - 1.86 =13.64. So that's much brighter than 16. So the observed apparent mag (with extinction) is 15.5, but without extinction it's 13.64.
