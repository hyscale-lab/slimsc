Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰.

Alright, let me read the problem again. X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are about the resolution in meters, varying from 1e-9 to 1e-1.

Wait, so I'm thinking this is a question about relativistic particle decay and the proper lifetime. I remember that the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime because of time dilation. So the formula should be τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the problem is about the chamber's ability to observe the decay. I think the resolution refers to the minimum time that the chamber can distinguish between events. Or wait, maybe it's about the spatial resolution? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the problem says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait—maybe it's the minimum time resolution required to measure the decay, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the minimum length over which the decay products can be detected.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up some concepts. Let's think again. The Bubble Chamber is a detector that can only resolve particles that travel a certain minimum distance before decaying. If the decay happens too quickly, the particles might not travel far enough for the chamber to detect them. So the minimum resolution (maybe the minimum distance the decay products travel) would relate to the proper lifetime.

So, the proper lifetime is τ₀. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so τ = γ τ₀. The particle's speed would be close to the speed of light, so the distance it travels before decaying is L = v * τ. But for particles moving at relativistic speeds, v ≈ c.

Wait, but I need to find the minimum resolution, which I think is the minimum distance the decay products have to travel so that the chamber can detect at least 30% of the decays. So, perhaps 30% of the particles decay within a certain distance, and the chamber must have a resolution good enough to detect that. Or maybe it's the minimum distance such that 30% of the particles decay within that distance, so we can see them.

Wait, but how does the resolution come into play? I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the process.

First, calculate the Lorentz factor γ. The energy of the particle is given as E = 27 GeV. The mass of X⁰ is m = 3.41 GeV. So, the energy E is related to γ and m by E = γ m c². So, γ = E/(m c²). But since m and E are given in GeV, and c² is in (GeV·fm)/(GeV)²? Wait, maybe I don't need to worry about units here because the c² would be part of the energy-mass relation.

Wait, let's compute γ. E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²). But since m c² is E_rest, which is m = 3.41 GeV/c² → m c² = 3.41 GeV.

So, E = 27 GeV. So γ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. So approximately 7.92.

Now, τ (lab frame lifetime) is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.917 * 8e-16 s = approx 63.34
