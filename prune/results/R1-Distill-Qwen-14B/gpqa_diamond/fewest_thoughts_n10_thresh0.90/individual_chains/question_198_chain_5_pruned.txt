Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'm determined to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the problem again and jot down the key details.

The problem says we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Hmm, wait, dithiocyanato—so that's Co with two SCN- ligands. I think the complexes would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n-) where n is the number of ligands. So the different β values are for different complexes. Let me note down what each β represents. 

Stability constant β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. For each Co complex, let's see:

β1 is probably for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]+. Because each βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So, each subsequent βn is for a higher order complex. But wait, the β's don't necessarily increase. Oh, β4 is 16 which is lower than β3. Interesting.

So the complexes would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ (β1=9)
[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2] (β2=40? Wait no, wait. Wait, the formation constant for the second complex would be β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN][SCN]). But since β's are given, each step's β is the cumulative product. Or wait, maybe each β is the total stability for each step. Hmm, I might need to think about that.

Wait, I think the stability constants are given for each step. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, β2 for the second step, and so on. So the overall β for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, no. Actually, the stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+) is the overall constant, which is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. Or maybe each βn is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth ligand. So, the overall formation constant K_n for [Co(SCN)_n]^2− would be β1 * β2 * β3 * ... * βn.

Wait, but in the problem, the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So perhaps these are the cumulative stability constants for [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^-2. Hmm, not sure. But I think that each βn is the overall constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that. Let's say:

[Co(SCN)]^+ has β1=9.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 has β2=40.

Wait no, no, wait. Because each βn is the formation constant for each step. So:

The first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ → K1 = β1 =9.

The second step is [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → K2 = β2=40.

Third step: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^- → K3=β3=63.

Fourth step: [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^-2 → K4=β4=16.

So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of K1*K2*...*Kn. So for the first complex, K1=9. For the second, K1*K2=9*40=360. For the third, 9*40*63=22680. For the fourth, 9*40*63*16=221760.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the β values are stepwise or cumulative. The problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." I think each βn is the cumulative constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is [CoSCN+]/(Co^2+ SCN^-) =9. β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]/(Co^2+ (SCN^-)^2) =40. β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]/(Co^2+ (SCN^-)^3)=63. β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]/(Co^2+ (SCN^-)^4)=16.

Wait, but if that's the case, then each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex, not the stepwise.

I think that's the right approach. So when the problem gives β1, β2, etc., they are the overall stability constants for the complexes with 1,2,3,4 SCN- ligands respectively.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Because the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, right? Or perhaps I'm mixing up colors. Wait, cobalt complexes with different ligands have different colors. Hexaaquacobalt(II) is pink, and thiocyanato complexes can be blue or another color depending on the number of ligands.

Wait, I think the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands. So the species [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the blue one. So we're to find the percentage of this species relative to all cobalt species.

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] in the solution.

The total concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. So we need to find the fraction of Co in the [Co(SCN)_2] form.

The general approach is to model the distribution of Co between the different complexes. Each complex [Co(SCN)_n] has a concentration that depends on the stability constant βn and the concentrations of SCN-.

The general equation is:

Co^2+ can form [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^-2.

So the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these complexes plus any uncomplexed Co^2+.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, our total Co is 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all Co species, including the free Co^2+ and all complexes.

So, [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^-2] = 1e-2 M.

But wait, no, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co)=1e-2 M. So that sum equals 1e-2.

But given that the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the total Co concentration, perhaps the free SCN- is approximately 0.1 M.

So, to model this, the approach is to compute the concentration of each complex, and then find the fraction that is [Co(SCN)_2^0].

Let me denote S as the concentration of free SCN^- which is approximately 0.1 M, given that the total Co is 1e-2 M, and each Co can bind up to 4 SCN- ions. The maximum possible [SCN] consumed by Co is 4 * 1e-2 = 0.04 M. Since the initial SCN- is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 - 0.04 = 0.06 M left, but in solution, the free SCN- can be approximated as 0.1 M, especially if the complexation isn't too extensive. But maybe we can't ignore it, but perhaps it's a reasonable approximation. Alternatively, since the concentration of SCN- is much higher than Co, the free [SCN] is approximately 0.1 M.

So, the concentration of each complex is given by:

[ [Co(SCN)_n] ] = [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n * βn 

But wait, no. Each βn is the stability constant, which is [Co(SCN)_n]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). So rearranged, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, the concentration of each complex is proportional to βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

But since [Co^2+] is the same for all, we can think of it as a common factor.

Wait, let me think again. The total concentration of Co is the sum of [Co^2+] plus all the complexes. So:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n] 

But each [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So,

Total Co = [Co^2+] + [Co^2+] (β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Factor out [Co^2+]:

Total Co = [Co^2+] [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ]

We can solve for [Co^2+]:

[Co^2+] = Total Co / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can compute each [Co(SCN)_n] as βn [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

But wait, the denominator is a sum of terms where each term is βn [SCN]^n.

Let me compute the denominator first.

Given:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2 [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3 [SCN]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3 =63*0.001=0.063

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum these terms plus 1 (the [Co^2+] term):

Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's compute:

1 +0.9=1.9
1.9+0.4=2.3
2.3 +0.063=2.363
2.363 +0.0016≈2.3646.

So denominator ≈2.3646.

Total Co is 1e-2 M. So [Co^2+] = 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Wait, let me compute that:

1e-2 is 0.01.

0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

So [Co^2+] ≈ 4.225e-3 M.

Now, compute each [Co(SCN)_n]:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN] =9 * 4.225e-3 *0.1.

Let me compute that: 9 *4.225e-3= 0.038025, multiplied by 0.1: 0.0038025 M.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 =40 *4.225e-3*(0.1)^2.

Compute (0.1)^2=0.01. So 40 *4.225e-3 *0.01 =40 * 4.225e-5 = 0.000169 M.

Wait, 4.225e-3 is 0.004225. So 40 *0.004225 =0.169, multiplied by 0.01 gives 0.00169.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me compute it again.

Wait, [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^2.

β2=40, [Co^2+]=4.225e-3, [SCN]=0.1.

So 40 * 4.225e-3 = 0.169. Then multiplied by (0.1)^2=0.01.

So 0.169 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^3 =63 *4.225e-3 * (0.1)^3.

(0.1)^3=0.001.

63 *4.225e-3 = 0.266025. Multiply by 0.001 → 0.000266025 M.

[Co(SCN)_4^-2] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^4=16 *4.225e-3*(0.1)^4.

(0.1)^4=0.0001.

16 *4.225e-3 = 0.0676. Multiply by 0.0001 → 0.00000676 M.

Now, let's list all concentrations:

[Co^2+] =4.225e-3 M.

[CoSCN^+] =0.0038025 M.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] =0.00169 M.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] =0.000266025 M.

[Co(SCN)_4^-2] =0.00000676 M.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the calculations step by step.

Wait, when I computed [CoSCN^+], β1=9, so 9 * 4.225e-3 * 0.1.

9 *4.225e-3 = 0.038025.

Multiply by 0.1 → 0.0038025 M.

Yes, that's correct.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] is 40 *4.225e-3 * (0.1)^2.

0.1^2=0.01.

40 *4.225e-3 = 0.169.

0.169 * 0.01 = 0.00169.

Yes.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] is 63 *4.225e-3 *0.001.

63 *4.225e-3 = 0.266025.

0.266025 *0.001=0.000266025.

Yes.

[Co(SCN)_4^-2] is 16 *4.225e-3 *0.0001.

16 *4.225e-3 = 0.0676.

0.0676 *0.0001=0.00000676.

Yes.

Now, let's sum all the concentrations to check if they add up to 1e-2 M.

Sum:

4.225e-3 (≈0.004225) +

0.0038025 → 0.004225 +0.0038025 = 0.0080275.

+0.00169 → 0.0097175.

+0.000266 → 0.0099835.

+0.00000676 → ~0.00999026.

Wait, but the total should be 0.01 M. Hmm, it's close but not exactly. I think this is because I approximated [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, but in reality, some SCN^- is consumed by the complexes. But given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M and the total Co is 0.01 M, and each Co can take up to 4 SCN, the total consumed is 0.04 M. So free [SCN^-] would be 0.06 M. But if we consider that, the calculations get more complicated.

But maybe for this problem, the approximation holds because the SCN^- is in large excess, so the free [SCN^-] remains approximately 0.1 M.

Let me proceed with the initial calculation.

The concentration of the blue dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2^0] =0.00169 M.

The total Co concentration is 0.01 M, so the fraction is 0.00169 / 0.01 =0.169 → 16.9%.

Wait, but that's one of the options, option D)16.9%.

But wait, I thought the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but is that correct? Because sometimes, the hexaaqua is pink, and thiocyanato complexes can vary. But the question says the blue is the dithiocyanato, which is two SCN-.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is wrong because the denominator in the calculations for [Co^2+] is wrong. Let me double-check that.

Wait, the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Which I calculated as 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.

So [Co^2+] =0.01 / 2.3646 = ~0.004225 M.

Wait, but perhaps I should also include the possibility of higher complexes. Or perhaps the assumption that the free [SCN] is 0.1 M isn't correct. But given the problem, I think that's acceptable.

So according to this, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M, which is 16.9% of the total cobalt.

Looking at the options, that's option D.

But wait, wait, let me think again. The [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M, and the total is 0.01 M. So 0.00169 /0.01 =0.169 →16.9% → option D.

Hmm, but I remember that sometimes in such calculations, the denominator is the sum of all possible species, including higher complexes, which can affect the result. Let me make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, the denominator is 1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4. So I think that's correct.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given as log βn, but no, the problem gives βn as 9,40, etc. So they are actual K values, not log K.

Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is the fourth one, but that would be blue? I'm not sure. Wait, the question says the blue is the dithiocyanato, which would be two SCN- ligands, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, but in my calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M, which is 16.9% of the total. So the answer should be D.

But I see that option C is 38%, which is about twice as much. Maybe I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator.

β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 [S]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

β3 [S]^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

β4 [S]^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all these terms plus 1:

1 +0.9=1.9.

+0.4 →2.3.

+0.063→2.363.

+0.0016→2.3646.

Yes, that's correct.

So [Co^2+] is 0.01 /2.3646 ≈
