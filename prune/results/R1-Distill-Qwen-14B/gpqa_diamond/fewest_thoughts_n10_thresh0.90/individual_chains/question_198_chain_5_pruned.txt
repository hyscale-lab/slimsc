Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is blue. But I'm not 100% sure. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), right? Because each SCN- is a -1 charge, so n SCN would give a charge of 2-n for Co^2+.

So the different complexes are:

- Co^2+ (n=0, [Co])
- Co(SCN)^(+) (n=1)
- Co(SCN)_2^0 (n=2)
- Co(SCN)_3^(-) (n=3)
- Co(SCN)_4^(2-) (n=4)

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the charges. Let me think. The Co^2+ ion has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. For each complex, the charge would be 2 - (n * 1), because each SCN- is -1. So for n=1, 2-1=+1, so [Co(SCN)]^+.

For n=2, 2-2(1) = 0, so Co(SCN)_2 is neutral.

n=3: 2-3= -1, so [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

n=4: 2-4= -2, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So the complexes are Co^{2+}, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3^-, Co(SCN)_4^{2-}.

The stability constants, β, are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, the beta values correspond to each step, right? Or are they the overall formation constants?

Stability constants (formation constants) typically refer to the overall process. So for each complex, the β is the cumulative constant for the formation of that complex from the previous one.

Wait, no. Usually, βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

So each βn is K for the reaction:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.

So, the formation constant for each complex is βn.

Hmm, but wait, sometimes β is used for the stepwise formation constants. Like β1 is the first step: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ with K1=β1.

Then β2 would be the second step: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 with K2=β2.

Wait, but in that case, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2] would be K1*K2=β1*β2.

Oh wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. The problem says the "stability constants" are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So I think βn here refers to the cumulative formation constant for the nth complex. So:

β1 = K1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

β2 = K1*K2= [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) =40.

Similarly, β3=K1*K2*K3=63.

β4= K1*K2*K3*K4=16.

Wait, but that would make β4 the smallest among β1, β2, β3, which is a bit odd because usually, higher complexes have higher stability constants. But perhaps this isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe each βn is the stepwise formation constant. So for each step, adding another ligand. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex is product of β1 to βn.

Wait, I think that's the correct approach. So for example, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So for [Co(SCN)_1]^+:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0:

β1 * β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) =9 *40=360.

Similarly, β1*β2*β3=9*40*63= 22680.

And β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but that would mean that the highest overall β is for the fourth complex, which seems a bit counterintuitive, but perhaps that's correct.

But wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16." So perhaps each βn is the stepwise formation constant for each additional ligand. So β1 is for the first ligand (Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+), β2 is the second ligand ([CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0), etc.

In that case, the overall formation constant for each complex would be the product of β1 through βn.

So for the first complex, K1 = β1 =9.

For the second, K2=β1 * β2=9 *40=360.

Third, K3= β1 * β2 * β3=9*40*63=22680.

Fourth, K4= β1 * β2 * β3 * β4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, that's a huge number, but okay.

Now, the problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Assuming that refers to [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the neutral complex with two SCN ligands. So we need to find the fraction of Co in this form.

So, the approach would be to calculate the distribution of Co among all possible complexes, and then find the percentage that is in the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 form.

The general approach for such problems is to consider all possible complexes (from n=0 to n=4) and their concentrations, given the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN-.

But wait, the
