Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see what the data says.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, calculating the degree of unsaturation might help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which accounts for 3: a six-membered ring with three double bonds), a carbonyl group (another one), and an amide or something else (another double bond? Or maybe an amine). Or maybe it's a ring plus some double bonds and a carbonyl.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually N-H stretches. Since they're medium to strong intensity, maybe it's an amide or an amine. Wait, but amides typically have N-H stretches around 3300-3500. So if there's a strong band at 1720, that's probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or an amide. But wait, amides usually have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1650 cm-1, because of resonance. So if it's 1720, perhaps it's an ester, or maybe a ketone. But with the presence of N, maybe an amide? Or maybe an ester and an amine.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group. Like an ethyl group attached to something else. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet could be an -OCH2- group, but the integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe an NH2 as a broad peak, but the integration is 2H here, which might not fit with an amine. Wait, but the IR showed N-H stretches, so maybe it's an amide or a secondary amine. Hmm, but the singlet at 4.0 might be OCH2, especially if it's an ethyl ester.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. A quartet usually comes from a CH2 next to another CH2. So maybe an OCH2CH2O structure? Or perhaps an ester group where OCH2 is next to another CH2. Wait, if it's ethyl ester, like OCH2CH3, but the 4.5 quartet is 2H, which might be the CH2 connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) is likely the CH3 of an ethyl group. So maybe the structure has an ethyl ester group, like OCH2CH3. Then the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) would be the OCH2 connected to the carbonyl.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the doublets each have 2H and are around 7 and 8 ppm. So maybe the substituent is electron-withdrawing, like a carbonyl group or an ester.

Putting this together: perhaps it's an ester of a benzoic acid derivative. Wait, but let's look at the options.

Options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide means an amide attached to benzene. 3-ethoxy would mean an ethoxy group in the meta position. The IR would have N-H stretch for amide, which matches. The NMR: ethoxy group (CH2CH3) as triplet at 1.2, and OCH2 somewhere else? Wait, benzamide would have a CONH2 group. But let's look at the NMR signals.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: formamide is HCONH2. So the IR would have N-H, which is consistent. The ethoxy group would be at 1.20 triplet, 3H. The OCH2 would be at around 4.0 ppm. The formamide would have a carbonyl at ~1720? Maybe. The aromatic would be 4-ethoxy, so para substitution, and the formamide would be in the para position? Or wait, the formamide
