Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and trying to understand each part.

The problem is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y, which produces gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4°C. I remember that water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so maybe B is something that's just a bit higher but still a solid under normal conditions. Hmm, maybe it's ice? No, wait, ice is H2O, but 277 K is just a bit above freezing, so maybe B is another substance that's solid around that temperature, like maybe something else with a similar melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is a different form of water, but I'm not sure.

Then, the gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. That's an interesting clue. Let's think: for a molecule, the number of protons and neutrons being the same suggests that the nucleus has an equal number of each. Wait, but wait, W is a gas, so maybe it's a light gas. Let me think about common gases. Hydrogen, helium, maybe CO2, but that's a solid. Oh, wait, O2 or N2? Let's see: O2 has 8 protons each, so two atoms would have 16 protons. Neutrons: oxygen has 8 neutrons in O-16. So each O atom has 8 neutrons. So for O2, total protons are 16, total neutrons are 16. So that fits: protons equal to neutrons. So gas W could be O2? Or maybe another gas. Wait, nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 neutrons in N-14, but N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So N2 also fits. Hmm, so W might be O2 or N2. Or maybe another diatomic gas. Let's keep that in mind.

The reaction is violent between X and Y. So maybe a strong acid reacting with a metal? Or something like that. But I'm not sure yet. Let's think more about the products.

When G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate and when heated, it decomposes into B, maybe CO2 and something else. Wait, if B is a solid with a melting point near 277 K, maybe it's something like NaCl, but no, that's way higher. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal oxide? Not sure yet.

The problem also mentions that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, so if the product is a molecule with 2 O atoms, perhaps it's something like H2O2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a salt with two oxygen atoms. Wait, but the product is formed when a keto acid reacts with X. Keto acids are like ketone-containing acids, such as acetoacetic acid or something similar. Maybe when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has O2 in it. But I'm not certain yet.

Looking at the first part again: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope that's heavier, implying that one of its elements has a higher atomic mass. For example, Cl has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if X is something like sodium chloride, maybe it has Cl-37 instead of Cl-35. But what reactions would sodium chloride undergo? It doesn't react much with acids, unless maybe it's a concentrated acid and they are reacting violently.

Wait, the reaction is violent between X and Y, producing W, a gas. If X is a metal, maybe it's reacting with an acid. But wait, if X is a metal, it would react with acid to produce H2 gas. But earlier, I thought W could be O2 or N2. But if W is H2, that doesn't fit the neutron-proton condition. H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. So maybe W is CO2? No, because CO2 has 12 protons (from C) and 16 (from O2), but the total protons and neutrons in the molecule would be 12 + 16 = 28 protons, and 12 (C) has 6 neutrons, each O has 8, so 2*8=16; total neutrons would be 6 + 16 = 22? No, that doesn't sum up. So maybe W is another gas.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule of gas W has equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible molecules. Let's consider the possible atoms where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. For example, carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. So if W is CO2, each C is 12, each O is 16. Wait, but CO2 has 1 C and 2 O, so total protons would be 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22. Neutrons would be 6 (C) + 2*(8) = 22. Oh wait, wait! So for CO2: each C atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's C-12). Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So the total protons in CO2 would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Total neutrons would be 6 + 2*(8) = 22. So yes, CO2 fits the description. So W could be CO2. But wait, under standard conditions, CO2 is a gas (well, a solid at low pressures?), no, wait, no, CO2 is a gas at standard temperature and pressure. So that could be W.

So if W is CO2, that gives us some clues. Then the reaction between X and Y is producing CO2, perhaps. So what reaction produces CO2? Maybe decomposition of a carbonate. Or maybe oxidation. Or perhaps a reaction between a metal carbonate and an acid. Wait, but then Y could be an acid. Let's think: If X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid, their reaction would produce CO2 gas, water, and the corresponding salt. But the problem says the reaction is violent, so maybe it's a strong acid
