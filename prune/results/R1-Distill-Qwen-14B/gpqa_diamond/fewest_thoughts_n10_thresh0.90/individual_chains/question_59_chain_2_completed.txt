Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. 

Wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can react. So first, I need to figure out what's happening when these substances are mixed.

Let me start by writing down the given data. The volumes and concentrations are:
- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base involved because reactions depend on mole ratios.

Moles are calculated by Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters.

So for CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.
Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? It dissociates completely in water. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let's think about the reactions. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, giving H+ ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely.

But when you mix acids and bases, the H+ ions will neutralize the OH- ions.

So first, let's figure out the total H+ and OH-.

H+ comes from HCl and any excess from CH3COOH if it isn't neutralized. Wait, but actually, HCl is a strong acid and will donate all its H+. CH3COOH is weak, but it can donate some H+ as well, but maybe if there's excess OH-, it might affect that.

But let's proceed step by step.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix H+ and OH-, they'll react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other.

So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, OH- is 0.18 moles. So 0.08 moles of OH- will react with 0.08 moles of H+.

That leaves (0.18 - 0.08) = 0.10 moles of OH- unreacted.

Wait, but wait a second. After neutralizing the H+ from HCl, the excess OH- will then react with any other H+ sources. Oh right, but CH3COOH is a weak acid which doesn't give up all its H+.

So after the HCl and Ba(OH)2 have reacted, the remaining OH- will be 0.10 moles.

But wait, there's also the CH3COOH solution. The acetic acid might provide some H+ to react with the excess OH-.

So, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. So, after neutralizing, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Now, these OH- will react with the acetic acid's H+.

But wait, the acetic acid is a weak acid. Its dissociation is not complete. So the initial moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 moles. But how much H+ can it provide? Let's think.

In a solution, CH3COOH can donate some H+ ions, but not all. So in the presence of excess OH-, which is a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid. So the reaction would be: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, the OH- will take H+ from the acetic acid. So the 0.10 moles of OH- will react with the 0.05 moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let's see: 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. So, the OH- will react with all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving (0.10 - 0.05) = 0.05 moles of OH- unreacted.

So after all reactions, we have 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I have the stoichiometry right.

The reaction is:

Ba(OH)2 + 2 HCl → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Wait, no, because when you mix Ba(OH)2 and HCl, they will neutralize each other.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, HCl is a strong acid. The reaction is:

Ba(OH)2 + 2 HCl → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So, each mole of Ba(OH)2 reacts with 2 moles of HCl.

So, let's compute the moles involved.

Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles.
HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles ratio: 1 Ba(OH)2 : 2 HCl.

So, Ba(OH)2 can react with 0.18 moles of HCl (since 0.09 *2=0.18). But we only have 0.08 moles of HCl.

So, HCl is the limiting reagent here.

So, how much Ba(OH)2 reacts with HCl?

Moles HCl = 0.08. Ba(OH)2 needed is 0.08 / 2 = 0.04 moles.

So, after reaction, remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 -0.04=0.05 moles.

Which will yield 0.05 *2=0.10 moles of OH-.

So, the OH- from unreacted Ba(OH)2 is 0.10 moles.

Plus, any OH- from other sources?

Wait, the other solution is CH3COOH. Now, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid. The reaction between OH- and CH3COOH is:

OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, moles OH- available: 0.10.

Moles CH3COOH: 0.05.

So, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react, consuming 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, remaining OH-: 0.10 -0.05=0.05 moles.

So, after all reactions, we're left with 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. The problem is that the OH- is in the solution, so we can calculate the concentration of OH- and then find pH.

But first, let's compute the total volume of the solution.

The volumes are 500 mL, 400 mL, and 300 mL. So total volume is 500+400+300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.041666... M.

Then, pOH is -log(0.041666...).

Wait, calculating that. Let me compute it.

The concentration is approximately 0.04167 M.

log(0.04167) is log(4.167e-2).

Log(4.167) is about 0.620, so log(4.167e-2)=0.620 -2= -1.380.

So, pOH is 1.380.

Then, pH is 14 - pOH = 14 -1.380 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial reaction between Ba(OH)2 and HCl: Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 moles, HCl is 0.08 moles.

HCl needs 2 moles per 1 mole of Ba(OH)2.

So, moles of Ba(OH)2 that can react with HCl is 0.08 /2 =0.04.

So, after reaction, moles of Ba(OH)2 remaining is 0.09 -0.04=0.05.

Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.05 *2=0.10 moles OH-.

Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH has 0.05 moles, so all of it reacts, and OH- is 0.05 left.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05.

Total solution volume is 1.2 L.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 /1.2 = 0.041666... M.

pOH = -log(0.041666) ≈ 1.38.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I thought pOH is -log[OH-], so 0.041666.

What's the log of 0.041666?

Let me compute it more accurately.

0.041666 is 1/24 approximately.

Log(24) is about 1.3802. So log(1/24) is -1.3802.

So, pOH is 1.3802.

So, pH is 14 -1.3802=12.6198, which is approximately 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I account for all the sources of H+ and OH- correctly?

Let me think again.

HCl is a strong acid, so it donates all H+ (0.08 moles). Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it donates all OH- (initially 0.18 moles).

They react in a 2:1 ratio of HCl to Ba(OH)2.

Wait, no, in the reaction equation, Ba(OH)2 + 2 HCl → products.

So, per mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 moles of HCl are needed.

So, with 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2 and 0.08 moles HCl, the limiting reagent is HCl.

So, Ba(OH)2 reacted is 0.04 moles, leaving 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.10 moles OH-.

Then, this OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which has 0.05 moles. So all CH3COOH is consumed, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

So yes, the calculation is correct.

Another thought: if there's any excess H+ left, that could change things. But in this case, all the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH are neutralized by OH-.

Wait, the CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in pure solution, it would donate some H+.

But here, after mixing with OH-, the OH- will deprotonate it, right?

So, in the presence of excess OH-, the CH3COOH will donate its H+ and become CH3COO^-.

So, the remaining solution has OH- and the acetate ions.

So, the solution is basic because of the excess OH-.

So, the pH is about 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the reaction between the given acids and bases:

### Given Data:
- **CH₃COOH**: 500 mL of 0.1 M → Moles = \( 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \)
- **HCl**: 400 mL of 0.2 M → Moles = \( 0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \)
- **Ba(OH)₂**: 300 mL of 0.3 M → Moles = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \)

### Step 1: Reaction Between Ba(OH)₂ and HCl
Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, and HCl is a strong acid. They react in a 1:2 molar ratio:
\[
\text{Ba(OH)}_2 + 2 \, \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{BaCl}_2 + 2 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]
- Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.09 \)
- Moles of HCl = \( 0.08 \)

Since HCl is the limiting reagent, it reacts completely with \( \frac{0.08}{2} = 0.04 \, \text{moles of Ba(OH)}_2 \). This leaves:
\[
\text{Remaining Ba(OH)}_2 = 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 \, \text{moles}
\]
Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so the remaining OH⁻ moles are:
\[
0.05 \times 2 = 0.10 \, \text{moles}
\]

### Step 2: Reaction Between OH⁻ and CH₃COOH
CH₃COOH is a weak acid, and OH⁻ reacts with it:
\[
\text{OH}^- + \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]
- Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \)
- Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.10 \)

CH₃COOH is completely consumed, leaving:
\[
\text{Remaining OH}^- = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and pOH
The total volume of the solution is:
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}
\]
The concentration of OH⁻ is:
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of OH}^-}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} = 0.041666 \, \text{M}
\]
The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.041666) \approx 1.38
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
Using the relationship \( \text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14 \):
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.

**Answer: A**
