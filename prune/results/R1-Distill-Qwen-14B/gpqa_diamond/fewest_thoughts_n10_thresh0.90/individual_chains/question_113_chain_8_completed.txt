Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an organic compound based on various spectroscopic data. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what each of these techniques tells us.

First, the FTIR spectrum. They mentioned a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region are usually indicative of O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong, broad O-H stretch. So maybe that's a clue. Also, they have two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or something like that. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe an amide or conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe that's a C=O in a conjugated system or an aromatic ring with substituents.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has at least one double bond. Also, the presence of multiple peaks suggests perhaps more than one environment, maybe different substituents around the double bond or different coupling partners.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I know that m/z 45 is a common fragment, often indicative of a (CH3)2CO group, like an acetone fragment. Alternatively, it could be from something like a ketone or another carbonyl-containing structure. Wait, another possibility is that 45 is the molecular ion of something like (CH3)2CO, which is acetone with a molecular weight of 58. But maybe the fragment is breaking off a part of the molecule, leaving a smaller ion.

Now, looking at the options, the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation for each:

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) formula: DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here.

Option A: C6H12O2. So C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So 1 DoU. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond, etc.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoUs. Maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14 -10)/2=2. So two DoUs. Similar possibilities as B.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14 -12)/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond, so at least one DoU from that. The IR has a carbonyl at 1700, which is another DoU. So that's two DoUs. So the compound must have at least two DoUs. Wait, but some of the options have less than that.

Looking again, the options with two DoUs are B (C6H10O) and C (C6H10O2). Because option B has H=10: DoU 2. Option C has H=10, O=2: DoU 2. Options A and D have DoU 1, which would only account for one of the two DoUs we have (the double bond and carbonyl). So, which of B or C is the right one?

Wait, the FTIR shows a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So the molecule must have a carbonyl group. So, looking at the possible functional groups, if it's an ester, which has two oxygen atoms, that would fit option C (C6H10O2). Alternatively, a ketone would have one O (option B or D).

But wait, another IR peak at 1650. That's a lower wavenumber than 1700. Maybe that's an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl or an amide? Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone? In that case, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might absorb at 1650.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a carbonyl group in a different environment. Another thought: maybe it's an ester with a carbonyl at 1700 (esters usually around 1730-1700) and another peak from an adjacent group, like conjugated double bond or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, the presence of vinyl protons suggests an alkene, which is a DoU. So the two DoUs would be the carbonyl (C=O) and the alkene (C=C). So the molecule would have both a C=O and a C=C.

Looking at the options, which have two DoUs. So either B or C. Let's think about the functional groups.

If the molecule has both a C=O and a C=C, then maybe it's a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. Or maybe a cyclic ester.

But considering the options, let's think about the molecular formula. Let's see the molecular weights.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(16) =72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. (6*12)+(10)+(32)=72+10+32=114.

So the molecular ion would be around 98 or 114. But the mass spec shows a fragment at 45. Let's think about how that fragment could form.

A fragment at 45 could be from a ketone group (like acetone, which is (CH3)2CO, molecular weight 58. So if the molecule breaks off a part, perhaps the rest is 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from something else.

Wait, another approach: maybe the compound is an ester. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R'. So for example, ethyl acetate is C4H8O2. But our compound is C6H10O2 (option C), which would have a larger ester.

Alternatively, if the compound is a cyclic ester, that's a lactone. But I'm not sure if that would necessarily produce a fragment at 45.

Wait, another thought: the mass spec fragment at 45 could be from a (CH3)2CO group. Let me check the molecular weight of that: (2*CH3) + CO. CH3 is 15 each, so 2*15=30, plus CO (28) gives 58. But 45 is less than that. Hmm, maybe it's another structure.

Wait, 45 could be a CH2=CHCO group (but that would be 56, I think). Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2CO group, but that's not correct. Let me think of common fragments with m/z 45.

Another possibility: the fragment could be a CH3COO- group. Wait, the acetate ion is 60 (CH3COO- is 60, but that's a fragment at m/z 60, not 45). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a different part. Let me think of what gives 45. 45 is 9*5, so maybe a benzyl group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2CH2COOH? No, that's heavier. Alternatively, maybe a smaller fragment, like a CH2CH2CO group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The molecular formula of the compound must be one of the options. Let me think about the options and their possible structures.

Option C is C6H10O2. That's two oxygen atoms. So perhaps an ester, which is R-O-CO-R'. The ester group would give a carbonyl peak around 1700. That fits the IR data. The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR could be from an alkene, perhaps part of the ester or another group.

If the structure is an ester with a double bond, like maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like methyl acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let's see the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH3 is C4H6O2. But our option C is C6H10O2, which is a bigger molecule.

Alternatively, maybe a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. For instance, if it's a six-membered ring with an ester substituent, that would fit C6H10O2. Wait, the formula of cyclohexene is C6H10. So if it's cyclohexene with an ester group, that would add two oxygen atoms and perhaps adjust the H count.

Wait, suppose the compound is something like methyl cyclohex-2-ene-1-carboxylate. Let's count the atoms: cyclohexene is C6H10. If we add a COOCH3 group, which is COOCH3. The formula would be C6H10O2 plus the methyl ester. Wait, the original cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding a COOCH3 would give C6+2= C8? Wait no, maybe I should think about the starting material. Maybe it's a cyclohexene ring with an ester group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester or something else.

But back to the spectroscopic data. The FTIR shows a broad peak around 3000, which I thought was O-H. But wait, esters don't have O-H groups (they have O-R and O-CO-O, but the O-H is in the acid, which is not present in an ester). So if the IR has a broad O-H peak, that might indicate an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid (RCOOH), the O-H would be very broad and strong around 2500-3300 cm-1. But the IR here shows a broad peak at 3000, which is a bit lower than typical for a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H is usually a broad peak around 3300-3500. Wait, maybe that's a stretch. Wait, the given peak is at 3000, which is lower than typical for alcohols. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated O-H, like in a phenol. Phenols have O-H stretches around 3200-3600, but can be lower if conjugated. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol tautomer, but that's more complicated.

Wait, but the options include O and O2. So if there's a broad peak at 3000, maybe it's an alcohol or a phenol. But if the compound has an ester group, then where would the O-H come from? Maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is not an O-H. Wait, another possibility for a broad peak around 3000 is an N-H stretch, but the question doesn't mention any amines. So maybe it's not that. Alternatively, maybe it's a C-O stretch, but those are usually around 1250 or so. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the broad peak isn't O-H—could it be something else? Another possibility is that the 3000 cm-1 is an alkyne C-H stretch, but those are usually around 3300. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic C-H stretch, but those are usually around 3000-3100, and might not be as broad.

Wait, but alkenes have C-H stretches around 3000 cm-1. But those are usually less intense and not as broad. A broad peak suggests something with hydrogen bonding, like O-H.

Hmm, perhaps the presence of both O-H and a carbonyl. So if the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group, or an ester with an alcohol? Wait, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is an acid derivative, like an anhydride. But anhydrides typically have two carbonyl peaks, but I'm not sure about the IR.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something with an O-H.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, which is a lactone. In that case, the O-H would be part of the ester linkage, but I don't think lactones have O-H groups unless they're opened. Wait, no, lactones are cyclic esters, so they don't have free O-H groups. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has both an ester and an alcohol group. That would require more oxygen. Let's see the options. Option C is C6H10O2. So two oxygen atoms: that could be an ester (O and O in the ester group) and maybe an alcohol. Wait, no, that would need three O's if both groups are present. Wait, an ester has two O's, so if the compound has an ester group and an alcohol group, that would require three O's. So that can't be, because option C has two O's. So perhaps not.

Wait, but maybe the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has both a ketone and an ester group. Let me think: for example, ethyl acetoacetate is a beta-keto ester, which would have O's.

Ethyl acetoacetate has the formula C5H8O3. But our options don't have three O's. So perhaps not.

Hmm, maybe the O-H is an alcohol group. So if the compound has an ester and an alcohol, but that would require three O's, which isn't any of the options. So maybe the O-H is from something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol, but that would require more H's.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is not O-H. Another possibility is that the compound has an aromatic ring with strong absorption in that region, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but the question doesn't mention any amines.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a carboxylic acid. Then the formula would have O2 as in option C or A.

But if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would be RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. So for a six carbon acid, it would be C6H12O2 (which is option A), but that would have a higher H count. Wait, our options are C6H12O2 (A), C6H10O (B), C6H10O2 (C), C6H12O (D).

Wait, a carboxylic acid would have the formula C6H12O2. So that's option A. But then, the IR would show a very broad O-H around 2500-3500 cm-1. Also, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 cm-1. So that fits the IR data: peaks at 1700 and 1650. Wait, but why the 1650? Maybe a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

The 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so an alkene is present. If it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that would fit. So the formula would be C6H12O2 (option A), which has a DoU of 1. But wait, earlier I thought that the compound has two DoUs (from the double bond and the carbonyl). Option A has a DoU of 1, which would account for either a ring or a double bond. But if the compound has both a double bond and a carbonyl, that's two DoUs, which would require a formula with two DoUs, which would be either B or C.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize.

IR: broad peak at 3000 (probably O-H), strong peaks at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (maybe a conjugated C=O or C=C or something else).

NMR: vinyl H, so C=C.

Mass: fragment at 45.

Options: the correct formula must have at least two DoUs (C=C and C=O), so B or C.

But the O-H in IR suggests an alcohol or acid or phenol.

If the compound is a diol, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with an alcohol. But that would require more O's.

Wait, maybe the compound is a methyl ester with an allyl group. Let me consider option C, which is C6H10O2. If it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, like methyl cyclohexene carboxylate.

Wait, but cyclohexene is C6H10. If it's cyclohexene with a COOCH3 group, then the formula would be C7H10O2. But the option is C6H10O2, which is six carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclopentene. Let's think of the structure: maybe a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diester, but that's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: the mass fragment at 45. Let me think of the molecular formulas of the options and see if any of their possible fragments would be 45.

For option C, C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114. The fragment at 45 could be from losing a part of the molecule.

Wait, maybe the molecule breaks into two parts. For example, if the molecule is an ester, perhaps the ester group (like O-CO-O) breaks off, leaving a smaller fragment.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from the R group in an ester. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', then R could be something that gives a fragment of 45 when cleaved. Let's calculate what R would be.

The ester group is O-CO-O, which is 16 +12 +16*2 = 68? Wait, no—the molecular weight of the ester group (COO-) is 44 (C:12, O:16 for each O, so COO is 12 + 2*16 =44). So if the whole ester is, say, RCOOR', then when it fragments, one possible fragment is RCOO+ and R' as another. So if the RCOO group is 45, then R would be (45 -44) =1, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly.

Wait, the fragment m/z=45. So, the molecular ion would be higher, and the fragment is 45. So the molecule must have a part that adds up to 45.

Let me think: 45 could be (CH3)2CO. (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is (2*15) + (12 +16) = 30 +28=58. So a fragment of 45 can't be acetone. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2CO. Let's calculate: CH2=14 each, so two would be 28. CO is 28. So 28 +28=56. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe a propyl group? Propyl is C3H7. Molecular weight is 57. Hmm, no.

Another thought: 45 is the molecular weight for (CH3)CO, which is 45? CH3CO has a molecular weight of 12*2 +1*4 +16= 24+4+16=44. Close, but not 45. Alternatively, maybe (CH2)2COH: that would be 12*3 +2*2 +16 +1= 36 +4 +16 +1=57. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something. Hmm, but methyl is 15. To get 45, maybe a CH3COOH fragment? Wait, CH3COOH is 60. No.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be a CH2CH2CO group. Let me calculate. CH2CH2CO is C3H6O. So 3*12=36, 6*1=6, 16=16. 36+6+16=58. No, that's too high.

Hmm, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, which is (CH2)2CO+. Wait, that's 58 again.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2=CHCO+ group. Let me compute: CH2=CHCO is C3H4O. 3*12=36, 4=4, 16=16. 36+4+16=56. No.

Wait, perhaps it's a smaller group. Maybe a CH2=CHCOO- group? No, that's 60.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a benzyl group? Benzyl is C7H7, which is 91, not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a methylene group (CH2) attached to something. But that's too small.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketone group attached to a CH2CH2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a COCH2CH2 group. So CO is 28, CH2CH2 is 28 (12*2 + 1*4 = 24+4=28). So total is 56. No.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think of the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. So the fragment at 45 must be a part of this molecule. Let's imagine that the molecule breaks into two parts: one with 45 and the other with 69 (since 114-45=69).

What could the 45 part be? Let's see. 45 is a possible molecular weight for a (CH3)2CO group, but that's 58. Wait, no. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the 45 fragment is a benzene ring with some substituents, but benzene is 78, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an ethyl group with some oxygen. Ethyl is 46, which is close but not 45. Wait, maybe a methyl group with oxygen. Like OCH2CH3 (ethyl ether) is 45? Let me compute: O is 16, CH2CH3 is 15+15=30? Wait, no: CH2CH3 is 12*2 +1*5=24+5=29. So OCH2CH3 is 16+29=45. Oh! So the fragment could be an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3).

If the molecule has an ethoxy group, then perhaps the ester group is present. Because an ester would have an OR group. So if the compound is an ester with ethoxy group, then the fragment would be OCH2CH3, which is 45.

So, for option C, C6H10O2, if the molecule is an ester with ethoxy group, and another part, that fits. Let me think of the structure. For example, ethyl something-ate. Let's say ethyl cyclohex-2-enoate. The formula would be C7H10O2, but our option is C6H10O2. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted ethyl ester with a double bond elsewhere. Let me think. Maybe the ester is ethyl something, and the rest of the molecule has a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is ethyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's compute the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 is C5H8O2. So that's five carbons. Our option is C6H10O2, which is six carbons.

So perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. For example, ethyl cyclohex-2-ene-carboxylate. The formula would be C8H12O2, but that's more than six carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ester is an ortho ester, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a methyl ester with a conjugated double bond. Let's say the structure is CH2CH2COOCH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a six-membered ring with an ester. Maybe a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. For instance, the ring could have five carbons and an ester group. Or perhaps it's a ring with an ester substituent and a double bond in the ring.

Wait, another approach: since the mass fragment is 45, which is OCH2CH3 (ethyl ether group), maybe the compound is an ester where the R group is ethyl. So for example, ethyl something. So the structure would be RCOOCH2CH3. The R group would have C6H10O2 minus the ethyl ester group (which is C2H5O). So RCOO is (C6H10O2 - C2H5O) = (C6H10O2 - C2H5O) = C4H9O. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me recalculate.

The molecular formula is C6H10O2. The ester group is OCOOR. If R is ethyl (C2H5), then OCOOCH2CH3 is C3H6O2. So the remaining part would be C6H10O2 - C3H6O2 = C3H4O. That would make the R group C3H4O. But that's not possible because C3H4O would have a DoU of (2*3 + 2 -4 -0)/2 = (8-4)/2=2. So two DoUs. But with O, maybe a ketone. So R could be CH2COCH3. Hmm, wait, that would make RCOOCH2CH3 as (CH2COCH3)COOCH2CH3. Wait, that's (CH2COCH3)COO is five carbons, plus ethyl makes seven. But our molecular formula is six. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is cyclopropane or something else, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is methyl something. So if the ester is methyl, then RCOOCH3. So the R group would be (C6H10O2 - C2H4O2) = C4H6O? Wait, C6H10O2 minus methyl ester (COOCH3 is C2H6O2). So RCOO- would be C6H10O2 - C2H6O2 = C4H4O0. Wait, that gives R as C4H4, which is impossible. Hmm.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about each option and see which fits all the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so DoU=1 can't account for both the double bond and the carbonyl. So this option is unlikely.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So two DoUs. But the IR shows two peaks: 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (maybe C=C). So this would fit with a ketone and a double bond. But then, the O-H in IR would suggest an alcohol. So if it's a ketone and an alcohol, the formula would have an O. So C6H10O would have a ketone and an alcohol group, which would mean two O's. Wait, no: a ketone has one O, an alcohol has one O. So total O's would be two. So that fits option B, which is C6H10O.

But wait, option B is C6H10O. So if the compound has a ketone (O) and an alcohol (O), that would require two O's. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C. So option B can't be it because it only has one O. Hmm, that's a contradiction.

Wait, no. If the compound is a ketone, that's one O. If it's an alcohol, that's another O. So total O's would be two. Thus, the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C. So option B can't be the correct one because it only has one O.

Therefore, option C is more likely.

Now, the IR shows a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), a strong peak at 1700 (C=O), and 1650. The O-H could be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's an alcohol, then the compound would have both a ketone and an alcohol group, but that would require two O's, which is option C.

So for option C, C6H10O2: possible functional groups are a ketone and an ester (but that would require more O's?), or a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, no. Esters have two O's. So if the compound is an ester, that accounts for two O's, and no alcohol. But then where would the O-H peak come from? Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an ester group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto ester, which has both a ketone and an ester group. Beta-keto esters have the structure RCOCOR'. So for example, ethyl acetoacetate. The formula would be C5H8O3, but our option is C6H10O2.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diketone, but that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from an ester's acidic hydrogen, but that's usually not the case. Esters are generally not very acidic, but under certain conditions, they can lose a proton, but the O-H wouldn't be strong enough to produce a broad peak in IR.

Alternatively, the O-H could be from a phenol group, but the question doesn't suggest any aromatic protons in the NMR.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a hemiacetal, which has both an alcohol and an ester group. But again, that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, but then the formula would need to be C6H12O2 (option A). But option A's DoU is 1, which can't account for the double bond and the carbonyl. So that's a conflict.

Hmm, this is really tricky. Let me try to tie all the clues together.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 (O-H), which suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

The strong peaks at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (maybe conjugated C=O or C=C).

The 1H NMR shows vinyl protons (C=C).

The mass spec shows a fragment at 45, which I'm thinking is OCH2CH3 (ethyl ether group).

So putting this together:

If the compound has an ester group (O-CO-O), which accounts for two O's (option C: C6H10O2), and an ethyl group (OCH2CH3), then the fragment at 45 would make sense. The ester group would give the C=O at 1700. The C=C would give the peak at 1650 and the vinyl H in NMR. The O-H in IR suggests an alcohol, but wait, that doesn't fit with an ester.

Wait, unless the compound is an ethyl ester with an alcohol group elsewhere. But that would require three O's, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H in IR is from a different group, not an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Could it be an enol? Enols have O-H, but they're less common. Enols would show a broad peak in IR, similar to alcohols.

If the compound is an enol ester, which has both an enol (O-H) and an ester group (C=O). That would fit some of the data. But then, how many O's would that be? An enol ester would have the structure RCOCH2CH2O, which has three O's. But our options don't have three O's.

Hmm, perhaps the compound is a dienol, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a phenol group, but I don't have any data indicating aromatic protons in the NMR. The NMR just says 'several peaks including vinyl H's. So maybe the molecule isn't aromatic.

Another thought: the IR peak at 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch, but that would suggest the compound is an aromatic ester with a substituent. But then, the NMR would show signals for aromatic protons, which aren't mentioned. So perhaps the 1650 peak is from a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, putting all this together, the most plausible option is C6H10O2 (option C). The IR shows O-H (from an alcohol or phenol), but since option C has two O's, which would fit an ester and an alcohol. But wait, that would require three O's. Hmm, no. Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a different functional group.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate). The formula for ethyl acrylate is C5H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2, which is six carbons. So perhaps the compound is a six-carbon alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

For example, methyl vinyl acetate: structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Formula is C4H6O2. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester of a six-carbon acid with a double bond. For example, CH2=CHCH2CH2COOCH3. That would be C6H10O2. So the formula fits option C.

In that case, the IR would show C=O from the ester at ~1700 cm-1 and possibly a conjugated C=C (from the alpha,beta-unsaturation) at 1650 cm-1. The O-H peak at 3000 might not fit because the compound is an ester, which doesn't have an O-H. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, but perhaps the O-H is from somewhere else. Maybe the compound is a diol ester or something else. But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is actually an alcohol group, and the compound is a diol with a ketone. But that would require more O's.

Wait, another angle: the mass fragment at 45 is the key. If the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and another part, and the 45 is OCH2CH3, then the compound must have an ethyl group attached via oxygen. So perhaps the ester is ethyl, and the rest is a four-carbon group with a carbonyl and a double bond.

So, if the compound is ethyl something-oate, where the something has a double bond and a carbonyl, that would fit.

For example, ethyl pent-2-enoate would be CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's compute the formula: C5H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2. So that's one carbon too short.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is ethyl and the other part is a four-carbon group with a double bond and a carbonyl. Let me think: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 is C5H8O2. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a six-carbon ester with an ethyl group and a double bond. Let's say ethyl cyclohex-2-enoate. The formula would be C8H12O2, which is more than six carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Given the data, the most plausible formula is C6H10O2 (option C), as it accounts for the two DoUs (C=O and C=C), the ester group (which explains the 1700 cm-1 peak), and the fragment at 45 (ethyl group). The O-H in IR might be from an alcohol, but perhaps the structure has both an ester and an alcohol group. But since the formula only allows for two O's, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a phenol group, but there's no data for aromatic protons.

Wait, another thought: maybe the O-H is from a hemiacetal or an acetal, but that's more about protecting groups and might not fit the IR data.

Alternatively, the broad peak at 3000 could be from an alkyne C-H stretch, but that's less likely. Or maybe it's an amide, but again, no data for that.

Given all this, I think the best fit is option C: C6H10O2. The ester group explains the 1700 cm-1 peak, the vinyl H in NMR suggests a double bond, and the fragment at 45 suggests an ethyl group. The O-H in IR might be a mistake or perhaps comes from another part of the molecule, but given the options, C seems the best fit.


The question involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. Here's the analysis:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm$^{-1}$ suggests the presence of an O-H group (likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
   - Strong peaks at 1700 cm$^{-1}$ and 1650 cm$^{-1}$ indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system (e.g., C=C or C=O with conjugation).

2. **$^1$H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (C=C) are observed, indicating the presence of a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is observed. This is consistent with a fragment containing an ethyl group (C$_2$H$_5$), as the molecular weight of an ethoxy group (OCH$_2$CH$_3$) is 45.

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**:
   - The compound must have at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the carbonyl group and one for the double bond).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A: C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$**
  - Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (from the formula). This is insufficient to account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond.  
  - **Eliminated**.

- **Option B: C$_6$H$_{10}$O**
  - Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This accounts for the carbonyl and double bond. However, the IR data shows a broad O-H peak, which suggests the presence of an alcohol or carboxylic acid. This would require two oxygen atoms, but the formula only has one.  
  - **Eliminated**.

- **Option C: C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**
  - Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This accounts for the carbonyl and double bond.  
  - The IR data can be explained by an ester group (C=O at 1700 cm$^{-1}$) and possibly a conjugated system (C=C at 1650 cm$^{-1}$).  
  - The broad O-H peak at 3000 cm$^{-1}$ could arise from an alcohol or phenol group.  
  - The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of an ethyl group, which is consistent with the ester functional group.  
  - **Best fit**.

- **Option D: C$_6$H$_{12}$O**
  - Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This is insufficient to account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond.  
  - **Eliminated**.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$** (Option C). This formula accounts for the observed spectroscopic data, including the functional groups, degrees of unsaturation, and the mass spectrometry fragment.

**Answer: C**
