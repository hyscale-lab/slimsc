Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, does that mean they're spread out evenly in all directions, or that their density is uniform? I think it means that the density is uniform, so the same number of stars per unit volume everywhere. But how does that translate to the number of stars we observe with a certain parallax?

Parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance (in some units, maybe parsecs). So higher parallax means closer stars, and lower parallax means farther away.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So like, if I pick a thin slice in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that slice compared to others?

The options are all about the dependence on 1/plx raised to some power. So like, 1/plx or 1/plx squared, etc.

I think I need to relate the number of stars in a given parallax range to the volume of space that corresponds to that range.

Wait, since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume should be proportional to the volume. So the number in a region is density * volume. Since density is uniform, the number depends on the volume.

But how does the volume relate to parallax? Parallax is 1/distance, so distance d = 1/plx.

Let me think in terms of a spherical shell. For a given distance d, the volume of a thin shell (like a sphere with thickness dd) would be the surface area of the sphere times the thickness. Surface area of a sphere is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that. Then d² is (1/plx)^2, and dd is the change in d. But if plx is the variable, then dd = -d * dplx, since d = 1/plx. So plx increase means d decreases.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms
