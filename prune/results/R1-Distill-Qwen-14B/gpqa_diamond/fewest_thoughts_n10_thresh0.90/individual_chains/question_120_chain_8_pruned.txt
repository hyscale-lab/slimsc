Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let me think about what I know.

Alright, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, but stars are three-dimensional objects, so their distribution in the sky probably relates to how they're spread out in space. Oh right, the concept of parallax comes into play here. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star relative to more distant stars as observed from Earth during its orbit. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, plx = 1/distance, approximately. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away. 

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So essentially, what's the density of stars in terms of parallax intervals?

Hmm, I think I remember something about this in relation to distance modulus or maybe how the number of stars is distributed in space. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's say n is the number density, which is a constant.

Wait, but volume depends on distance. So if you consider a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But since parallax is related to distance, plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Let me think about substituting that in.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume is n, so the number in a small volume dV is n dV. But we're interested in the number per unit parallax. So maybe I should express everything in terms of plx, not distance.

So let's let plx = p. Then d = 1/p. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πd² dr. But we need to express this in terms of p. Since dr is the change in distance, how does that relate to dp?

We can take derivatives. Since p = 1/d, then dp/dd = -1/d². So dr = -d² dp. Because, let's see, if p decreases (because d increases), then dp is negative. So the change in r (dr) is d² times the change in p (dp), but with a negative sign. But since we're dealing with volumes and counts, the negative sign just represents direction, which doesn't matter for the magnitude here. So we can take the absolute value, making dr = (d²) dp.

Substituting d = 1/p, dr becomes ( (1/p)^2 ) dp. So dr = (1/p²) dp.

Previously, the number of stars in a shell was n * 4π d² dr. Substituting d=1/p and dr=1/p² dp, we have:

Number of stars = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

Wait no, wait. Because the volume element is 4πd² dr. Let me re-express that.

dV = 4πd² dr.

But dr in terms of dp is (1/p²) dp. So dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

Wait, that's 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp? No, wait, 4πd² dr: d is 1/p, so d squared is (1/p)^2. dr is (1/p²) dp. So:

dV = 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax between p and p+dp is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, we're asked about the number per unit range of parallax. So that's the number
