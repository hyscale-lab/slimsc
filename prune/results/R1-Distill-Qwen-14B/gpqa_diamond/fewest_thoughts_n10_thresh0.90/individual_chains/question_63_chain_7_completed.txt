--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, I remember from my studies that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model. The question is about finding the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state. The molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, which I think means it can rotate and vibrate. But the problem is asking about the momentum of the photon needed for this transition.

I think I need to find the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state, and then relate that to the photon's energy, since the photon's energy is what's causing the transition. But wait, photons also carry momentum, so once I find the energy, I can find the momentum using E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light.

Wait, but is that right? Because E for a photon is indeed E = pc, so yes, once I have the energy change, I can get p by dividing by c.

So first, let me figure out which energy states are involved. The fundamental state is the lowest energy. For a diatomic molecule modeled with rotation and vibration, I think the energy levels are quantized. The vibration part is like a quantum harmonic oscillator, and rotation is like a quantized rotor.

Wait, the question says it's using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, wait, non-rigid rotor is different from the rigid rotor. Oh right, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so it's more like a vibration coupled with rotation.

Wait, but the problem says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, which could be a bit more complex. Or perhaps they're treating each mode (vibration and rotation) separately but considering their coupling.

Wait, but the question is about the transition when the molecule is in the fundamental state. So the molecule is initially in the lowest energy state, and absorbs a photon to go to the next lowest state.

Wait, what's the next state after the fundamental? If the fundamental is the lowest, the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a combination where both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers increase.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (ν + 1/2) h w, where ν is the vibrational quantum number.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state because the bond length isn't fixed. So the rotational levels are split into different vibrational states. But the problem says to model it as a non-rigid rotor, so perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both.

But the problem is about the transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is in the fundamental state, which would be the lowest vibrational state (ν=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational quantum number starts at J=0, but when J=0, the molecule is spherically symmetric, but for a diatomic, J can't be zero because it's linear. Wait, maybe J starts at 1? No, I think J can be zero for a diatomic? Or perhaps not. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, I think for a diatomic, the rotational quantum number J can take values J = 0, 1, 2, ... but J=0 is allowed. But sometimes, in certain contexts, J starts at 1 because of the symmetry, but I'm not certain. Maybe it's better to proceed assuming J starts at 0.

So the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (ν=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). Then the next state could be either ν=0 and J=1, or ν=1 and J=0. Which one would have a lower energy?

Hmm, that's the key. Because the photon must have the energy difference corresponding to the transition to the next possible state with the lowest energy.

So I need to compute the energies for both possibilities and see which one is lower.

Wait, but also, the energy for the combined rotation-vibration model. Let me think: the total energy E is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies. So E_total = E_rot + E_vib.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational constant B depends on the vibrational state because the bond length isn't fixed. So B depends on the vibrational state. So E_rot for a given J depends on ν.

Alternatively, perhaps the model treats the vibrational and rotational energies as separate. Wait, the problem gives the angular frequency for vibration, which is w. So the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (ν + 1/2) ħ w.

The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ r², μ is the reduced mass, r is bond length.

But wait, the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both. So when the molecule is in a vibration state, the rotational energy levels are affected because the bond length changes.

But maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can treat each mode (vibration and rotation) separately, so the total energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. So E_total = E_vib + E_rot.

In that case, the fundamental state is ν=0, J=0. The next possible states would be either ν=1, J=0 or ν=0, J=1. So which of these would have a lower energy?

We need to compute both possibilities.

First, let's find the energy of each possibility.

Compute E_vib for ν=0 and ν=1.

E_vib for ν=0 is (0 + 1/2) ħ w = (1/2) ħ w.

For ν=1, E_vib is (1 + 1/2) ħ w = (3/2) ħ w.

Now, for E_rot, when J=0, E_rot = 0. When J=1, E_rot = B * 1*(1+1) = 2 B.

So the total energy for ν=0, J=0 is (1/2) ħ w.

For ν=1, J=0: (3/2) ħ w.

For ν=0, J=1: E_total = (1/2) ħ w + 2 B.

So which is lower? The next state is either ν=1, J=0 or ν=0, J=1.

We need to compare (3/2) ħ w versus (1/2) ħ w + 2 B.

So let's compute the difference between these two.

Δ1 = (3/2 ħ w) - (1/2 ħ w) )= ħ w.

Δ2 = [(1/2) ħ w + 2 B ] - [(1/2) ħ w] = 2 B.

So the lower energy next state is whichever Δ is smaller. Wait, no, wait. We're looking for the transition from the fundamental state (ν=0, J=0) to the next lowest state, which would be whichever of the two possibilities has the smaller energy.

So which is lower between (3/2 ħ w) and (1/2 ħ w + 2 B)?

If 3/2 ħ w < (1/2 ħ w + 2 B), then the next state is ν=1, J=0.

Else, the next state is ν=0, J=1.

So we need to find whether 3/2 ħ w is less than (1/2 ħ w + 2 B), which simplifies to checking if ħ w < 2 B. Because 3/2 ħ w < 1/2 ħ w + 2 B → 3/2 ħ w - 1/2 ħ w < 2 B → ħ w < 2 B.

So if ħ w < 2 B, then the next state is ν=1, J=0. Otherwise, it's ν=0, J=1.

So we need to compute B and see which condition holds.

B is the rotational constant, given by ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia.

I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass.

Given:
Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
Bond length (r) = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.
Angular frequency (w) = 4e14 rad/s.

Compute μ: the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 * 2)/(20 +2 ) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but to compute I, we need to convert μ from amu to kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's compute that:

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's see: 1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988, but more accurately:

1.818 * 1.6605 = (1.8 * 1.6605) + (0.018 *1.6605)
= (2.9889) + (0.029889) ≈ 3.0188. So approximately 3.0188e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 = ?

Let me compute 1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889.

0.018 *1.6605 = 0.029889.

So total is 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.0188.

So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Now, r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2 I).

We know that ħ (h-bar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2075e-46) )

Compute denominator: 2 *1.2075e-46= 2.415e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 ≈ (1.112 /2.415) ) * 1e-22.

1.112 /2.415 ≈ 0.46.

So B ≈ 0.46e-22 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, but let me be precise with the calculation.

Compute 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = (1.112/2.415) * 1e(-68 +46) )= 0.4606 *1e-22 = 4.606e-23 J.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check the exponents.

Wait, 1e-68 divided by 1e-46 is 1e-22, yes.

So B ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

Now, let's compute ħ w and 2 B.

ħ w: ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħ w = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

2 B = 2 *4.606e-23 =9.212e-23 J.

Now compare ħ w and 2 B.

4.218e-20 J vs. 9.212e-23 J.

Clearly, 4.218e-20 is much larger than 9.212e-23. So 4.218e-20 > 9.212e-23.

So the condition ħ w < 2 B is not true; instead, ħ w is much larger.

So 3/2 ħ w (which is 6.327e-20 J) is larger than (1/2 ħ w + 2 B) which is (2.109e-20 +9.212e-23) ≈ 2.1099e-20 J.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute (1/2 ħ w + 2 B):

(1/2) ħ w = 2.109e-20 J.

2 B =9.212e-23 J.

Adding them gives 2.109e-20 + 9.212e-23 ≈ 2.1099e-20 J.

So comparing 3/2 ħ w = 6.327e-20 J and 2.1099e-20 J.

Wait, no. Wait, the next state's energy would be either:

Option 1: ν=1, J=0 → E = (3/2) ħ w ≈ 6.327e-20 J.

Option 2: ν=0, J=1 → E = (1/2) ħ w + 2 B ≈ 2.109e-20 J.

So the next state with the lowest energy is Option 2, because 2.1e-20 < 6.3e-20.

Wait, that's way lower, so the molecule would transition to ν=0, J=1.

So the energy difference ΔE is the transition from the fundamental state (ν=0, J=0) to the next state (ν=0, J=1).

Wait, no. Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest possible energy. So for a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (ν=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state is the next lowest, which is either ν=1, J=0 or ν=0, J=1.

But in this case, we found that the energy for ν=0, J=1 is lower than ν=1, J=0. So the molecule would transition to ν=0, J=1 when absorbing a photon of energy ΔE = (1/2 ħ w + 2 B) - (1/2 ħ w ) = 2 B.

So ΔE = 2 * 4.606e-23 J = 9.212e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, no. The fundamental state is (ν=0, J=0), so E_fundamental = (1/2 ħ w) + 0 (since J=0) = 0.5 ħ w.

The next state is (ν=0, J=1), which has energy E = 0.5 ħ w + 2 B.

So the energy difference is (0.5 ħ w + 2 B) - (0.5 ħ w) )= 2 B.

So the photon's energy must be 2 B.

So E_photon = 2 B.

Then, the momentum p of the photon is E/c, since E=pc → p = E/(c).

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 2 B / c.

We have B =4.606e-23 J.

So 2 B = 9.212e-23 J.

p = 9.212e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s? Wait, that can't be right because the options are much larger.

Wait, wait a second. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me go back.

Wait, I think I messed up the exponents somewhere. Let me recalculate B.

I think I did a miscalculation earlier.

Let me recompute B.

B = ħ²/(2I).

I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) ) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.81818 amu *1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's compute 1.81818 *1.6605.

1.81818 *1.6605:

1 *1.6605 =1.6605

0.8 *1.6605 = 1.3284

0.01818 *1.6605 ≈ approx 0.029.

So total is approximately 1.6605 +1.3284 = 2.9889 +0.029= 3.0179.

So μ ≈ 3.0179e-27 kg.

r is 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² =3.0179e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0179e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20716e-46 kg m².

Now, B = ħ²/(2 I).

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68.

1.0545718^2 ≈ 1.112.

So ħ²≈1.112e-68.

Then, 2I = 2 *1.20716e-46 =2.4143e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4143e-46 ≈ (1.112/2.4143) ) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.4143 ≈ approximately 0.46.

So B ≈ 0.46e-22 J.

Wait, because 1e-68 divided by 1e-46 is 1e-22.

So B = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, same as before. So 2 B is 9.2e-23 J.

So the energy of the photon is E_photon =2 B = 9.212e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.212e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

J is kg·m²/s², so J/(m/s) ) is kg·m/s, which is the unit of momentum.

So 9.212e-23 /3e8 = (9.212 /3 ) * 1e-31.

9.212 /3 ≈ 3.07.

So p ≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1.4e-28 kg·m/s.

Hmm, my calculation gives 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest option.

That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the energy difference. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered both rotational and vibrational transitions. Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are not just the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. Because the bond length is not fixed, the vibrational state affects the rotational constant.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are more complex. Because when the bond length changes (due to vibration), the moment of inertia I changes, which affects the rotational energy.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. So the energy levels are coupled between rotation and vibration. This makes it more complex because the total energy isn't just E_rot + E_vib.

In such a case, the energy levels are treated as a combination, and the selection rules are different. But I'm not sure about the exact form.

Wait, but the problem says that the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps it's a rigid rotor coupled with a harmonic oscillator, and the total energy is the sum of the two.

But earlier, I thought that the next state is ν=0, J=1, but the calculation of the energy there is much smaller than the ν=1, J=0 state.

Wait, but in the problem, the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is ν=0 and J=0.

The next state would have the next highest energy. So if the energy for ν=0, J=1 is lower than ν=1, J=0, then that's the next state.

Wait, but when I calculated, the energy for ν=0, J=1 is about 2.1e-20 J, and for ν=1, J=0 it's about 6.3e-20 J. So the next state is ν=0, J=1, which has lower energy than ν=1, J=0.

So it makes sense that the transition is to ν=0, J=1. So the photon's energy must be the difference between E(ν=0, J=1) and E(ν=0, J=0).

Which is ( (1/2) ħ w + 2 B ) - ( (1/2) ħ w ) ) = 2 B.

So E_photon = 2 B =9.212e-23 J.

So p = E_photon / c =9.212e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, let me recalculate μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) )= (20 *2) / (22 )=40/22= 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Ah, wait, but amu is atomic mass units. But when calculating the moment of inertia, do I need to compute the reduced mass correctly?

Wait, to compute the moment of inertia, I must use the reduced mass in kilograms.

Yes, as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of I.

I = μ r².

μ=1.81818 amu =1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.017e-27 kg.

r=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

r²=4e-20 m².

I=3.017e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Now, B= ħ²/(2I )= (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 *1.2068e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34 )^2 = approximately (1.0545718)^2 *1e-68 = 1.112e-68.

Denominator:2 *1.2068e-46=2.4136e-46.

So B=1.112e-68 /2.4136e-46 → divide 1.112 by2.4136.

1.112 /2.4136 ≈0.46.

So B=0.46e-22 J =4.6e-23 J.

Which is what I had before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the next state is ν=0, J=1. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the next state is a combination of both, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the fundamental vibrational state and the fundamental rotational state. Wait, the fundamental state is the first excited state, perhaps.

Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So ν=0, J=0 is the ground state.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Wait, the question says, "the molecule is in its fundamental state."

In molecular spectroscopy, the fundamental vibrational state is ν=0, and the ground rotational state is J=0.

But sometimes, the ground state is considered as J=0, but for a diatomic, J can be 0, but the lowest state is J=0 for rotational as well.

Wait, but perhaps for a diatomic molecule, J can't be 0. Or wait, J can be zero. Actually, for a linear rotor, J can be zero. Wait, no, no, for a linear molecule, the rotational quantum number J can be zero. Because the wavefunction for J=0 is spherically symmetric, which is possible for a diatomic.

So the fundamental state is ν=0, J=0.

So the next state is either ν=1, J=0 or ν=0, J=1.

But in our calculation, the energy for ν=0, J=1 is 2.1e-20 J, and for ν=1, J=0 is 6.3e-20 J.

So the next state is ν=0, J=1, because it has lower energy.

So the photon's energy is 2 B =9.2e-23 J.

But the options are way larger. So I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy difference between the fundamental state and the first overtone. Or perhaps the transition considers both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (ν=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be ν=1, J=0 or ν=0, J=1, whichever is lower.

Wait, but earlier I found that ν=0, J=1 is lower than ν=1, J=0, so the photon's energy is 2 B.

But that gives a momentum that's way too low, which doesn't match any of the options.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: perhaps the question is about the transition to the next vibrational state, and the rotational part is ignored.

But then the energy difference would be the vibrational quantum.

Wait, but the problem states it's using the rotation-vibration model, so they probably expect both to be considered.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the transition to the next state in terms of the combined rotational and vibrational states, which would require considering the energy levels together.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the first excited state beyond the fundamental state, which is a combination of rotation and vibration.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energy levels in the rotation-vibration model.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule is treated as a three-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, but that's not the case for a diatomic.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is that the energy levels are quantized as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator, and the total energy is E = B J (J+1) + (ν + 1/2) h w.

So in this case, the fundamental state is ν=0, J=0.

The next state could be either ν=1, J=0 or ν=0, J=1.

But in this case, the energy for ν=1, J=0 is (3/2 h w) and for ν=0, J=1 is (2 B) + (1/2 h w).

So the transition to whichever is lower.

If (3/2 h w) < (2 B + 1/2 h w ), then the next state is ν=1, J=0.

Else, it's ν=0, J=1.

So let me compute (3/2 h w) and (2 B +1/2 h w).

Compute 3/2 h w and 2 B + 1/2 h w.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

So 3/2 h w =3.9756e-19 J.

2 B, as before, is 9.212e-23 J.

So 2 B + 1/2 h w =9.212e-23 + 1.3252e-19 = approx 1.3252e-19 J.

So 3.9756e-19 J (ν=1, J=0) is higher than 1.3252e-19 J (ν=0, J=1).

So the next state is ν=0, J=1. So the energy difference is 2 B =9.212e-23 J.

Which gives the photon's momentum as 9.212e-23 / (3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are all about 1e-27 to 2e-27.

So that suggests that there's a mistake in my approach.

Alternative idea: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (J=0, ν=0) to the first excited state, which is J=1, ν=0, but perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B correctly.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ r².

But perhaps I made a mistake in the bond length.

The bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

Wait, correct.

So I=μ r²=3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.017e-27*(4e-20) =1.207e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2 I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.207e-46 )= (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46 ) = approx 4.6e-23 J.

So that part seems correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the rotational energy as B J (J+1) multiplied by something else.

Wait, the rotational energy E_rot is given by E_rot = B J (J +1), where B is in cm^-1 or some other units. Or perhaps B is expressed in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers and then convert to energy.

Wait, the rotational constant B is often expressed in cm^-1 and is given by B = h c / (4 π² c I), but I get confused.

Alternatively, perhaps B is ħ²/(2 I), which is what I used.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of the angular frequency of the rotational mode, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1) )/( 2 I ), which is what I used.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the problem expects me to compute the change in vibrational energy instead.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which includes both rotation and vibration. So the photon must supply energy to increase either the vibrational or rotational state.

But if the next state is the rotational state, as I found, then the energy is 2 B, but the options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the transition to the first vibrational state, which is ν=1, J=0.

But then the energy would be E = (3/2) ħ w.

So E_photon = (3/2) ħ w.

Which would be 1.5 * ħ w.

Compute that:

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

So ħ = h/(2 pi) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ w =1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

(3/2) ħ w =6.327e-20 J.

So p = E/c =6.327e-20 /3e8 =2.109e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is about 2.1e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28.

Hmm, not matching exactly.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

Compute (3/2) ħ w:

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

(3/2)(1.0545718e-34 *4e14) = (3/2)(4.218287e-20 )=6.32743e-20 J.

p =6.32743e-20 / (3e8 ) =2.10914e-28 kg·m/s → 2.109e-28 N·s.

The option closest is A) 1.9e-28.

But that's not very close. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition, ignoring rotation.

But the question mentions the rotation-vibration model, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the next state.

Wait, perhaps the next state is a combination of ν=1 and J=1.

But that would have higher energy than both ν=1, J=0 and ν=0, J=1, so it wouldn't be the next state.

Another possibility is that I made an error in thinking that the next state is ν=0, J=1. Maybe in some models, the next state is a combination of rotation and vibration. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the molecule as a 3D rigid rotor, but that's not the case here since it's diatomic.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the Raman transition, where the photon induces a change in the rotational state, but that's more relevant in Raman spectroscopy and might not apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy difference between the fundamental state and the first excited vibrational state, ignoring rotation.

In that case, E_photon = ħ w (from ν=0 to ν=1).

Which would be E_photon = ħ w =4.218e-20 J.

p =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is about 1.4e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28.

That's an option. But earlier I thought that in the rotation-vibration model, the next state would be ν=0, J=1, which requires a lower-energy photon. But if the problem is considering only the vibrational transition, then the photon's momentum would be about 1.4e-28, which matches option D.

But the problem statement says that the model is rotation-vibration, so I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational transition, and the rotational part is ignored. But the question says it's using the rotation-vibration model, so perhaps that's not correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the energy of the photon as the sum of both rotational and vibrational changes.

But I'm getting stuck here because my calculations don't match any of the options when considering rotation, but they do when considering only vibration.

Wait, perhaps the question is only about the vibrational state. Let me read the question again.

Question: "the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?"

The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. The next state would be the one with the next lowest energy. So if the next state is a higher rotational state (J=1, ν=0), then the photon's energy is 2 B.

But in my calculation, that gives a momentum of about 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is way below the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational state, and only the vibrational state is being addressed.

In that case, the photon's energy is (3/2) ħ w, but that gives p= 6.327e-20 J /3e8 m/s → 2.1e-28 kg·m/s. Which is near option A (1.9e-28).

Alternatively, perhaps the fundamental state is considered as the first rotational state. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state (ν=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (ν=1, J=0), which requires a photon of energy E = (3/2 ħ w) - (1/2 ħ w) )= ħ w.

Wait, in that case, E_photon = ħ w =4.218e-20 J.

p =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg·m/s → 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which matches option D: 1.4e-28.

But earlier, when considering the rotational part, the energy difference is much smaller, but that's not matching any options.

So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore rotational transitions and consider only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, where the bond length changes, affecting the vibrational energy.

Wait, but I think the confusion here is that I'm not considering the correct energy levels in the rotation-vibration model.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the vibration and rotation are coupled, and the energy levels are given by a combination of both. The total energy is given by:

E = ħ ω ν + [ ħ² / (2 μ r^2) ] J (J+1) (1 + ν κ )

where κ is the anharmonicity constant. But I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, the energy levels might be modeled as E = ħ ω (ν + 1/2) + B J (J+1) (1 + ν δ ), where δ is some factor due to bond length change.

In this case, the energy of the fundamental state is E0 = ħ ω/2 + B (0)(1) (1) )= ħ ω/2.

The next state could be either ν=1, J=0 or ν=0, J=1.

But in this model, B might depend on ν. For example, when ν increases, the bond length increases, so I increases, so B decreases.

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length r is not fixed, so the moment of inertia I depends on the vibrational state. So B = ħ²/(2 I), and I depends on ν.

So for a given ν, B_ν = ħ²/(2 μ <r²> ), where <r²> is the average bond length squared for that vibrational state.

Assuming the bond length increases with ν, so B_ν decreases as ν increases.

But without knowing the exact dependence, it's difficult to compute.

But perhaps the problem is assuming that the bond length is fixed, and so the rotational constant is fixed, making it a rigid rotor. But the problem states it's a non-rigid rotor, so that might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to compute the vibrational transition, assuming that the rotational state doesn't change, so the photon's energy is ħ w.

In that case, p= ħ w /c.

So with ħ w =4.218e-20 J, p =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 N·s, which matches option D.

But earlier, considering the rotational transition, the calculation doesn't match any options.

So perhaps the intended answer is option A, which is 1.9e-28.

Wait, but why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, let me compute B again.

I = μ r².

μ = (Mx My)/(Mx + My) )= (20*2)/(22) )=40/22=1.81818 amu.

1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ=1.81818 *1.6605e-27 = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I=3.018e-27 * (2e-10 )^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

Then, B= ħ²/(2I)= (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2*1.207e-46 )= (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46 )= approx 4.6e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 B=9.2e-23 J.

Which is way smaller than the vibrational energy.

So the photon's momentum would be much smaller than the options provided.

Thus, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the rotational part and only consider the vibrational transition.

In that case, the photon's energy is ħ w.

Which gives p= ħ w /c = (1.05457e-34 *4e14) /3e8 = (4.218e-20)/3e8 =≈1.406e-28 N·s.

Which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy levels in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (ν = 0) and the lowest rotational state (J = 0). The next state could either be ν = 1, J = 0 or ν = 0, J = 1. The energy of each state is calculated as:

1. **Vibrational Energy**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \left(\nu + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
   \]  
   For ν = 0:  
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega
   \]  
   For ν = 1:  
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega
   \]

2. **Rotational Energy**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J + 1)
   \]  
   where \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \) is the rotational constant, and \( I = \mu r^2 \) is the moment of inertia.  
   - Reduced mass:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]  
     Converting to kilograms:  
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]  
   - Bond length:  
     \[
     r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
     \]  
     Moment of inertia:  
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]  
     Rotational constant:  
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]

3. **Energy of States**:  
   - For ν = 0, J = 0:  
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega + 0 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega
     \]  
   - For ν = 1, J = 0:  
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega + 0 = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega
     \]  
   - For ν = 0, J = 1:  
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = E_{\text{vib}} + E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega + 2B
     \]

4. **Comparison of States**:  
   The energy difference for ν = 1, J = 0 is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega - \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega = \hbar \omega
   \]  
   The energy difference for ν = 0, J = 1 is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \left(\frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega + 2B\right) - \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega = 2B
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   - \(\hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\)  
   - \(2B = 2 \cdot 4.6 \times 10^{-23} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)  

   Since \(2B \ll \hbar \omega\), the next state with the lowest energy is ν = 0, J = 1. However, the energy difference for this transition is much smaller than the options provided, suggesting the problem may instead consider only the vibrational transition.

5. **Photon Momentum**:  
   If the transition is purely vibrational (ν = 0 → ν = 1), the photon energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{photon}} = \hbar \omega = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The momentum of the photon is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
   \]  
   This matches **Option D**.

Given the options and the calculations, the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem focuses on the vibrational transition, ignoring the rotational contribution. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
