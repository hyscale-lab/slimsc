Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what's going on.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They want to find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh right, the peak wavelength of black body radiation is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Wait, but wait. Because the star's radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh, right! So the observed wavelength is affected by the star's motion towards or away from us.

Wait, so the rest wavelength would be λ_rest, but the observed λ (λ_observed) depends on the radial velocity. The formula I think is something like λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, actually, I think it's λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ) if using relativistic Doppler shift, but for small velocities, the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c) is often used. But I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, since the problem says that the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So for each star, the peak emission is at the same observed wavelength, but perhaps their rest wavelengths are different because their velocities are different.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths they appear brightest are the same. So when you observe Star_1 and Star_2, they both emit most strongly at the same λ. But their actual (rest) temperatures might differ because their velocities are different. So how does that work?

Wait, let me think: Each star emits a spectrum with a peak at λ_rest based on their temperature. But due to their radial velocity, the observed peak would shift. So for Star_1, which has radial velocity 0, its observed peak is at λ1_obs = λ1_rest. For Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s, its observed peak is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r/c), assuming v_r is positive when moving away (so redshifted). Wait, but if the observed peaks are the same, then λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So the rest wavelengths are λ1_rest and λ2_rest. But because Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer (redshifted). And Star_1's observed λ is the same as Star_2's, which is λ_obs = λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, but in the problem, it says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So λ1_obs equals λ2_obs, which is λ_obs.

So, let me write this down:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since Star_1 has v_r=0)
λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c)

And we have λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ_rest is related to temperature via Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T. So, λ1_rest = b / T1 and λ2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting back:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

The b's cancel out. So:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Rearranging:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me check the algebra. Suppose I have:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + delta )

So, solving for T2: T2 = T1 * (1/(1 + delta)) )

Wait, no, let's see:

From 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2/(T1) = 1 + v_r2/c

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive, so T2 is higher than T1. Because if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted) implies that the rest wavelength is shorter. Since λ_rest = b/T, if λ_rest is shorter, T must be higher. So yes, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c)

Wait, but wait, I thought that when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the rest wavelength is shorter, so the temperature is higher. So T2 is higher than T1.

But in the problem, Star_1 has higher mass and radius. But I'm not sure how mass comes into play here. Oh, the problem mentions that the mass is 1.5 times larger, but the question is about luminosity. But luminosity formula only depends on radius and temperature, not mass. So maybe mass is a distractor here, or perhaps it's used elsewhere.

Let me get back to the problem. So I think the key is:

Luminosity L is proportional to R² T⁴.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

We need to find L1/L2.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

Substituting R1 = 1.5 R2:

= ( (1.5 R2 )^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

The R2² cancels out:

= 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

So we need T1 and T2. From earlier, we have T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, because from earlier:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. From the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), assuming v_r is positive when moving away.

So for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, and Star_1's λ1_rest is λ1 = b / T1, and Star_2's λ2_rest is b / T2.

So b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Divide both sides by b, we get 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2 T1:

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but this would mean T2 is higher than T1, right? Because v_r2 is positive (700 km/s), so (1 + v_r2/c ) is greater than 1.

But wait, if T2 is higher than T1, then in the luminosity ratio, T1^4 / T2^4 would be smaller than 1, making L1/L2 smaller than 2.25.

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers. Let's compute T2 in terms of T1.

v_r2 = 700 km/s. Let's compute v_r2 / c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.002333...

So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.0
