Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the formulas, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key data points are:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.
- Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times larger than Star_2's.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same.
- The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.
- Both stars are considered as black bodies.
- We need to find by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but the question mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same. Because T is inversely proportional to λ_max.

If that's the case, then T1 = T2. So their temperatures are equal. So when calculating their luminosities, the T part will be the same, so L is proportional to R².

Wait, but wait another moment. Because the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so maybe that's a Doppler shift? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength changes. Oh wait, the question says they used spectroscopy to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But that doesn't necessarily mean their actual temperatures are the same. Because if one is moving towards us and the other is moving away, the observed λ_max could be the same even if their actual temperatures are different.

Wait, no. Let me think. Let's say Star_1 has a velocity v1 and Star_2 has v2. The observed wavelength would be affected by the Doppler shift. The formula for Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), but I might be mixing up relativistic and non-relativistic formulas. Alternatively, for small velocities compared to the speed of light, the Doppler shift can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), but I'm not totally sure about the sign conventions.

Wait, but in this problem, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so v_r1 = 0. Star_2 has v_r2 = 700 km/s. So for Star_2, the observed wavelength would be different from its emitted wavelength due to the Doppler effect.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, λ1_obs = λ2_obs. But λ1_obs is the emission from Star_1, and since v_r1 is 0, λ1_obs = λ1_actual (emitted). For Star_2, λ2_obs is the emitted wavelength multiplied by some Doppler factor because Star_2 is moving with velocity v_r2 = 700 km/s.

So, let me model this. Let me denote the actual (rest) temperature of each star as T1 and T2. The peak wavelengths they emit are λ1 and λ2, given by Wien's law: λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

But due to the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength for Star_2 (λ2_obs) is different. Since Star_2 is moving away (because v_r is positive 700 km/s), the observed wavelength would be longer than the emitted wavelength (redshift). So λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v_r2 / c). Wait, but v_r is positive when moving away. So the formula for redshift is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. For non-relativistic speeds, z ≈ v_r / c.

So, for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v_r is zero). For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c).

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same: λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)

But λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2. So substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c ) / T2

Rearranging,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the direction of the velocity. If Star_2 is moving away (v_r = +700 km/s), then the observed wavelength is longer. So the observed λ2_obs is longer than λ2_rest. So when we say Star_1's λ1_obs equals Star_2's λ2_obs, that would imply that Star_1's emitted λ1 is such that it equals Star_2's emitted λ2 multiplied by (1 + v_r2/c). So perhaps the correct equation is λ1 = λ2_obs/(1 + v_r2/c) )?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to model it properly.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c). So for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c).

Star_1's λ1_obs is equal to its own emitted λ1_rest, because its radial velocity is zero.

The problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ1_rest is the peak emission wavelength of Star_1, and λ2_rest is that of Star_2.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But from Wien's law, λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Since v_r2 is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So v_r2 / c ≈ 7e5 / 3e8 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.002333.

So,

1 + v_r2 / c ≈ 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

Thus,

T1 ≈ T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002327)  [Using approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x for small x]

So T1 is slightly less than T2. But wait, that can't be right? Because if the observed wavelengths are the same, but Star_2 is moving away, wouldn't its emitted wavelength be shorter, but due to the Doppler shift,
