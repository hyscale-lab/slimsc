Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the chemical formula of an unknown compound using the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around this region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, the compound probably has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, there are also strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak that usually corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or something like that. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or conjugated carbonyl? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine group, but I don't think that's the case here since the options don't include nitrogen.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, right? So the compound has a double bond, maybe part of an alkene or perhaps an aromatic ring. Since it's vinyl, probably a simple double bond, like in an alkene. If it's an aromatic ring, the protons would typically show up in a different region, maybe around 6.5-8 ppm, but the question just says 'vinyl' so I'll go with an alkene for now.

Moving on to the mass spectrometry: There's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I need to think about what fragments give this mass. 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2O (which is 45 g/mol) or maybe something else. Wait, another possibility is the methyl ester group, like in an ester. Because, for example, an ester group might lose some parts during fragmentation. Alternatively, 45 could be the mass of a CH2CH2O group or maybe a smaller fragment like an ethyl group attached to oxygen.

Now, considering the possible formulas given: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. Let's think about each.

The options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, looking at the molecular formulas, the degrees of unsaturation might help. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2. 

Let me calculate DoU for each:

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12. So (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU. That could mean one ring and one double bond, or two rings, etc. But wait, I'm not sure about the oxygens affecting DoU. Oxygens don't contribute to DoU as they're part of the molecule.

Option B: C6H10O. So (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. Two DoU. Could be two rings, or a ring and a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2 DoU.

Option D: C6H12O. (2*6+2-12)/2=(14-12)/2=1 DoU.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is likely, which is one DoU. If the FTIR has a carbonyl, that's another DoU. So total of 2 DoU needed, perhaps. Let's see which options have 2 DoU.

Looking back: Options B and C have two DoU. So the correct answer is either B, C, or perhaps A or D if I made a mistake in DoU.

Wait, maybe the IR data indicates two carbonyl groups? Because there's a peak at 1700 and 1650. That would mean two C=O groups. So perhaps the compound is an ester or something with two carbonyls, like a ketone and an ester, or maybe a conjugated system.

Wait, another thought: 1700 is a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester. 1650 could be another carbonyl, but perhaps conjugated. Alternatively, it could be a carbonyl adjacent to something else, like in a conjugated ester or a cyclic structure.

Now, the presence of an -OH group (from the broad peak at 3000) and a carbonyl could suggest something like an ester. Because esters have both an -O- and a carbonyl. Wait, but an ester has one carbonyl. Hmm, but in the IR, there are two carbonyl peaks. That's confusing. Maybe one is a carbonyl and another is something else. Wait, another possibility: the 1650 peak isn't a carbonyl but maybe an aromatic ring
