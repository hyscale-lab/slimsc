Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Then, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of that operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and zero otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. So first, the state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I think I should normalize this state first because probabilities require the state to be normalized (i.e., the sum of the squares of the amplitudes equals 1).

Let me write down the components. The state |alpha> can be written as a vector in the basis of |up> and |down>. Let me represent |up> as (1, 0) and |down> as (0, 1). So, the state is:

|alpha> = (1+i) |up> + (2 - i)|down> = [1+i, 2 - i]^T.

Wait, but since it's proportional, I need to normalize. The normalization factor would be the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components.

So, the normalization factor N is 1/sqrt(|1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2).

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + bi|^2 = a² + b².

Then, |2 - i|^2: 2² + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So, the denominator inside the square root is 2 +5=7. So N = 1/sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

But wait, the given state is just proportional, so the actual state is this normalized version. So from this, I can find the probabilities of measuring up and down in the z-basis.

Wait, but the question is about measuring in the eigenstates of another operator. Oh, right, the operator with matrix elements Aij as defined.

Wait, what is this operator? Let me think. The matrix is zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So for a 2x2 matrix, it would look like:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

So that's the operator. Let me denote this operator as O.

The eigenstates of O are the eigenstates we're interested in. So the probabilities we need to compute are the probabilities of |alpha> being in each of the eigenstates of O. Then, the average value of O is <O> = <alpha| O |alpha>.

I think I need to find the eigenstates of O first. Alternatively, perhaps O is a spin operator in some other direction, like x or y. Because the standard Pauli matrices have similar structures.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Their eigenstates are superpositions of |up> and |down> but with particular phases.

Wait, the operator O has off-diagonal elements hbar/2. The Pauli matrices have off-diagonal elements ±1. Let me see: O = (hbar/2) * ( [[0,1],[1,0]] ) because the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

So O is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So O is proportional to sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the spin eigenstates in the x-direction. So |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Alternatively, the eigenstates of O will be the same as those of sigma_x, since O is a scalar multiple of sigma_x. So the eigenstates are the same, just scaled by the factor.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of O, which is the x-basis.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should compute the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of O, and then the square of the coefficients would give the probabilities.

So, let me denote the eigenstates of O as |+O> and |-O>, corresponding to eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively. Then, the probability of measuring +hbar/2 would be |<+O|alpha>|², and similarly for the other.

But to compute that, I need to know the components of |alpha> in the O eigenbasis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of O, which are the |+x> and |-x> states.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of O.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Normalize the given state |alpha>.
2. Find the eigenstates of the operator O.
3. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.
4. The probabilities are the square of the coefficients.
5. Compute the average value <O> = <alpha| O |alpha>.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, normalization is done. The normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Next, find the eigenstates of O. Since O is proportional to sigma_x, its eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's. So, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

But wait, wait, let me compute O's eigenstates to be precise.

The operator O has matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues are found by solving det(O - λ I) = 0.

The matrix becomes:

[[-λ, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, -λ]] = 0.

The determinant is λ² - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ = ± (hbar/2).

So, the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The corresponding eigenvectors are found by solving (O - λ I)|v> = 0.

For λ = hbar/2:

Equation: - (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T. Since we can normalize, it becomes |+O> = [1; 1]/sqrt(2).

For λ = -hbar/2:

Equation: (hbar/2) v1 - (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = -v2.

Eigenvector proportional to [1, -1]^T. Normalized, it's |-O> = [1; -1]/sqrt(2).

So, the eigenstates are |+O> = 1/sqrt(2) [1, 1]^T, and |-O> = 1/sqrt(2) [1, -1]^T.

So now, to express |alpha> in terms of |+O> and |-O>.

We can write |alpha> = c_+ |+O> + c_- |-O>.

Compute c_+ = < +O | alpha >, and c_- = < -O | alpha >.

Compute < +O | alpha >:

< +O | is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

|alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ].

The inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

Factor out 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)):

[ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(14) = [1 + i + 2 - i ] / sqrt(14) = (3) / sqrt(14).

So c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute c_- = < -O | alpha >.

< -O | is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

Inner product: (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

Factor 1/(sqrt(14)):

[ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(14) = (1 +i -2 +i) / sqrt(14) = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+ |^2 and |c_- |^2.

Compute |c_+ |^2:

(3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

|c_- |^2: | (-1 + 2i) |^2 /14.

Compute numerator: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14≈0.3571. Let me check: 9+5=14, so that adds up to 1. So probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices for probabilities are:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → which is close to my 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14 (≈0.3571). So 0.64 is 9/14, 0.36 is 5/14? Wait, 5/14 is about 0.357, which is about 0.357, so 0.36.

So probabilities are approx 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A's first part.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the inner product.

Wait, when I computed c_+, the components were (1+i) and (2-i). When adding, (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3. So yes, 3/sqrt(14).

But wait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) → 3 / sqrt(14). So correct.

Similarly, for c_-, (1+i) - (2 -i) → 1 +i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i). So yes, correct. So |c_+|² is (3)^2/(14) =9/14 ≈0.6428, and |c_- |² is (1^2 + 2^2)/14 →5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the first part of the answer is 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A's first two numbers.

Now, the average value of O is <O> = <alpha| O |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in the eigenstates of O, the expectation value is |c_+|^2 * (hbar/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-hbar/2).

Which is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [9hbar/28 -5hbar/28 ] = (4hbar)/28 = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So putting it together, the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is hbar/7. So the correct option is A, which says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Wait, let me check the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → yes, that matches.

So the answer should be option A.


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( O \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( O \) must be calculated. The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is proportional to \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize, calculate the normalization factor:
\[
N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 + 5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( O \)
The operator \( O \) has the matrix representation:
\[
O = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( O \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+O\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-O\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenbasis of \( O \)
To find the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) of \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenbasis of \( O \), compute the inner products:
\[
c_+ = \langle +O|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -O|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+O\rangle \) and \( |-O\rangle \) are:
\[
P(+O) = |c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-O) = |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( O \)
The average value of \( O \) is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = P(+O) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-O) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( O \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
