Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the more noticeable the shift, I think.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. So, the RV method detected each planet, and we have the wavelength shifts for each.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused 7. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods. So, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's?

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula, I think, is K = (V) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds) )) )^(1/3) )

But since both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like) and the stars have the same mass (solar), the masses are the same. So the formula simplifies because M_p and M_star are the same for both.

Wait, let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Hmm, maybe I should look for a more simplified version. I think there's a relation where K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but this might be when M_p is much smaller than M_star, which is the case here because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun. So M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, approximating, K ∝ (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but M_p is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same for both stars. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) )

Which implies that P ∝ 1 / K^(3)

So if planet #1's K is 5 and planet #2's K is7, then the ratio of periods is (K1 / K2)^3.

Wait, no, because since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/(K^(3)).

So P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3.

Wait, let me think again: K ∝ (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

So solving for P: P^(1/3) ∝ (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / K )

So P ∝ (M_p^3) / (M_star^2 K^3 )

But since M_p and M_star are the same for both, P ∝ 1 / K^3.

So, P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3.

Wait, because P is proportional to 1/K^3. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 would be smaller than P1.

Wait, let me plug numbers. K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So (5/7)^3 is (25/49) = approximately 0.51. So P2 is 0.51 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.51 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So if P2 is 0.51 * P1, then it's shorter by a factor of about 0.51. So the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.51, which is approximately 0.5, but looking at the options, the closest is option A, which is ~0.36, or D) ~0.85. Wait, but 0.51 is closer to 0.5, but none of the options are exactly that. Wait, maybe I did the ratio backward.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (21 m/s) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (P / (365 days)) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, maybe it's better to look for a relationship between K and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: The Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is proportional to the velocity. So K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet.

The formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2) )^(1/2) ) ) * ( (2 pi) / P ) )^(1/3)

Wait, this might not be the easiest way. Let me think in terms of the formula that relates K to the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: The RV method relies on the fact that the star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The velocity of the star (K) is related to the mass of the planet, the period, and the distance of the planet.

The formula for K is:

K = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) P ) )^(1/3) )

But again, since M_p << M_star and e is zero (circular orbit), this simplifies.

K = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) )^(1/3 )

But e is zero, so (1 - e²) is 1. So,

K = (2 pi G / (1 - e^2) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P )^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are constants for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 is inversely proportional to the cube roots of P1 and P2.

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Rearranging,

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, wait. Let me see:

Let me write K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)) ). Because, from the formula, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3).

So, K1 = (1/P1)^(1/3) * constant.

K2 = (1/P2)^(1/3) * same constant.

So take the ratio K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So to find P2/P1, we cube both sides:

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

So inserting the values: K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 is approximately 0.364. So planet #2's period is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period than planet #1's? Wait, no, because P2 is 0.36 times P1. So planet #2's period is shorter. The question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So the answer would be 0.36 times longer, which is option A, which is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I have the ratio correct. If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So it's not longer—it's shorter. The question is, how many times longer is #2's period than #1's? So if it's shorter, the ratio is less than 1. So 0.36 times as long as #1, so it's 0.36 times longer than #1.

Wait, but is the question asking for P2/P1 or P1/P2?

The question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's 36% the length of P1. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the ratio reversed. Let me think again.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Which is 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So yes, P2 is shorter.

So the answer is A) ~0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for planets with similar masses and around stars of the same mass. Mathematically, \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), or equivalently, \( P \propto K^{-3} \).

In this problem, Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)), while Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)). Since \( P \propto K^{-3} \), the ratio of the orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's orbital period is 36% as long as Planet #1's, or equivalently, it is 0.36 times longer than Planet #1's.

The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. Based on the calculation, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
