Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds, right, so I can't just use classical mechanics formulas. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula from special relativity. And for energy, I think I'll need to calculate the relativistic energy for each astronaut and add them up.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Wait, so their rest masses are 2m and 3m respectively. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to find the relative speed between them. Wait, but they are moving in the same direction, so I guess the relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c because that's what you'd do in classical mechanics. But at relativistic speeds, I can't do that. I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. 

The formula is v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the first object from the perspective of the second, or something like that? Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is used when you have two velocities u and v from the same frame, and you want to find the velocity of one from the other's frame. So in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the second astronaut's frame, what is the speed of the first astronaut?

Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as the relative velocity of the first astronaut as seen from the second. Or is it the other way around? Since the second is moving slower, from the second's perspective, the first is moving at a higher speed. Let me get the formula right. The relative velocity u' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Here, u is the velocity of the first object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the second object in that frame. So wait, in the original frame, the first astronaut is moving at u = 0.6c, and the second at v = 0.5c. So, from the second astronaut's frame, what is the speed of the first astronaut?

Wait, actually, the formula is v', which is the speed of the first object from the perspective of the second. So plugging in, v' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Let me compute that:

v' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Simplify numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1-0.3 = 0.7.

So v' = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So that's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, I see option C and D have 0.14c for v_rel.

Wait, but wait a second. Which astronaut's frame are we looking at? The problem says "what will be the relative speed"—I think it's the speed of one as seen by the other. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference divided by the Lorentz factor term. So the calculation I did should be correct, giving roughly 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now for the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut. But wait, each is moving at their own speed, so their energies are their relativistic energies. So E_total = E1 + E2.

The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = Gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = Gamma2 * 3m c² = approx 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total E is E1 + E2 = 2.5mc² + 3.464mc² ≈ 5.964 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Gamma1: v=0.6c. So v²/c²=0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So 1/0.8=1.25. Correct.

Gamma1 * 2m = 1.25 * 2m = 2.5 m. Multiply by c² gives 2.5 m c². Right.

Gamma2: v=0.5c, so (v²/c²)=0.25. 1 - 0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)= approx 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

Gamma2 *3m = 1.1547 *3m ≈ 3.464 m. Multiply by c² is 3.464 m c².

So adding 2.5 +3.464 =5.964, which is about 5.96 mc². So option C says E=5.96 mc².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So option C is the one with the correct energy.

Wait, but what about the system's total energy? If the astronauts are moving relative to each other, the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame is different, but the problem doesn't specify which frame to compute the energy in. Oh, wait, the question says "the total energy of the system". I think the system's energy is the sum of the energies measured in the same frame as the velocities are given. Because each astronaut is part of the system, so their energies are each calculated in that frame and added.

Wait, but the problem says "the total energy of the system." So in the rest frame where both are moving? Or perhaps in the original frame where the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c? Because if you calculate each in that frame, sum them, that's the total energy in that frame.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the energy in the center-of-momentum frame, but I don't think that's the case here. The question doesn't specify any particular frame, but it's more likely that the total energy is the sum in the lab frame where their velocities are given.

So our earlier calculation holds, giving E ≈5.96 mc².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

That's one option. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me think again about the relative speed. The relative speed between the two astronauts is v_rel=0.14c. So option C has both the correct relative speed and the correct total energy.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is not simply the difference of their velocities. Instead, the relativistic velocity addition formula is used:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:
\[
0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:
\[
1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

So, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass: \( 2m \)
- Velocity: \( 0.6c \)

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass: \( 3m \)
- Velocity: \( 0.5c \)

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

---

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).
- The total energy of the system is \( E \approx 5.96m c^2 \).
