Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So, I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, right. In relativity, things aren't as straightforward as classical mechanics. I remember that velocities don't just add up normally when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. And for energy, I think each astronaut's energy is calculated using the relativistic energy formula, then summed together.

Let me start with the relative velocity. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c relative to the same frame (let's say the Earth frame), what's the speed of A relative to B?

Wait, no, wait. No, because in relativity, the relative speed isn't simply the difference. I think the formula for the relative velocity u' when one frame S' moves at speed v relative to S is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, in this case, who's moving relative to whom? If I'm sitting in B's frame, what is A's speed?

Alternatively, I can think of the Earth frame as the rest frame. Let me clarify: astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So, their velocities are u_A = 0.6c and u_B = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So, from B's perspective, how fast is A moving? Or wait, maybe the other way around? Wait, no, the relative speed of A with respect to B would be calculated by the velocity addition formula, but I have to be careful about the frame.

Wait, actually, the formula is u = (u_A - u_B') / (1 - (u_A u_B')/c² ), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/c² ). Wait, let me check that.

Yes, the relativistic velocity addition formula when you have two velocities u1 and u2 in the same direction is (u1 - u2) / (1 - (u1 u2)/c² ). Because in the Earth frame, astronaut A is moving faster than B. So, from B's frame, A is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that. Let's compute the numerator first: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Then the denominator: 1 - (0.6*0.5) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c when rounded. So looking at the options, that would be either option C or D, since they have 0.14c.

Wait, but wait: in the Earth frame, A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c. So, the velocity of A relative to B would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)) = 0.1c/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that's option C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's total energy is their rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but in relativity, it's given by gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A, with mass 2m and velocity 0.6c, gamma_A is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B, mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma_B is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = gamma_B *3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 ≈ 3.4642 m c².

But wait, wait a second. Because the rest energy is mc², so each's total energy is gamma * m c². So, for A, it's 2m * gamma_A * c². Wait, no, wait: E = gamma * m c². So A's energy is 2m * gamma_A * c²? No, wait. No, wait. No, the astronaut's rest mass is 2m, so E_A = gamma * (2m) * c². Similarly for B, E_B = gamma * (3m) * c².

Wait, let me recompute. So for A:

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

E_A = gamma_A * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For B:

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.154700538.

E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

So total energy E_total = E_A + E_B = 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So the correct energy is about 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

Wait, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D is same velocity but E=5 mc². So that would mean the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait, another thought: when considering the system's total energy, is it the sum of each astronaut's energy in the Earth frame? Because in relativity, each's energy is measured in the same frame, so yes, we just add them.

So the relative velocity is 0.14c, and the total energy is ~5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of astronaut A (moving at 0.6c) with respect to astronaut B (moving at 0.5c) is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u_1 - u_2}{1 - \frac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u_1 = 0.6c \) and \( u_2 = 0.5c \):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A:
- Mass \( m_A = 2m \)
- Velocity \( v_A = 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy \( E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### For astronaut B:
- Mass \( m_B = 3m \)
- Velocity \( v_B = 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy \( E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.9641m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \)
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \)

Comparing with the options:
- Option C: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2 \) (correct)
- Option D: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5m c^2 \) (incorrect)

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
