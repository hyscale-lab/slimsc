Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. Alright, the question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium. So the complex would be something like CaEDTA²−, I think.

The problem gives me the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. Wait, formation constants can be a bit tricky. I remember that the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−, the K would be [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, in this problem, we're told that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of CaEDTA²−. Since the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− before complexation would be what? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of dissociation.

Wait, no. Let me think about it. If the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−, that's the initial concentration. Then, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. The dissociation reaction would be CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−. The equilibrium expression would then be K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA²−].

Wait, but the formation constant K is given as 5e10. So the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So the dissociation constant would be Kd = 1/Kf. Because Kf is formation, Kd is dissociation. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So now, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming x is the amount dissociated, then:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kd is very small, x would be tiny compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

So plugging into Kd: (x)(x) / 0.02 = 2e-11
Which is x² = 0.02 * 2e-11
x² = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, so 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, so 2 times that is about 6.32e-7. Hmm, that looks familiar. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ ions would be 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

Wait a second, did I get the Kd right? Kd is 1/(5e10) which is 2e-11. Yes. And the equation setup seems correct. Let me double-check the math:

x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 → 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 * 2e-11 is (2*2) * 1e-13 → 4e-13. sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, but 6.5 is 1e-6.5 = 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. Yep, that's right.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex. The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) at equilibrium. The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \quad (\text{since } x \text{ is very small}),
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
