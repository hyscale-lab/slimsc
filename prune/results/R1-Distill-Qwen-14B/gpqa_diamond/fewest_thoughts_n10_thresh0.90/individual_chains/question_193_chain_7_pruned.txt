Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, right. Parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the parallax is small, that means the star is far away. The formula I think is distance (d) in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. So plx is 1/d.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But I need to relate this to distance. So since plx is 1/d, let's substitute that in.

So, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5). So 1 divided by (1/d^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So we're probably looking at the differential number of stars with respect to distance. Like, how does the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr depend on r.

Because when you count the number of stars in a region, you have to consider the volume of that region. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would depend on the volume of that shell, which is 4πr² dr. But that's when the number of stars increases with distance in a certain way.

Wait, but in this case, the number of stars N is proportional to d^5, which is r^5 because d is r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then how does the number per unit distance (or per unit range) change?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So N is proportional to plx^-5. Since plx is 1/d, then substituting, N is proportional to (1/d)^-5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, that's the total number in a region up to distance d? Or per unit distance? Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps I'm thinking in terms of the cumulative number as a function of distance, but the question is about the change in number per unit distance. So maybe we need to take the derivative.

Oh, right! Because when you have a number density that depends on distance, the number per unit volume (or per unit distance, in spherical shells) depends on that. So let's model this.

Let me think of the number of stars as a function of distance. Assume that the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr is dN, which depends on both the volume element and the number per unit volume.

Wait, but the initial statement is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps that is the number density (number per unit volume) as a function of parallax. Or is it the total number in a region with a certain parallax?

Wait, let's clarify. The problem says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So perhaps it's that the number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, that makes N proportional to d^5. But how does that translate into the number per unit distance?

Wait, perhaps I need to model the number of stars in shells. Let's say that the number density (number per unit volume) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me represent the number density as n(stars) = k * (1/(plx))^
