Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let me think about it. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my parallax and distance relationships. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) equals 1 over distance (d) in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ d^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, I think that refers to the differential—like the number of stars per unit distance interval. So I need to find dN/dr, the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So perhaps it's looking for the dependence of N on r, but considering that N is integrated over some volume, or maybe it's the number density?

Alternatively, maybe it's about the density of stars as a function of distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then what is the dependence on r (since r is distance)? But wait, if N ∝ d^5, then as r increases, N increases as well. But the options are about the change in the number of stars with distance.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential number. So dN/dr is the number of stars per unit distance. Let's see, N is proportional to r^5. So dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, the options don't have 5, but they do have r^4 as option C.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and since plx is 1/r (assuming r is in parsecs?), so N ∝ r^5.

So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases as r^5. So when you're looking at per unit range of distance, like the number of stars at a particular distance range, that's the derivative. So dN/dr is 5 r^4.

But the question isn't asking for the derivative. It's asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So it's the rate of change. So, if N increases as r^5, then the rate of change (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be increasing as r^4. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, when looking at the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r, the number of stars would be proportional to the volume of that shell multiplied by the density. But wait, in this case, the number of stars might not be dependent on the volume. The question states that N varies as 1/plx^5, which is given, so perhaps that's all I need to consider.

Alternatively, maybe the initial thought is correct. If N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would be proportional to r^4.

So looking back at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This implies the need to consider the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: C
