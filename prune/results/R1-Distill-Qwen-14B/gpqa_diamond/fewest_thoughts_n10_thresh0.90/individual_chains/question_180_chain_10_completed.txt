--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let me read it again carefully. 

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, so I remember that the potential energy in an electrostatic system comes from the interactions between charges. Since all the charges are identical and repelling each other, the potential energy should be positive. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So maybe we're considering the energy when the system is arranged in the most stable configuration, perhaps when all the charges are as close as possible or something. But wait, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed there. So the 12 are all at 2 meters, and the 13th is at the center.

Wait, so the setup is that there's a central charge (charge 13) fixed at P, and 12 charges each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the 12 charges are arranged in some way around P, but all exactly 2 meters away. Since they are identical and repelling, if they could move, they'd move away, but here they are constrained to 2 m.

So the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Since the system is isolated, I can consider all the interactions.

But wait, the charges are 2e each. So each charge is 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.2e-19 C.

So the potential energy U between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1*q2) / r. But in this case, since all the charges are the same, the potential energy between any two will be the same.

Wait, but how many such pairs are there? Let me think. There are 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are at 2m from P. Wait, so each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from P, but what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Because all 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. But the problem doesn't specify any particular arrangement beyond that. Hmm, but since the problem is about the minimum energy, maybe the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Wait, but for identical charges, the potential energy between them is repulsive, so to minimize the total potential energy, the system would arrange them as far apart as possible. But wait, the 12 are constrained to be at a fixed distance from P, so perhaps the minimal energy would be when the 12 are as far apart as possible given that constraint. Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the potential energy only considers the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, and not their mutual interactions. Hmm, that would make the problem easier, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says the system consists of 13 identical particles. So each has a charge of 2e. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P. So the potential energy would consist of two parts: the energy due to the 12 charges interacting with the fixed charge at P, and the energy due to the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Ah, so I can't ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. So I need to calculate both contributions.

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So to minimize the potential energy, the system would arrange itself in the configuration that minimizes the total potential energy. But wait, for point charges that repel each other, the minimum potential energy occurs when they are as far apart as possible. But in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their positions can vary in the plane or sphere of radius 2m. So to minimize the potential energy, they would arrange themselves as far apart as possible within that constraint. But what's the minimal potential energy configuration? Hmm, perhaps arranging them equally spaced on a sphere around P. But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and not their mutual interactions. Because if I include the mutual interactions, the energy would be higher, so perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge interactions.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system, which would include all interactions. Hmm, but perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are zero or can be neglected. Or perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are fixed in place and cannot move relative to each other, so their mutual distances are fixed as well. But the problem statement isn't clear on this. Since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe I can proceed under the assumption that only the interactions between each of the 12 and the central charge are considered. Because including the mutual interactions would complicate things a lot, and perhaps the problem doesn't require that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are fixed on a sphere of radius 2m around P, so their mutual distances are determined by that arrangement. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's difficult to compute their mutual potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. Because if the 12 are fixed in place, their mutual interactions are fixed as well, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the question is only asking about the energy between the 12 charges and the central one.

Wait, the problem says "the minimum energy of this system". So the minimum would probably be when the system's energy is as low as possible. Since all charges are positive (2e each), the system's potential energy is positive. But wait, if the system is isolated, the energy can't change unless work is done on it. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's think again. The system consists of 13 charges: 12 at 2m from P, and the 13th fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th. So the potential energy between each pair (the 13th and each of the 12) is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). But wait, each of these 12 interactions would contribute to the total potential energy.

So for each of the 12 charges, the energy with the central one is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy from these interactions is 12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, but what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Since they are all 2e and repel each other, the potential energy between each pair would add to the total. So the total potential energy would be the sum of all these interactions.

But calculating that would require knowing the distances between each pair of the 12 charges. Since the 12 are constrained at 2m from P, their mutual distances could vary, but for the minimal potential energy, they should be placed as far apart as possible, but given the constraints, perhaps the minimal mutual potential energy is when they are as close as possible, but it's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is negligible or that the charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are such that the potential energy doesn't contribute significantly. Or maybe the problem only considers the potential energies between each of the 12 and the central charge.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that only the central charge's interactions are considered. Let me proceed under that assumption, and see if the answer matches one of the options.

So, the potential energy U is the sum of the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the central charge.

Each such interaction is U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

Wait, substituting the values:

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.602e-19 C.

So each U_i is (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / (2 * 2). Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 2e is the charge of each particle. So (2e) squared is 4e². So each U_i would be k*(4e²)/(r), where r is 2m.

Wait, but the denominator is r, which is 2m. So the calculation for each U_i is (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.602e-19)^2) / (2 * 2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 4e²: 4*(1.602e-19)^2.

1.602e-19 squared is (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = approx 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 4: 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37 C².

Then, multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = Let's calculate that.

8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = (8.988 * 1.0264) * 1e-28.

8.988 * 1.0264 ≈ Let's compute: 8 * 1.0264 is approx 8.2112, 0.988 * 1.0264 is about 1.014. So total approx 9.225. So 9.225e-28.

But wait, the denominator is 2 * 2m? Wait, wait, the distance is 2m, so r=2m. The formula is U = k q1 q2 / r. So each U_i is k*(2e)^2/(2m). So in the denominator, it's 2m.

Wait, so that calculation was for U_i = k*(4e²)/(2m). So 4e² is 4*(1.602e-19)^2, which is 1.0264e-37 C², as before.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / (2 * 2). Wait, wait, 2m is the distance. So r is 2m, which is 2 * 2 = 4 meters? Wait no, no. Wait, the distance is 2 meters. So r is 2 m, so denominator is 2 m.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's recompute.

Each U_i is (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m). So substituting:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²,

(2e)^2 = 4e² = 4*(1.602e-19 C)^2 = 4*(2.566e-38 C²) = 1.0264e-37 C².

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / (2 m).

Wait, 2 m is 2 meters, so denominator is 2. So the calculation is 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 / 2.

Compute numerator first: 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 ≈ (8.988 * 1.0264) * 1e-28. 

8.988 * 1.0264 ≈ Let me compute that: 8 * 1.0264=8.2112; 0.988 * 1.0264 ≈ 1.014. So total is approx 9.225.

So 9.225e-28.

Then divide by 2: 9.225e-28 / 2 = 4.6125e-28 J per interaction.

But each of the 12 charges contributes this. So total U is 12 * 4.6125e-28 J = 5.535e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, that's with the assumption that the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are not considered. So if I only consider the central charge interactions, the energy is about 5.5e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about ten times higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate.

Compute each U_i: U_i = k * (2e)^2 / (2 m).

Wait, with k = 8.988e9, (2e)^2 =4e² =4*(1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = approximately 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 4: 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / 2.

So 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 * 1.0264. Let's compute 8 * 1.0264 = 8.2112; 0.988 * 1.0264 ≈ 1.014. So 8.2112 +1.014 ≈9.2252.

So 9.2252e-28. Now divide by 2: 4.6126e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.6126e-28 * 12 = 5.5351e-27 J.

So approximately 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option C) 7.056e-27.

Hmm. So 5.535e-27 is not an option. The options are A) 5.645e-26, B) 2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Wait, my calculation gives about 5.5e-27, but option C is 7.056e-27. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recheck the calculations.

First, compute (2e)^2:

(2e)^2 = 4e² = 4*(1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37.

U_i = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / (2).

So 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = (8.988 * 1.0264) * 1e9 * 1e-37.

8.988 * 1.0264: Let's compute more accurately.

1.0264 * 8 = 8.2112.

1.0264 * 0.988 = Let's compute:

0.988 * 1 = 0.988.

0.988 * 0.0264 = approximately 0.0261 (since 0.02 * 0.0264=0.000528, but wait wait, perhaps it's better to compute 0.988 *1.0264.

Wait, 1.0264 * 0.988:

Multiply 1.0264 * 1000 = 1026.4.

Multiply 1000 * 0.988 = 988.

So 1.0264 * 0.988 = (1026.4 * 988) / (1e6).

Wait, perhaps an easier way: 1.0264 * 0.988 = approx 1.014.

So total is 8.2112 + 1.014 ≈9.2252.

So 9.2252e-28 per U_i.

Wait, because 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = 9.2252e-28. Then divide by 2: 4.6126e-28.

Multiply by 12: 5.535e-27 J.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should include the potential energies between the 12 charges as well. Because each pair of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy.

So if I ignore that part, I get 5.5e-27 J, which is not an option. So maybe the correct approach is to include all pairs.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of all pairs: the 12 pairs with the central charge, and the C(12,2) = 66 pairs among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, let's see. Each of the 12 charges contributes U_i as calculated, so 12 * U_i.

Additionally, each pair among the 12 contributes U_ij = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute r_ij for each pair. However, perhaps the problem assumes that all the 12 charges are placed in such a way that their mutual distances are all the same. But that would require them to form a regular dodecahedron or something, but perhaps it's too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are either zero or ignored. But that would leave the energy as 5.5e-27 J, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times higher than my previous calculation. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.28 times my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions. Let's think again: the central charge is fixed, and each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge once. So 12 interactions.

But I'm probably missing the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. So each pair of the 12 contributes to the potential energy. So the mutual interactions would add another term.

So the total potential energy is U = U_central + U_mutual.

U_central is the sum of the 12 interactions with the central charge, which is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

U_mutual is the sum over all pairs of the 12 charges: for each pair, (k*(2e)^2)/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

But without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other. But that's only possible if they are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something, but perhaps the minimal energy configuration would have them as far apart as possible. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all the same, but that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energy can be neglected, which would make the energy only from the central charge. But that doesn't lead to any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U_central. Let me recalculate.

Each U_i is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2 * 2 m)?

Wait, no, wait the distance is 2m, so r is 2m, not 4m.

Wait, no, the central charge is at P, and each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So each U_i is (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m) = (k*(4e²))/(2m).

So substituting numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C²,

e = 1.602e-19 C,

m = 2 meters.

So U_i = (8.988e9 * 4 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) / (2 * 2).

Wait, wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters, not 2 times 2.

Wait, wait, the denominator is 2 m. So:

U_i = (8.988e9) * ( (2e)^2 ) / (2 m )

= 8.988e9 * (4e²) / (2 * 2 ) ?

No, no, the denominator is 2m, so it's just 2 in meters. So:

U_i = (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.602e-19)^2) / (2 * 2 ) ?

Wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters. So 2 m. So U_i = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2 * 2 ) ?

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct the calculation.

Wait, no, 2e is the charge, and the denominator is 2 m.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * ( (2e) * (2e) ) / (2 m )

= (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2 * 2 m) ?

Wait, no, I'm making a confusion here. Let's clarify.

The distance r is 2 m.

So U_i = (k * q1 * q2 ) / r

Here, q1 and q2 are each 2e.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m )

= (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2 m )

Wait, because r is 2 m, so denominator is 2.

So substituting:

4e² =4 * (1.602e-19)^2 =4 *2.566e-38 =1.0264e-37 C².

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / (2 * 1) m.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = (8.988 * 1.0264) * 1e-28.

8.988 * 1.0264 ≈ 9.225.

So 9.225e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6125e-28 J per U_i.

Multiply by 12: 5.535e-27 J.

So U_central =5.535e-27 J.

But where do the mutual interactions come in? For the 12 charges, each pair contributes U_ij =k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, how can we compute this? Perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are 2m as well. But that's not possible for all pairs, unless the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron with each pair at 2m, which isn't possible because the maximum number of equidistant points in 3D space is 4 (tetrahedron), so 12 points can't all be equidistant.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distances are 2m. But that can't be true for all pairs, so perhaps the problem is ignoring the mutual interactions, which would make the total energy U_central =5.535e-27 J. But none of the options match this.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Which is about 1.27 times my U_central.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions. Wait, 12 charges each have an interaction with the central charge, so 12 terms.

But maybe I should consider that each charge interacts with the central charge twice? No, that doesn't make sense. Each charge interacts once.

Alternatively, maybe I should double the U_central because I'm considering both the central charge and each of the 12. But no, the 13th is fixed, so each of the 12 interacts once.

Hmm, perhaps I should include all possible pairs, including the central charge, but perhaps I'm missing some factor.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum over all pairs. So in this case, the pairs are:

- 12 pairs between each of the 12 and the central charge.

- C(12, 2) = 66 pairs among the 12 charges.

So the total U is U_central + U_mutual.

But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute U_mutual. So perhaps the problem expects me to ignore U_mutual, which is probably a huge number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge interactions, but that's unclear.

Wait, but the only option that is on the same order of magnitude as 5.5e-27 is option C, 7.056e-27, which is about 1.28 times that. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should have a different exponent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Compute (2e)^2: 4e² =4*(1.602e-19)^2 =4*(2.566e-38) =1.0264e-37.

Then U_i = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / (2 m).

Wait, 2 m is the denominator, so 2. So U_i = (8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 ) / 2.

Compute 8.988e9 *1.0264e-37:

= (8.988 * 1.0264) *1e9 *1e-37

= (approximately 9.225) *1e-28.

So 9.225e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6125e-28.

Multiply by 12: 5.535e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the distance as 2 meters between the 12 charges and the central charge, but the mutual distances are 4 meters apart, which would make their potential energy zero, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2 meters, which would make each U_ij = k*(2e)^2/(2 m) = same as U_i, but that would be incorrect because mutual distances can't all be 2m.

Wait, if all the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, then the distance between any two would be 2 * 2 * sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. But without knowing theta, I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 2 meters, but that's not possible for all pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are being ignored, which would leave U =5.535e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A) 5.645e-26 J.

Option B) 2.822e-26 J.

Option C) 7.056e-27 J.

Option D) 122.330 J.

Wait, my calculation gives about 5.535e-27 J, which would be about 5.5e-27, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, wait, I think I see a mistake. I used 2m in the denominator, but 2m is 2 meters, so the denominator is 2, not 2 meters. But in the units, it's meters. Let me re-express the calculation correctly.

Wait, the distance r is 2 meters, so U_i = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2 meters).

Wait, but 2 meters is 2 m, so 2 in the denominator.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2.

Wait, no, wait, the denominator is 2 m, so the units are correct. So the calculation should be:

U_i = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (4e² C²) / (2 m) )

= (8.988e9 *4e² / 2 ) * (N·m²/C² * C²) / m )

= (8.988e9 *4e² / 2 ) * N·m.

Which is (8.988e9 * 4e² /2 ) J.

Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 4e² =4*(1.602e-19)^2 =1.0264e-37.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / 2.

Which is (8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 ) / 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 = (8.988 *1.0264) * 1e-28.

8.988 *1.0264 ≈9.225.

So 9.225e-28.

Divide by 2:4.6125e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.535e-27 J.

Same result as before.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge. Each charge is 2e, so (2e)^2 is 4e². So that's correct.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps all 13 charges are identical, and the system's potential energy is the sum of all possible pairs. So the total number of pairs is C(13,2) =78. But one of them is the central charge and the other 12. So the 12 interactions with the central charge, and the 66 interactions among the 12.

But again, without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute the mutual interactions.

Wait, perhaps the mutual interactions are being considered, and perhaps the potential energy between them is negligible compared to the central charge interactions. But that doesn't seem to be the case, as for 12 charges, the mutual interactions would be a lot.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the potential energy when a charge is placed at P. Wait, perhaps the 13th charge is being placed at P, and the other 12 were already there. So the work done in bringing the 13th charge from infinity to P is the potential energy.

Wait, but the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P. So when bringing the 13th charge to P, the potential energy would be the sum of the work done against the electric field of the 12 charges.

Wait, that would make sense. So the potential energy would be the work done to bring the 13th charge to P, considering the potential due to the 12 charges.

So U = q * V, where V is the potential at P due to the 12 charges.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e at a distance of 2m, so the potential V due to each is (k*(2e))/(2m).

So V = sum of potentials from each charge.

Each V_i = (k*(2e))/(2m).

So for 12 charges, V = 12*(k*(2e))/(2m).

Then, U = (2e) * V = 2e * [12*(k*(2e))/(2m)].

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute V first:

V = 12 * (k*(2e))/(2m) = 12 * ( (8.988e9)*(2e) )/(2*2).

Wait, 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

Wait, more correctly:

Each V_i = (k * q ) / r = (8.988e9) * (2e) / (2 m).

So V_i = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19) / (2 * 2).

Wait, 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So denominator is 2 * 2 m =4 m.

Wait, no, the distance is 2 m.

So V_i = (8.988e9 * 3.204e-19 ) / 2.

Compute that:

8.988e9 * 3.204e-19 = (8.988 *3.204) * 1e-10.

8.988 *3.204 ≈ 28.8.

So 28.8e-10 = 2.88e-9.

Divide by 2: 1.44e-9.

So V_i is 1.44e-9 V.

Wait, no, no, wait: 8.988e9 *3.204e-19 =?

8.988e9 *3.204e-19 = (8.988 *3.204) * 1e9 *1e-19 = 28.8 * 1e-10 = 2.88e-9.

Then, divide by 2 m: because r is 2 m.

So V_i = (2.88e-9) / 2 = 1.44e-9 V.

So each charge contributes 1.44e-9 V.

Multiply by 12: V_total = 12 * 1.44e-9 = 1.728e-8 V.

Then, the potential energy U is q * V, where q is the 13th charge, which is 2e.

So U = (2e) * (1.728e-8 V).

2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So U = 3.204e-19 * 1.728e-8 = ?

3.204e-19 * 1.728e-8 = (3.204 *1.728) * 1e-27.

3.204 *1.728 ≈5.54.

So U ≈5.54e-27 J.

Which is approximately 5.54e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of V.

Wait, let me recompute.

Each V_i is (k * q ) / r.

k=8.988e9,

q=2e=3.204e-19 C,

r=2 m.

So V_i = (8.988e9 * 3.204e-19) / 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *3.204e-19 = (8.988 *3.204) * 1e-10.

8.988 *3.204 ≈28.8.

So 28.8e-10 = 2.88e-9.

Divide by 2: 1.44e-9 V.

So each charge gives 1.44e-9 V.

12 charges: 12 *1.44e-9 =1.728e-8 V.

So the potential at P is 1.728e-8 V.

U = q * V = (2e) * (1.728e-8 V).

2e =3.204e-19 C.

So 3.204e-19 *1.728e-8 = ?

3.204 *1.728 ≈5.54.

So 5.54e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before. So the potential energy is approximately 5.54e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27 J, but that's about 27% higher.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the approach?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the potential energy between all pairs, including both the central charge and the 12 charges.

Wait, let me try to compute U_mutual, the potential energy between the 12 charges.

If all 12 charges are placed at 2m from P, perhaps they form a regular icosahedron around P. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's difficult to compute the exact potential energy. However, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from each other, which would be an incorrect assumption, but let's proceed.

Assuming that each of the 12 charges is 2m apart from each other, then each pair contributes U_ij =k*(2e)^2/(2m) = same as U_i.

So each mutual pair would contribute 4.6125e-28 J.

With 66 pairs, U_mutual =66 *4.6125e-28 = 3.04575e-26 J.

Then, the total U would be U_central + U_mutual =5.535e-27 +3.04575e-26 =3.599e-26 J.

But none of the options match this either.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 4m, which would make each U_ij = (k*(2e)^2)/(4m) = (8.988e9 *4e²)/(4*2).

Wait, 4e² is 1.0264e-37.

So U_ij = (8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 )/(4*2) = ?

Wait, denominator is 4*2=8 m.

So (8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 )= 9.225e-28.

Divide by 8: 1.1531e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 66: 66 *1.1531e-28 ≈7.599e-27 J.

Then, U_central is 5.535e-27, so total U=5.535e-27 +7.599e-27=1.3134e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all the same but not 2m. Maybe assuming that they are arranged in a sphere and each mutual distance is 4m, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges, but I may have made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again: the potential energy when moving the 13th charge to P is the sum of the work done against the electric fields of the 12 charges.

Each charge contributes V_i = (k*(2e))/(2m).

So V=12 * V_i=12*(k*(2e))/(2m).

Then, U= (2e)*V = (2e) * [12*(k*(2e))/(2m)].

So U= (2e) * [ (12 *k *2e )/(2m) ) ].

Simplify: 2e * (24 e k )/(2m) )= (2e *24 e k )/(2m).

= (48 e² k )/(2m).

=24 e² k / m.

Substituting the values:

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C²,

e=1.602e-19 C,

m=2 m.

So U=24*(1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9 / 2.

Compute numerator: 24*(1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

24 *2.566e-38 =6.158e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9:6.158e-37 *8.988e9 = (6.158 *8.988) * 1e-28.

6.158 *8.988≈55.35.

So 55.35e-28=5.535e-27.

Divide by 2: U=5.535e-27 / 2=2.7675e-27 J.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute again:

U=24 * (e)^2 *k / m.

Wait, no, the expression was 24 e² k / m.

Wait, substituting:

24*(1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9 / (2).

So:

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

24 *2.566e-38 =6.158e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9:6.158e-37 *8.988e9 =55.35e-28 =5.535e-27.

Divide by 2:5.535e-27 /2=2.7675e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.77e-27 J.

Looking at the options, this is close to option B (2.822e-26) but about a tenth. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, in the expression:

U=24 e² k / m.

Compute each part:

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

k=8.988e9.

m=2.

So U=24 *2.566e-38 *8.988e9 /2.

Compute numerator and denominator:

24 *2.566e-38 =6.158e-37.

6.158e-37 *8.988e9 = (6.158 *8.988) * 1e-28.

6.158 *8.988≈55.35.

So 55.35e-28 =5.535e-27.

Divide by 2:5.535e-27/2=2.7675e-27 J.

So U=2.7675e-27 J.

But this is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, but without considering the potential energy brought by the 12 charges in place.

Wait, but that would be the same as what I calculated earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: all the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P. The 13th is placed at P. So the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

So the total U is U = U_central + U_mutual.

Where U_central is the energy between the central charge and each of the 12, which is 12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

U_mutual is the sum of the energies between each pair of the 12 charges, which is C(12,2)*(k*(2e)^2)/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

But without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are 2m, which is incorrect, but perhaps that's what is intended.

So if each pair of the 12 charges is 2m apart, then U_mutual would be C(12,2) * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Which is 66 * (8.988e9 * (4e²))/(2 *2).

Compute each U_ij: (8.988e9 *4e²)/4.

Wait, denominator is 4 m (since 2m each way?), no, wait, no, r_ij is 2m, so denominator is 2.

Wait, U_ij = (8.988e9 *4e²)/2.

But 4e² is 1.0264e-37.

So U_ij = (8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 ) /2.

Which is (9.225e-28)/2=4.6125e-28 per U_ij.

Multiply by 66: 66 *4.6125e-28=3.04575e-26 J.

Then, U_central is 5.535e-27 J.

Total U=5.535e-27 +3.04575e-26=3.599e-26 J.

Still, this doesn't match any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge interactions, and the correct answer is approximately 5.535e-27 J, but none of the options match. The closest is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is about 28% higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U_central.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the potential energy of a system of charges, which is U = (1/2) * sum over all pairs.

Wait, but I already considered all pairs.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual potential energy is zero. But that's impossible because like charges repel.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered as zero because they are constrained to 2m and can't move, so their potential energy is fixed and not counted. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the central charge and the 12, and nothing else.

Wait, maybe I should just pick the option that's closest to my calculation of 5.535e-27 J. The options are A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Hmm, 5.5e-27 is between option C (7e-27) and option B (2.8e-26). But 5.5e-27 is closer to option C than to B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions. Let me check again.

Wait, the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, so 12 interactions. Each contributes U_i= (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So 12 * U_i =12 * (8.988e9 *4e²)/(2m).

Wait, but maybe I should have used 13 charges, including the central one. No, because the central one is fixed, and the others are 12.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy due to the 12 charges alone, but that doesn't make sense because the 13th is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy of a charge in an electric field, U = qV, where V is the potential due to all other charges.

Which is what I calculated earlier, giving U≈5.5e-27 J.

But no option matches that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (k * q^2) / (r) for each charge, but multiplied by some factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the energy of a charge in the field of other charges, and not considering the mutual energy. So total U is 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e))/(2m) =12 * (k*(4e²))/(2m).

Which is what I did earlier.

But perhaps in the problem, the 13th charge is not included in the potential calculation. Or perhaps the 12 charges are being considered as a single entity, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, another way: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, summed.

Which would be 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So 12 * (8.988e9 *4e² )/(2*2).

Wait, 2m is the distance, so denominator is 2.

So 12 * [ (8.988e9 *4e² ) / 2 ].

Compute 4e²=4*(1.602e-19)^2=1.0264e-37.

So each term is (8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 ) /2.

Which is (9.225e-28)/2=4.6125e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.535e-27 J.

But the options don't have this value.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is included, but I'm not calculating it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each pair of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m, which would make U_ij = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So each pair contributes 4.6125e-28 J.

Number of pairs: C(12,2)=66.

So U_mutual=66 *4.6125e-28 = 3.04575e-26 J.

Then, U_central=5.535e-27 J.

Total U=3.04575e-26 +5.535e-27 = 3.599e-26 J.

Which is 3.6e-26 J, but no option matches this.

Hmm. I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. Given the options, and the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The closest calculation I did was when considering bringing the 13th charge to P, which gave me 5.54e-27 J. The option closest to that is option C:7.056e-27, but it's about 28% higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes twice: once as the charge being moved and once as the charge creating the potential. Wait, no, that would be double-counting.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have multiplied by 2 because each charge contributes twice.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Each interaction is counted once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula (k q^2)/(r) and multiplied by the number of charges.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for the option that best fits the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (k q1 q2)/r for each pair, and not considering any other factors. So for each of the 12 charges, U= (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). So 12 * U =12*(8.988e9 *4e²)/(2*2).

Wait, denominator is 2*2=4?

No, because the distance is 2 m, so denominator is 2.

So 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) =12*(8.988e9 *4e²)/(2*2).

Wait, no, no: wait, 2e is the charge, so (2e)^2 is 4e², and the distance is 2 m.

So each U_i= (8.988e9 *4e² )/(2 *1) [since 2m is 2].

So 8.988e9 *4e² =8.988e9 *4*(1.602e-19)^2.

Which is 8.988e9 * 4*2.566e-38 =8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 =9.225e-28.

Divide by 2:4.6125e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.535e-27 J.

So again, same result.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the problem said that 12 charges are at 2m from P, but the 13th is at P, so the distance between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2m. So when the 13th is placed, the potential at P is due to the 12 charges.

Thus, the potential energy is U = q * V, where q is the 13th charge, and V is the potential at P due to the 12.

Each charge contributes V_i =k*(2e)/(2m).

So V=12 * [k*(2e)/(2m)] =12*(k e)/(m).

Then, U=(2e)*V =2e *12*(k e)/(m) =24 e² k /m.

Substituting:

e=1.602e-19 C,

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C²,

m=2 m.

So U=24*(1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9 /2.

Compute:

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

24 *2.566e-38 =6.158e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9:6.158e-37 *8.988e9 =55.35e-28 =5.535e-27.

Divide by 2:2.7675e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 13th charge is being placed in the field of the 12, but the 12 are also moving. But the problem states that 12 are constrained to stay at 2m, so their positions don't change.

I think I've reached the limit of my analysis. Given the options, I'll have to choose the closest one, which is option C)7.056e-27 J. But I'm not confident.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we consider the potential energy contributions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from a fixed charge at point \( P \), which is the 13th charge. The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the interactions between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, as well as the mutual interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Energy between the central charge and each of the 12 charges**:
   The potential energy between two charges is given by:
   \[
   U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
   \]
   Here, \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \). Substituting:
   \[
   U_i = k \frac{(2e)^2}{2} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 4 \cdot (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2}
   \]
   Compute \( (2e)^2 = 4e^2 = 4 \cdot (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 1.0264 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{C}^2 \). Substituting:
   \[
   U_i = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 1.0264 \times 10^{-37}}{2} = 4.6125 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Since there are 12 such interactions:
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot 4.6125 \times 10^{-28} = 5.535 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Mutual potential energy between the 12 charges**:
   The mutual potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges is:
   \[
   U_{ij} = k \frac{(2e)^2}{r_{ij}}
   \]
   Without explicit information about the distances \( r_{ij} \) between the 12 charges, it is challenging to compute the exact value. However, assuming the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are \( 2 \, \text{m} \), each pair contributes:
   \[
   U_{ij} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 1.0264 \times 10^{-37}}{2} = 4.6125 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]
   There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) such pairs, so:
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual}} = 66 \cdot 4.6125 \times 10^{-28} = 3.04575 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Total potential energy**:
   Adding the contributions:
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{central}} + U_{\text{mutual}} = 5.535 \times 10^{-27} + 3.04575 \times 10^{-26} = 3.599 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Comparison with Options:
The calculated value of \( U_{\text{total}} = 3.6 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest match to the initial calculation (ignoring mutual interactions) is \( 5.535 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \), which is approximately 28% lower than option C (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)). Given the ambiguity in the problem and the lack of explicit mutual distance information, the most reasonable choice is **option C**.

ANSWER: C
