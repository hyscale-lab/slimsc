Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the minimum energy of a system of charges. Alright, I'll start by breaking down the problem.

So there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, so each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about any kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy, I think.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Wait, so the 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the 13th is right at P. So the setup is like the 12 are arranged in a sphere around the 13th, each 2 meters away.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, since all the charges are the same sign (they're each 2e), they're all positive, so they repel each other. That means the potential energy would be positive because like charges repel, and we're dealing with electrostatic potential energy here.

Wait, but to find the minimum energy, maybe I should think about how the potential energy is calculated for a system of point charges. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, right?

But when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. So for n charges, it's the sum over all unique pairs. I remember the formula for N point charges: U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) * sum_{i<j} (q_i q_j)/r_ij. But since in this case, all the 12 charges are at the same distance from the 13th, and all the 12 are identical and fixed at 2 meters.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, which is where the 13th charge is. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the 12 are on a sphere of radius 2m. So for the potential energy calculation, each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of the 13th, but also, the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves matters.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The system's total potential energy will be the sum of the potential energy between all pairs. So that includes:

1. The potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges.
2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, when the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, and since they're identical and the system is symmetric, maybe the calculation simplifies.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P, so maybe the potential energy due to the 13th charge and the 12 others is just the sum of each pair. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the 13th is (2e)(2e)/(2m), but wait, no. Wait, the charge at P is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So each pair (13th and ith charge) contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Since there are 12 such pairs, that's 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)].

But wait, wait. Actually, when considering the potential energy of the entire system, the term for the 13th charge interacting with each of the 12 is (1/(4πε₀)) * sum (q1 q2 / r) for each pair. So that's 12 terms, each being (2e)(2e)/(2m). So that's 12*(4e²)/(2m).

But wait, no. Coulomb's constant k is 1/(4πε₀), so the potential energy is U = k * (q1*q2)/r. So for each pair between the 13th and the 12, that's k * (2e)(2e)/(2m). So that's 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)].

Wait, but wait another thing. The 13th charge is fixed, so when considering the potential energy of the system, do we count it as being part of the system? Because in the case of a fixed charge, some might consider that its potential energy is not part of the system's energy, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem states it's an isolated system, so all the charges are part of it. So the 13th is part of the system, meaning all interactions must be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the work done to assemble the system. So when assembling, the 13th charge is placed at P, then each of the 12 charges is brought into place at 2 m from P, and then we also have to account for the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the configuration is the one where the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2m around the 13th. But since the charges are fixed at 2 m, their positions are fixed, so the potential energy due to their mutual repulsion is a fixed value.

Let me think about how to compute this. The total potential energy U is the sum of all pairwise potentials. So:

U = sum_{i<j} [k * q_i q_j / r_ij]

In this case, the 13th charge (let's call it charge A) is at the center, and the other 12 (charges B1 to B12) are each at a distance of 2 m from A. So for each charge Bi, r_Ai = 2 m.

But between any two Bi and Bj, what is r_ij? Since all the Bi are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m, the distance between any two Bi and Bj depends on the angle between them. But wait, wait, in the case of a sphere, the distance between any two points on the sphere's surface is 2 * R * sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them as seen from the center. But if all the 12 charges are identical and placed symmetrically, perhaps the distance between any two is the same. Wait, no, that's only true for certain numbers. For example, for 6 charges on a sphere, each pair would be separated by 60 degrees, so the chord length would be 2R sin(30°) = R. But for 12 charges, perhaps each is at 30 degrees from its neighbor? Wait, but 12 points on a sphere, equally spaced, would form a regular icosahedron or something. Hmm, but the exact value might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by assuming that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are much larger than 2 m, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, the problem might ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges, considering maybe that the energy is dominated by the terms involving the central charge. But wait, the problem states to find the minimum energy, so I should account for all terms.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to find the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12, and sum them all.

So let me compute each part.

First, the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12. Each charge is 2e, so each has charge q = 2e. The distance between the 13th (at P) and each of the 12 is 2 m.

So for each pair between the central charge and a surrounding charge, the potential energy is U = k * (2e)(2e) / (2m) = k * (4e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

Since there are 12 such pairs, this contributes 12 * 2k e²/m = 24 k e²/m.

But wait, wait. Wait, when you have multiple charges, each pair is considered once. So the central charge is interacting with each of the 12, giving 12 terms. Each term is (2e)(2e)/(2m) multiplied by k. So yes, 12 * (4e² * k)/(2m) = 24 k e²/(2m) ? Wait, wait, 4e² *k divided by 2m is 2k e²/m. Multiply by 12 gives 24 k e²/m? Wait, no, 12 * 2k e²/m would be 24, but let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 4e² * k is the numerator, divided by 2 meters, so 4e²k/(2 m) = 2 e² k / m. So each of the 12 pairs contributes 2 e² k / m. So 12 * 2 e² k / m is 24 e² k / m.

Wait no, wait. Because in the formula, each pair is considered once. Oh wait, no, because the central charge is fixed, so each of the 12 surrounding charges interacts with the central one. So each interaction is a pair, and there are 12 pairs. So this part is correct.

Now, the next part is the potential energy between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges. So how many such pairs are there? For n charges, it's n choose 2, so 12 choose 2 is (12 * 11)/2 = 66 pairs.

Each of these 66 pairs has charges 2e and 2e, and their separation is the distance between any two on the sphere. Wait, but what is that distance? Oh, this is the tricky part. Because if the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere of radius R=2m, then the distance between any two adjacent charges would be the chord length, which is 2R sin(π/6), because for 12 points, each is separated by 30 degrees (since 360/12 = 30). So chord length is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is 30 degrees (π/6 radians). So sin(π/12) is the sine of 15 degrees, which is approximately 0.2588.

So the chord length between two adjacent charges would be 2 * 2m * sin(15 degrees) ≈ 4m * 0.2588 ≈ 1.035 m.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because 12 points on a sphere would form a regular icosahedron? Or maybe an icosahedron has 12 vertices. Hmm, perhaps the exact distance depends on the structure, but maybe for the sake of this problem, we can assume that all the 12 charges are equally spaced such that the distance between any two is the same. But wait, that's only possible in a very symmetric configuration, which perhaps isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies and the mutual distances between the 12 charges are 2 m as well, but that doesn't make sense because they're arranged on the sphere of radius 2 m.

Hmm, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. Wait, but that seems unlikely. Because each charge is identical and repelling, their mutual potential energy would contribute significantly. So the problem must require including that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are not 2 m. Let me think again. The 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2 m. So the distance between any two charges on the sphere's surface depends on the angle between their position vectors from the center. So for two charges, the angle would be determined by their placement. For 12 equally spaced points on a sphere, each would be separated by 30 degrees. So the chord length (distance between them) would be 2R sin(theta/2), with theta being 30 degrees. So sin(15°) is approximately 0.2588. So the chord length is 2 * 2 m * 0.2588 ≈ 1.035 m, as I thought earlier.

So each of the 66 pairs would have a distance of approximately 1.035 meters. So the potential energy between each pair would be U = k * (2e)(2e) / r, where r is 1.035 m. So each pair contributes (4e² k)/1.035 m.

But wait, but this is a simplification. Because in reality, the charges are arranged symmetrically, and each pair has the same distance, so we can compute the potential energy for each pair and multiply by the number of pairs.

So for the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, each contributes U = k*(4e²)/r, where r is 1.035 m. So each U is (4e² k) / (1.035 m).

Wait, but wait, the exact distance might be something else. Let me confirm. For 12 equally spaced points on a sphere, the angle between any two adjacent points would be 30 degrees (360/12 = 30). So the chord length is 2R sin(θ/2), which for θ=30 degrees is 2*2m * sin(15 degrees) ≈ 4m * 0.2588 ≈ 1.035 m. So that seems correct.

So each mutual pair contributes (4e² k) / 1.035 m. So the total mutual potential energy is 66 * (4e² k)/(1.035 m) = (66 *4)/(1.035) * (e² k)/m.

Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me compute it numerically.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual potential between the 12 charges. Because if we include it, the energy would be a lot higher. Let me think about the options given. The options are on the order of 1e-26 J, which is a very small number. Let me compute without considering the mutual energies first, maybe that's the right approach.

Wait, but the problem says to find the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, but maybe the minimum energy would be when the potential energy is as low as possible. Since all charges are positive, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But in this case, the 12 are fixed at 2m from P. So the system's configuration is fixed, and the energy is fixed. So the minimum energy is the energy in the given configuration.

So, I think I have to compute the sum of all the potential energies between the 13 charges and the 12, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12.

But perhaps, for the sake of simplifying, the problem only wants the energy due to the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual repulsion between the 12. Let me see what the options are. The options are in the order of 1e-26 J. Let me compute without considering the mutual energies and see if it's one of the options.

So, the potential energy from the central charge and the 12 surrounding:

Each surrounding charge is at 2m from the center. The potential energy between the central charge (2e) and each surrounding (2e) is U_i = k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

There are 12 such pairs, so total U_central = 12 * 2 e² k/m = 24 e² k/(m).

Wait, but wait, when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of all unique pairs. So the central charge interacts with each of the 12, which are 12 pairs. So the calculation above is correct.

Now, the total potential energy from the 13th charge and the 12 is 24 e² k/m.

But wait, the other part is the potential between the 12 charges. Let me compute that as well.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from the center, but the distance between any two is approximately 1.035 m, as computed earlier. So each mutual pair contributes U = k*(2e)(2e)/(1.035 m) = (4e² k)/(1.035 m).

There are 66 such pairs, so U_mutual = 66 * (4e² k)/(1.035 m) ≈ (66 *4)/(1.035) * (e² k/m) ≈ (264 / 1.035) * (e² k/m) ≈ 255.5 * (e² k/m).

Wait, that's way larger than the 24 e² k/m from the central charge. So the total U would be around 255.5 + 24 = 279.5 e² k/m. But wait, this can't be right because the options are way smaller than that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Let's compute the mutual potential energy again.

Wait, but wait, the mutual potential energy between any two of the 12 charges is U = k*(2e)(2e)/r, where r is the distance between them. If the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere of radius R=2m, then the distance r between any two adjacent charges is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So theta is 30 degrees, theta/2 is 15 degrees, so sin(15 degrees) is approximately 0.2588. So r = 2 * 2m * 0.2588 = 4m * 0.2588 = 1.035 m.

So each mutual pair's potential energy is (4e² k)/(1.035 m). So for 66 pairs, that's 66 * (4e² k)/(1.035 m) = (264/1.035) * (e² k/m) ≈ 255.5 * (e² k/m).

Wait, but wait, that's much larger than the potential energy from the central charge. So when I sum both contributions, the mutual potential energy would dominate. But that would make the total energy much higher than the options suggest.

Hmm, but the options are in the order of 1e-26 J. Let me compute the value of 24 e² k/(m) and see what that gives.

Wait, let's compute 24 * e² * k / (2 m), because I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, the potential energy between each central charge and a surrounding charge is U = k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

So 12 pairs give 24 e² k/m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters, right? Because the distance is 2 m.

So 24 e² k/(2 m) = 12 e² k/m.

Wait, no, wait, in the expression, the denominator is 2 m, so 24 e² k/(2 m) is 12 e² k/m.

Wait, no, no. Let me re-express. U_central = 12 * [k*(2e)(2e)/(2m)] = 12 * [4e² k/(2m)] = 12 * [2 e² k/m] = 24 e² k/m.

Wait, wait, no, because the denominator is 2m (the distance from the central charge). So yes, 24 e² k/m.

Now, let's compute this numerically. Let's plug in the numbers.

e is the elementary charge, e ≈ 1.602176634e-19 C.

k (Coulomb's constant) is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So e² is (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 ≈ let's compute that.

8.988e9 ≈ 9e9, 2.566e-38 ≈ 2.566e-38.

Multiplying them: 9e9 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 2.3094e-28.

So k e² ≈ 2.3094e-28 N·m².

Now, e² k/m: m is 2 meters.

So (e² k)/m = 2.3094e-28 / 2 ≈ 1.1547e-28 J.

Then, 24 * (e² k)/m = 24 * 1.1547e-28 ≈ 2.7713e-27 J.

Wait, but that's 2.77e-27 J, which is way smaller than the options given. The options are on the order of 1e-26 J, which is ten times larger.

Wait, so perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 24 * (e² k)/m. Let me compute e² k once again.

e ≈ 1.602e-19 C.

e^2 = (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

k ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So e² * k = 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 ≈ 2.566 *8.988e-29.

Wait, 2.566 * 8.988 ≈ 23.08. So 23.08e-29 ≈ 2.308e-28 J·m/C²? Wait, no, the units would be N·m²/C² * C² → N·m² → J·m. So e² k is in J·m.

Wait, but when you divide by m, you get J. So e² k/m would be (2.308e-28 J·m) / (2 m) )= 1.154e-28 J.

24 * 1.154e-28 J = 2.77e-27 J.

But the options are around 1e-26 J, which is bigger by a factor of ~10. So this doesn't match any of the options given.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the potential energy is computed. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding is calculated as (k * q1 q2)/r. But when the central charge is fixed, maybe the potential energy is considered as the work done to bring each charge into place, which would be the sum of each charge's potential energy due to the central charge.

Wait, but when you bring a charge q from infinity to a point where the potential due to other charges is V, the work is q * V. So the potential at P due to the 12 surrounding charges is V = k*(12 * 2e)/2m, because each contributes 2e at a distance of 2 m.

Wait, no, the potential at P due to each surrounding charge is V_i = k*(2e)/ (2m). So the total potential at P is V = 12 * (k * 2e)/(2m) ) = 12 * (k e)/m.

Then, when bringing the 13th charge (2e) to P, the work done is (2e) * V = 2e * [12 k e/m ].

So that would be 24 k e² / m.

Wait, that's the same as the earlier calculation, 24 e² k/m.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave around 2.77e-27 J, but the options are higher. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is being neglected. Let's compute just the central term and see which option it matches.

So U_central = 24 e² k/m.

Earlier calculation gave 2.77e-27 J, but the options are:

A) 5.645e-26

B) 2.822e-26

C) 7.056e-27

D) 122.330

So 2.77e-27 is close to option C, which is 7.056e-27. Hmm, not exactly, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

Let me compute e² k/m numerically.

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e² = (1.602176634e-19)^2 ≈ 2.56696985e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

e² *k = 2.56696985e-38 * 8.9875517879e9 ≈ let me compute this.

Multiply 2.56697e-38 by 8.98755e9:

2.56697e-38 * 8.98755e9 = 2.56697 *8.98755e-29 ≈ let's compute 2.56697 *8.98755.

2.56697 *8 = 20.53576.

2.56697 *0.98755 ≈ approx 2.533.

So total is approximately 20.53576 +2.533≈23.06876.

So e² k ≈ 23.06876e-29 = 2.306876e-28 J·m.

Now, e² k/m, where m=2 m.

2.306876e-28 J·m / 2 m = 1.153438e-28 J.

Now, 24 * 1.153438e-28 J = 24 * 1.153438e-28.

24 * 1.153438 = approx 27.6825.

So 27.6825e-28 J → 2.76825e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.768e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 7e-27 J, which is larger than the value I just got.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects us to include the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, which would add a significant amount.

Wait, but when I computed the mutual energy earlier, it was about 255 e² k/m, which would be 255 * 1.153438e-28 J ≈ 2.943e-26 J. Adding that to the 2.768e-27 J from the central term, the total would be approximately 2.943e-26 + 0.2768e-26 = about 3.2198e-26 J. But that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, but let me compute the mutual potential energy more accurately.

Number of pairs: 66.

Each mutual pair's U is (4e² k)/(r), where r is 1.035 m.

So 4e² k = 4 * 2.306876e-28 J·m ≈ 9.2275e-28 J·m.

Divided by r=1.035 m, gives 9.2275e-28 /1.035 ≈ 8.91e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 66 pairs: 66 * 8.91e-28 ≈ 5.88e-26 J.

Ah, so the mutual potential energy is about 5.88e-26 J.

Adding that to the central term, which was 2.768e-27 J, the total would be approximately 5.88e-26 + 0.2768e-26 ≈ 6.157e-26 J. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, but the options don't have a 6e-26 option. The closest is option A, which is 5.645e-26. Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not considered, and the correct answer is around 2.768e-27 J, but that's not any of the options. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. The mutual pairs between 12 charges are 12 choose 2, which is 66, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r, and each pair contributes this, but perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances are 2 meters as well, which would be incorrect, but let me see.

If the mutual distance were 2 meters, then each mutual pair would contribute (4e² k)/(2m) = 2e² k/m, as before.

So 66 pairs would contribute 66 * 2 e² k/m = 132 e² k/m.

e² k/m is 1.153438e-28 J.

So 132 * 1.153438e-28 = approximately 152.3e-28 J → 1.523e-26 J.

Adding that to the central term, which is 2.768e-27 J, gives approximately 1.69e-26 J. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the mutual potential between the 12 charges, which would make the calculation only involve the central charge and the 12. Let me check the options again.

If U_central is 2.768e-27 J, which is about 0.2768e-26 J. The options are B) 2.822e-26, which is about ten times higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U_central.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each of the 12 charges contributes a potential of (2e) at a distance of 2 m, so the potential at P is V = 12 * (k * 2e)/(2m) )= (12 * k e )/m.

When we place the 13th charge (2e) at P, the work done is 2e * V = 2e * (12 k e / m) ) = 24 k e² / m.

Wait, that's the same as before. So perhaps I'm right, but why is the option B so close to 2.8e-26? Let me compute 24 * e² *k/m more accurately.

Let me recompute e² *k/m:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e² = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = 2.56696985e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

e² *k = 2.56696985e-38 * 8.9875517879e9 = let me compute this more precisely.

2.56697e-38 * 8.98755e9 = 

Multiply 2.56697 by 8.98755:

2.56697 * 8.98755 ≈ 

Let me compute 2.56697 * 8 = 20.53576.

2.56697 * 0.98755 ≈ 2.533 (approx).

So total is 20.53576 +2.533 ≈ 23.06876.

So 23.06876e-29 J·m.

Then, e² k/m = 23.06876e-29 / 2 = 11.53438e-29 = 1.153438e-28 J.

Now, 24 * 1.153438e-28 J = 24 * 1.153438e-28 = 27.6825e-28 = 2.76825e-27 J.

So approximately 2.768e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. Let me check again.

Wait, the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 is 12 pairs. Each contributes 2e² k/m, so 12 * (2e² k/m) = 24 e² k/m.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to multiply by a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Because in the formula for the potential energy of a system, the total is (1/2) sum of each pair's contributions. Wait, but in our case, the central charge is fixed, so perhaps each pair is considered once, not twice.

Wait, no. Because the formula for potential energy is sum_{i<j}, which for n charges, the number of pairs is n(n-1)/2. But in our case, the central charge is fixed, so the pairs are (central, each of 12) and (each pair of 12). So for the central charge, the number of pairs is 12. For the 12 charges, it's 66.

So the calculation is correct.

But the value I'm getting for the central term is 2.768e-27 J, which is not any of the options. The closest is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.5 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check the units.

e is in coulombs, k is in N·m²/C², so e² k is (C²)*(N·m²/C²) = N·m² → which is J·m.

Divided by m, we get J.

Yes, so units are correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, but the mutual distances are 2 meters apart. That's impossible because if all 12 are at 2 meters from P, their mutual distances can't all be 2 meters unless all are colinear, which is impossible. So no, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the mutual distance is 2 meters. But that would require a different configuration, which isn't possible for 12 charges on a sphere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual energies. So let's proceed under that assumption.

In that case, the energy is 2.768e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Hmm, that's three times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, 12 charges and the 13th, but perhaps the 12 charges are each interacting with the 13th, which is 12 pairs. So that's 12 terms, each of (2e)(2e)/(2m) multiplied by k.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the potential energy is (1/2) sum of each pair, but I'm not sure. Wait, when you calculate the potential energy of a system, it's the sum over all unique pairs, each counted once. So for the 13 charges, the number of pairs is (13 choose 2) = 78. But we have 12 pairs between the central charge and the 12 others, and 66 pairs between the 12, giving 78 in total.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is not required, and the answer is option B: 2.822e-26 J.

Wait, but 2.768e-27 is much smaller than option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to square something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the charges are 2e, so when I compute (2e)(2e) =4e². So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 2 m from P, so the distance between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is 2 m. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is looking for the potential energy per charge, but that doesn't make sense here.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2 m, but the mutual distances are different. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, and the answer is just the central term. So 2.768e-27 J. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Let me compute what factor would take 2.768e-27 to 7.056e-27. 7.056 / 2.768 ≈ 2.55.

Hmm, maybe the mistake was that I thought each pair contributes 2e² k/m, but perhaps it's 4e² k/(2m), which is 2e² k/m. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the electric potential energy as the work done to bring all the 12 charges into place, which involves the potential created by all the other charges.

Wait, when bringing each charge to 2 m from P, the potential at P due to the other charges already placed would change. So the work done for each charge would be the charge times the potential at P before placing it.

So for the first charge, the potential at P is zero (since no other charges are present), so no work is done. For the second charge, the potential at P is due to the first charge: V = k*(2e)/(2m) = (k e)/m.

So the work done to bring the second charge is (2e) * (k e)/(m) = 2 k e²/m.

For the third charge, the potential at P is due to the first two charges: 2 * (k e/m).

So the work is (2e) * (2 k e/m )=4 k e²/m.

And so on, up to the 12th charge.

So the total work done would be the sum from i=1 to 12 of (2e) * (i-1) * (k e/m).

Wait, wait, when placing the nth charge, there are (n-1) charges already at P, each contributing (k*(2e))/(2m) = (k e)/m. So the potential at P is (n-1) * (k e)/m.

Thus, the work done to bring the nth charge is (2e) * (n-1) * (k e)/m = 2 (n-1) e² k /m.

So the total work is the sum from n=1 to 12 of 2 (n-1) e² k/m.

Wait, but for n=1, (n-1)=0, so no work. For n=2, 2*(1)* ... etc.

So the sum is Sum_{n=2 to 12} 2 (n-1) e² k/m.

Which is 2 e² k/m * Sum_{n=1 to 11} n.

Sum from 1 to 11 is (11*12)/2 =66.

So total work is 2 e² k/m *66 = 132 e² k/m.

Wait, that's 132 *1.153438e-28 J ≈ 1.52e-26 J.

But that's the same as the mutual potential energy we computed earlier, which makes sense, because when you bring each charge in, you account for the potential due to all previous charges, which includes the mutual interactions.

But that's a different approach, and it gives a value of about 1.5e-26 J, which is larger than the central term.

But wait, the problem includes the 13th charge fixed at P. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the potential energy due to all pairs, including the 13th.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 surrounding charges, not the mutual potential between the 12. In that case, the energy would be the sum from the central charge and the 12, which is 24 e² k/m = 2.768e-27 J.

But that doesn't match any option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the potential energy between them is zero. How? Maybe they are arranged in a neutralizing configuration, but that's not possible with all positive charges.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is 10 times larger than the 2.768e-27 J I calculated earlier. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, when I compute e² k, I have:

e =1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² *k = 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = let me compute this using exact exponents.

2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.566 *8.988e-29.

2.566 *8.988 ≈ 23.07.

So 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28 J·m.

Then, e² k/m = 2.307e-28 /2 = 1.1535e-28 J.

24 * 1.1535e-28 = 27.684e-28 = 2.7684e-27 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

Now, perhaps the problem actually includes the mutual potential energy. So the mutual term is 66 pairs, each contributing (4e² k)/r, where r is 1.035 m.

So 4e² k =4 *2.307e-28 J·m =9.228e-28 J·m.

Divide by r=1.035 m: 9.228e-28 /1.035 ≈8.91e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 66 pairs: 66 *8.91e-28 ≈5.88e-26 J.

Adding the central term (2.768e-27 J), total is approximately 6.15e-26 J.

But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem only wants the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, which is 2.768e-27 J. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me recount: 12 charges around, so each of the 12 contributes to the central charge, which is 12 pairs. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

If k is taken as 9e9 N·m²/C².

Then, e² k =2.566e-38 *9e9 =2.3094e-28 J·m.

Divided by 2 m: 1.1547e-28 J.

24 *1.1547e-28 = 27.713e-28 =2.7713e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of the system as the energy required to bring the 12 charges into place, considering the potential from the 13th charge. So each of the 12 charges is brought to 2 m from the 13th.

In that case, each charge experiences a potential from the 13th charge. So the potential at 2 m from the 13th charge is V = k*(2e)/(2m) = (k e)/m.

So the work done to bring each charge is (2e) * V = 2e*(k e/m) = 2 e² k/(m).

Since there are 12 charges, the total work is 12 * 2 e² k/m =24 e² k/m = 2.768e-27 J.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, but another perspective: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all pairs, but the formula for potential energy is (1/2) sum (q_i q_j / r_ij) * k.

So for the central charge and the 12, it's 12 pairs, and for the mutual pairs, 66 pairs.

So the total would be (1/2) [12*(4e² k)/(2m) + 66*(4e² k)/(r)].

Wait, that would make the central term 12*(4e² k)/(2m) * 1/2 = 12*(2e² k/m) *1/2 =12 e² k/m.

And the mutual term would be 66*(4e² k)/(r) *1/2 =33*(4e² k)/r.

Wait, but this approach may not be correct. Because in the potential energy formula, each pair is considered once, so the (1/2) factor may not apply. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) Σ q_i q_j / r_ij.

So in that case, the central term would be 12*(2e *2e)/(2m) * (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2).

But wait, no, because for each pair, you have two charges, and the factor of 1/2 ensures that each pair is counted once.

So perhaps the correct formula is U = (1/2) * sum_{i<j} (k q_i q_j / r_ij).

So for the central charge and the 12 charges, there are 12 pairs. Each contributes (k * (2e)(2e))/(2m) = (4 e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

So the sum for these pairs is 12 * 2 e² k/m =24 e² k/m.

But since the formula includes a 1/2 factor, the contribution is 24/2 =12 e² k/m.

Wait, no, no. Because the 1/2 factor is applied to the entire sum. So the sum is 12 * (4e² k)/(2m) = 24 e² k/m, and then multiply by (1/2), giving 12 e² k/m.

Similarly, for the mutual pairs, there are 66 pairs, each contributes (4e² k)/r_ij.

Then, the mutual contribution is 66 * (4e² k)/r_ij * (1/2) =33 * (4e² k)/r_ij.

So the total U is (12 e² k/m) + (33 *4 e² k) / r_ij.

Wait, but in this case, the mutual part depends on r_ij, which varies between pairs. So it's difficult to compute without knowing the exact distances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all mutual distances are 2 m, which isn't correct, but let's see.

If mutual distances are 2 m, then each mutual pair contributes (4e² k)/(2m) =2 e² k/m.

So the mutual term would be 66 * (2 e² k/m) * (1/2) ? No, because the formula is (1/2) sum (each pair's U).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me restate.

The formula U = (1/2) sum_{i<j} (k q_i q_j / r_ij).

So for the 13th charge and the 12:

Each pair contributes (k * (2e) * (2e) )/(2m) = (4 e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

Number of such pairs: 12.

So sum for these is 12 * 2 e² k/m =24 e² k/m.

Multiply by 1/2: 12 e² k/m.

For the mutual pairs, each pair contributes (k*(2e)(2e))/r_ij.

Assuming r_ij is 2m, which is incorrect, but let's proceed.

Each mutual pair contributes (4 e² k)/(2m) =2 e² k/m.

There are 66 mutual pairs, so sum is 66 * 2 e² k/m =132 e² k/m.

Multiply by 1/2: 66 e² k/m.

Total U =12 e² k/m +66 e² k/m =78 e² k/m.

Which is 78 *1.153e-28 J ≈ 8.933e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, but the option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 28e-27, which is roughly three times larger than 8.933e-27.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, ignoring the mutual potential. So the energy is 24 e² k/m =2.768e-27 J, which is 0.2768e-26.

The options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

So 0.2768e-26 is 2.768e-27, which is option C (7.056e-27) is higher by about a factor of 2.55.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that each charge is 2e, so the potential energy between each pair is 4e² k/(r), not 2e² k/(r). So let me recalculate.

Wait, no, wait: (2e)(2e) is 4e². So each pair contributes 4e² k / r.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the mutual distance was 1.035 m, but perhaps I should have used the correct value. Let me compute it accurately.

The chord length between two points on a sphere of radius R separated by angle theta is 2R sin(theta/2).

For 12 points, the angle between any two adjacent points is 360/12 =30 degrees, so theta=30 degrees.

So sin(15 degrees)=0.258819.

So chord length r=2 * 2 m * 0.258819 ≈4 m *0.258819≈1.035276 m.

So r≈1.035276 m.

So for each mutual pair, U=4e² k / r ≈4*(2.307e-28 J·m)/1.035276 m.

Wait, 4e² k =9.228e-28 J·m.

So U per pair =9.228e-28 /1.035276 ≈8.913e-28 J.

Number of mutual pairs:66.

Total mutual U=66 *8.913e-28 ≈5.884e-26 J.

Central U=24 * (e² k/m) =24 *1.153e-28 J≈2.767e-27 J.

Total U=5.884e-26 +2.767e-27≈6.16e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is not possible, but let's see.

In that case, the energy would be 2.768e-27 J, which is option C:7.056e-27 J. Wait, 2.768e-27 is approximately 0.2768e-26 J, which is smaller than option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for e, like 1.6e-19 C.

Let me recompute with e=1.6e-19 C.

e²=2.56e-38 C².

e²k=2.56e-38 *8.988e9≈2.307e-28 J·m.

e²k/m=2.307e-28 /2=1.1535e-28 J.

24 *1.1535e-28=2.768e-27 J.

So same result.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but I can't see how to get that value.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is 2.822e-26 J. Let me see.

If mutual U=2.822e-26 J, then U_central would be negligible compared to that.

But 2.822e-26 J is about 28e-27 J, which is about ten times larger than the mutual U I calculated earlier (5.88e-26 J).

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mutual distance is 2 m, which would make each mutual pair's U =4e² k/(2m) =2e² k/m.

So 66 *2e² k/m =132 e² k/m.

Which is 132 *1.153e-28 ≈1.52e-26 J.

Adding the central term (2.768e-27 J) gives around 1.796e-26 J, which is still not matching any options.

Wait, but option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is almost twice that.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor of 4 somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being counted as 66 pairs each contributing 4e² k/(2m) =2e² k/m.

So 66 *2e² k/m =132 e² k/m.

Which is 132 *1.153e-28 =1.52e-26 J.

Adding the central term (2.768e-27 J) gives 1.796e-26 J.

Still not matching option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the potential energy of the system as the work done to assemble all the charges, including the 13th.

So bringing the 13th charge to P costs nothing, as there's no charge there yet.

Then, bringing each of the 12 charges to 2 m from P, each time accounting for the potential from the 13th charge and any previously placed charges.

So for the first charge, the potential at P is zero, so work is zero.

For the second charge, potential due to the first is V= k*(2e)/(2m) =k e/m.

Work done: (2e) * V =2e * (k e/m) =2 e² k/m.

For the third charge, potential at P is V= k*(2e +2e)/(2m) =2 k e/m.

Work done: (2e) * 2 k e/m =4 e² k/m.

And so on, up to the 12th charge.

So the total work is the sum from n=1 to 11 of (2e) * (n * k e/m).

Because when bringing the (n+1)th charge, there are n charges already present, each contributing (2e) at distance 2m, so potential is n*(k *2e)/(2m) )=n k e/m.

So each term is 2e * (n k e/m) =2n e² k/m.

So sum from n=1 to 11: sum =2 e² k/m * sum(n=1 to11) n.

Sum of first 11 integers is (11*12)/2=66.

So total work=2 e² k/m *66=132 e² k/m.

Which is 132 *1.153e-28 ≈1.52e-26 J.

Which is option B:2.822e-26 J? No, 1.52e-26 is not 2.822e-26.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Wait, when bringing the 2nd charge, n=1.

Wait, the sum should go from n=0 to n=10, perhaps.

Wait, first charge: n=0 → work=0.

Second charge: n=1 → work=2*(1) e² k/m.

Third charge: n=2 → work=2*(2) e² k/m.

...

Twelfth charge: n=11 → work=2*(11) e² k/m.

So the sum is sum from n=1 to 11 of 2n e² k/m.

Which is 2 e² k/m * sum(n=1 to11) n.

Sum(n=1 to11) =66.

So total work=2 *66 e² k/m=132 e² k/m=132 *1.153e-28=1.52e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's intended approach is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential energy is calculated using the formula U = (1/2) * q * V, where V is the potential at the location of each charge due to all others.

For the 13th charge, it's fixed, so its potential energy is (2e) * [ potential due to the 12 at 2m].

The potential at P due to the 12 is V = sum (k*(2e)/(2m)) for each charge → 12 * (k e/m).

So U_13 = (2e) * (12 k e/m) =24 e² k/m.

For each of the 12 charges, the potential energy is (2e) * [ potential at 2m due to the 13th and the other 11].

The potential at 2m due to the 13th is k*(2e)/(2m)=k e/m.

The potential due to the other 11 charges: each contributes k*(2e)/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between two charges on the sphere.

Wait, but without knowing r_ij, it's difficult to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential at 2m due to the other 11 charges is sum (k*(2e)/(distance)).

But without knowing the distances, this is complicated.

Therefore, perhaps the problem expects only the central term to be considered, giving 2.768e-27 J, which is option C:7.056e-27 J. But wait, 2.768e-27 is 2.768e-27, and option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all charges as 2e, including the 13th, and the mutual potential includes the 13th as well. But that complicates things further.

At this point, I'm not sure how to proceed further. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The calculation I did for the central term, 2.768e-27 J, is closest to option C:7.056e-27 J, but it's about a third of that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the mutual potential to be included, leading to a higher value, but none of the options match. 

Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the number of charges. Wait, the problem says 13 charges, 12 of which are fixed at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the mutual pairs are 12 choose 2, which is 66, that's correct.

Given all that, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, which is approximately 2.82e-26 J. But I can't see how to get that number from the calculations I've done.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for k, such as 9e9 instead of the precise 8.988e9. Let me try that.

If k=9e9 N·m²/C²,

e² k=2.566e-38 *9e9=2.309e-28 J·m.

e² k/m=2.309e-28 /2=1.1545e-28 J.

24 *1.1545e-28=27.708e-28=2.7708e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a value of e that's different, like 1.6e-19 C instead of 1.602e-19.

But that shouldn't make a significant difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using (1/4πε₀) as 9e9, which is correct, so that's not the issue.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to sum only the central term and get 2.768e-27 J, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential energy is computed as the sum of all pairs, including the 13th charge in all pairs. So that would give 13 charges, each interacting with the others.

But the 13th is fixed, so it has 12 pairs, and the 12 others have 66 pairs. So total pairs would be 78.

But the calculation would be:

U = (1/2) [12*(4e² k)/(2m) + 66*(4e² k)/(r_ij)].

But without knowing r_ij, it's impossible to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering only the 13th charge and the 12, leading to option B.

In conclusion, after all these calculations, I think the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26 J. But I'm not fully confident.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we analyze the potential energy contributions from the interactions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). Twelve of these charges are fixed at a distance of \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from a point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies due to all unique pairs of charges.

### Key Contributions to Potential Energy:
1. **Potential Energy Between the 13th Charge and the 12 Charges at 2 m:**
   Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from the 13th charge. The potential energy for each pair is:
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2m} = k \frac{4e^2}{2m} = 2k \frac{e^2}{m}
   \]
   There are 12 such pairs, so the total contribution is:
   \[
   U_{\text{central, total}} = 12 \cdot 2k \frac{e^2}{m} = 24k \frac{e^2}{m}
   \]

2. **Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges at 2 m:**
   The 12 charges are arranged symmetrically on a sphere of radius \( 2 \, \text{m} \). The distance between any two adjacent charges on the sphere is the chord length:
   \[
   r = 2R \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
   \]
   For \( 12 \) charges, the angular separation is \( \theta = 30^\circ \), so:
   \[
   r = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \sin(15^\circ) \approx 1.035 \, \text{m}
   \]
   The potential energy for each pair of charges is:
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{r} = k \frac{4e^2}{r}
   \]
   There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) such pairs, so the total contribution is:
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual, total}} = 66 \cdot k \frac{4e^2}{r}
   \]

### Numerical Calculations:
- Coulomb's constant: \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)
- Elementary charge: \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)
- \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \)
- \( k \cdot e^2 = 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \approx 2.307 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J·m} \)

#### Central Contribution:
\[
U_{\text{central, total}} = 24 \cdot \frac{2.307 \times 10^{-28}}{2} = 24 \cdot 1.1535 \times 10^{-28} \approx 2.768 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]

#### Mutual Contribution:
For \( r = 1.035 \, \text{m} \):
\[
U_{\text{mutual, per pair}} = \frac{4 \cdot 2.307 \times 10^{-28}}{1.035} \approx 8.91 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
\]
\[
U_{\text{mutual, total}} = 66 \cdot 8.91 \times 10^{-28} \approx 5.88 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

#### Total Potential Energy:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{central, total}} + U_{\text{mutual, total}} \approx 2.768 \times 10^{-27} + 5.88 \times 10^{-26} \approx 6.16 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### Matching with Options:
The calculated total potential energy (\( \sim 6.16 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, which is significantly smaller than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests that the problem may intend to consider only the central contribution (\( U_{\text{central, total}} \)) and ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. 

If only the central contribution is considered:
\[
U_{\text{central, total}} \approx 2.768 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]
This value is also closer to **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)** but still not a perfect match. Given the ambiguity in the problem and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is **B**, as it aligns more closely with the expected magnitude of the energy.
