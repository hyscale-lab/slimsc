Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to work through this.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, right. So first, the relative speed. I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula is needed here. The formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects as observed from the same frame.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So which one is u and which is v? The problem says the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c. Oh, but wait, if they are moving in the same direction, then their relative speed is the difference between their speeds. Because from the perspective of one astronaut, the other is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c? But wait, no, that's not correct because of relativity.

No, wait, that's only in classical mechanics. For relativistic speeds, we need to use the formula. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, wait, the problem says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." Oh, wait, the relative speed is the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So, let's say we need to find the speed of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A's frame.

So, u is 0.5c (B's speed) and v is 0.6c (A's speed, but wait no). No, wait, the velocity addition formula is when you have two frames moving relative to each other. If A is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, and B is moving at u relative to the lab frame, then the speed of B in A's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²).

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. Let me get this straight. The lab frame is the rest frame where both astronauts are moving. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So in the lab frame, A is faster than B.

But the question is about their relative speed. So from A's perspective, what speed is B moving at? So in A's frame, B is approaching (or receding?) at a certain speed.

Wait, no. If both are moving in the same direction, then in A's frame, B would appear to be moving at a slower speed relative to A. So u (B's speed in lab) is 0.5c, and v (A's speed in lab) is 0.6c. So the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - u v /c² ).

But wait, wait, if I'm using the formula to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame, then u is the speed of B in the lab (0.5c), and v is the speed of A in the lab (0.6c). So substituting, (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A. But since both are moving in the positive x-direction, if A is moving faster, then B would appear to be moving backward relative to A. So the relative speed's magnitude would be 0.1c/(denominator).

Denominator: 1 - (0.5 * 0.6)c² / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.1428c. The negative indicates direction, but the question is about speed, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c^2, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So each astronaut's energy is their rest mass multiplied by their gamma factor.

Astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = 2m * gamma1 c² = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no wait. Oh, no. Wait, the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So for each, E = gamma * m c². So for astronaut 1, it's 2m * (gamma1 c²) ?

Wait, no, let me think again. The rest mass
