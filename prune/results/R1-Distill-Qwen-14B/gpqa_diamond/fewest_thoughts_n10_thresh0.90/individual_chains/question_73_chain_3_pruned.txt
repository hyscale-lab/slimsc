Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity formulas.

Let me read the question again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so they're moving in the same direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, the relative speed. I think the formula for adding velocities in relativity is different from the classical addition. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects as observed from the same frame. Wait, but wait, since both are moving in the same direction, which one is u and which is v? Let me think. If the first astronaut is at 0.6c and the second at 0.5c, then the relative speed of the second as seen by the first would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, no. Wait, the formula is when you have two velocities, u and v, as observed from the same frame. The relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at a speed v', which is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Wait, no, that's not right. Because relative velocity isn't that straightforward. Let me think again.

Wait, if the first astronaut is moving at u = 0.6c relative to the lab frame, and the second is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction, as observed from the lab frame. So, to find the speed of the second as seen from the first's frame (u'), we can use the velocity addition formula. So u' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the velocity addition formula is when you have an object moving at velocity v in the lab frame, and you want its velocity in a frame moving at velocity u relative to the lab. The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). So in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c (u = 0.6c), and the second is moving at v = 0.5c. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would be (-0.1c) / (1 - (0.3c²
