Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

So, the setup is that there's a star similar to the Sun but a bit biggerâ€”radius 1.5 times the Sun's. There are two planets orbiting this star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's in a circular orbit. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. Now, they want to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii in size. This second planet is also in a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the first planet. The key here is that both transit and occultation events must occur. 

Wait, what's a transit and an occultation? Oh right, a transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we lose the planet's light (if it's reflecting or emitting, like if it's a moon or something). But for this problem, I think the important part is that the second planet must both transit and be occulted, meaning that both events are observable. 

So, the question is about the maximum period the second planet can have while still allowing these two events. Hmm. I remember that for a transit to happen, the planet must pass in front of the star. For occultation, it must pass behind. So the alignment of the orbits probably matters in terms of their orbital speeds and periods. 

Wait, but both planets are in the same orbital plane, so their orbital planes are aligned. But since they have different orbital periods, their orbital speeds are different. The transit and occultation events happen when the planets are aligned with the star from our perspective. So, the second planet's orbital period must be such that it can catch up or overtake the first planet in such a way that their alignments occur. 

Wait, no. Let's think again. The transit and occultation events are when the planet is in a line with the star. For the second planet to both transit and occult, it must be possible for it to be in the same line as the star from our point of view at some point in their orbits. 

Wait, but the first planet is already transiting. The second planet needs to also transit. But for
