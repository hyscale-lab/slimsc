Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because the star is rotating, these spots will cause brightness variations that look like those from a planet transiting the star. The question is asking what planet radius would produce the same signal as these spots, assuming no spots existed otherwise.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. But wait, this might not be the same case because the spots are dark and cause a dip in brightness when they rotate into view.

Wait, no, wait. When the spots are on the star, the observed brightness from Earth (or wherever we're observing from) would vary as the star rotates. The spots would block some of the star's light when they're facing us, causing a dip. Similarly, a planet transiting in front would also block some light, causing a dip. So the question is, what planet size would cause the same dip amplitude as the spots.

But wait, the star's spots are dark. So when the star rotates and the spot comes into view, the amount of light we receive decreases. But the star's brightness is due to its entire surface emitting light. So the spots have a lower temperature, so each spot emits less light than the surrounding area. So when the spots are on the visible side, the total brightness is a bit less.

But the problem says, what exoplanet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spot-induced variations. So we need to compute the fractional change in brightness for both cases and set them equal.

Let me think about how to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots.

First, the star's total flux without any spots is what? Well, the flux from a star is proportional to its surface area multiplied by the flux per unit area. Flux per unit area (like from a blackbody) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: sigma * T^4. So the star's total flux is sigma * Teff^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2.

But when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler. The filling factor is given as 20%, but wait, it's for one hemisphere. So hemisphere has 20% spots. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) ), because the hemisphere is a sphere with 2 pi steradians. But wait, does the filling factor account for the entire spot area? Or is it just one hemisphere?

Wait, the question says: one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So each hemisphere (Northern and Southern, perhaps) but only one is spotty. Wait, no, the question says "one hemisphere" is covered. So only one hemisphere (like the front half) is spotty, covering 20% of that hemisphere's surface.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface area (of the hemisphere) covered by spots. So for the hemisphere, the area is 2 pi R^2. The spot area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4 pi R^2. So the spot area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2. So the total spot area is 0.4 pi R^2. Or is it 0.2 * (hemisphere's surface area) = 0.2*(2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2? Yes, that's correct.

Now, each
