Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. Hmm, I remember that particles can decay into other particles if certain conditions are met. Let me try to think through this.

The question is about the boson X, which has a mass of 6 GeV. I need to find out which particles it can decay into at the lowest order. The Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure how important that is right now. Maybe it tells me about the interactions, but perhaps for the decay options, the main thing is the mass and the allowed decay products based on energy.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_bar f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, this looks like a Yukawa interaction term. So the boson X couples to fermions. The fermion field ψ_f probably represents some type of fermion, like quarks or leptons.

But for decay, the key point is conservation laws and whether the energy is sufficient. X is a boson, so it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because bosons can annihilate into pairs of particles. But each fermion has a rest mass, so the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to the mass of X for the decay to be possible.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to list all possible fermion pairs that have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's think about the masses of the known fermions. Quarks come in different flavors, but their masses vary. For example, up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are about a few MeV. The strange quark is heavier, maybe around 100 MeV. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, bottom is around 5 GeV, and top is way heavier, like 173 GeV. But since X is 6 GeV, top quarks are out of the question because each top is 173 GeV, so two would be 346 GeV, way more than 6.

Wait, but wait. The mass of the quark is per particle. So for a pair, it's 2 * mass. So for each quark, I need to see if 2 * mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So let's list the fermion masses:

Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV (so 2m is ~0.001 GeV)
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV (so 2m is ~0.21 GeV)
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV (so 2m is ~3.55 GeV)

Quarks:
- Up: ~2 MeV (so 2m ~4 MeV)
- Down: ~5 MeV (so ~10 MeV)
- Strange: ~100 MeV (so ~200 MeV)
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV (so ~3 GeV)
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV (so ~9 GeV)
- Top: way too heavy, as I thought.

Wait, but the bottom quark's mass is about 4.5 GeV each, so 2*4.5=9 GeV. That's more than X's 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because 9 GeV >6 GeV.

Charm is 3 GeV, so 2m is 3 GeV, which is less than 6. So c cbar is allowed.

Similarly, tau pairs: 2m is ~3.55 GeV, so that's allowed.

Wait, but wait, the decay must be to a pair. So the sum of the fermion and antifermion masses must be less than or equal to X's mass. So each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV? Because 2m must be <=6 GeV. So m <=3 GeV. So which fermions have mass less than 3 GeV?

Let's see:

Electron: way below. So e+ e- is allowed.

Muon: 0.105 GeV each, so 2 * 0.105=0.21 GeV. Allowed.

Tau: 1.777 GeV each, 2*1.777=3.554 GeV. 3.554 <6, so allowed.

Quarks:

Up: 2 MeV, so yes.

Down: 5 MeV, yes.

Strange: 100 MeV, yes.

Charm: 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is less than 6. So allowed.

Bottom: 4.5 GeV each, which is more than 3 GeV. So 2*4.5=9 GeV. 9>6, so not allowed.

Top: 173 GeV, way too big.

So possible fermions for decay are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but what about the quarks? The X boson can decay into quark-antiquark pairs if the quark mass allows it.

But wait, when considering decay products, it's possible for the boson to couple to any fermion pair as long as their combined mass is less than the boson's mass.

So, the possible decay channels are:

e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau-
u ubar
d dbar
s sbar
c cbar

Wait, but what about charm? Oh yes, as each is 1.5 GeV, 2*1.5=3 <=6.

So let me list all the possible options.

Looking at the choices:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

Wait, but b's mass is 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9>6. So decay into b bbar is not allowed. So option A includes b, which can't happen. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Wait, c cbar: 3 GeV, which is allowed. So that's okay. Does the X have enough mass to decay into a c cbar pair? Yes, because 3 GeV <6 GeV. So yes, but wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so 2m for c is 3 GeV, which is okay.

So option B has c cbar, which is allowed, but what about tau? Tau is 3.55 GeV, so that's allowed.

So option B includes c cbar, tau, mu, e, etc. So possible.

Option C: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Wait, t tbar: each is 173 GeV, 2*173=346 GeV. Way bigger than 6 GeV. So this option includes t tbar, which is impossible. So C is wrong.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Again, b is 4.5 GeV each, so 9 GeV. Not allowed. So D includes b, which is impossible. So D is incorrect.

So looking at the options, the correct decay channels should include c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

Which is option B. Because option B includes all the allowed fermion pairs except for b and t.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the mass of X is 6 GeV. For the c quark, each is 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is allowed. So decay into c cbar is possible.

But wait, I thought that for fermions, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. So for a pair, the total mass is 2m. So for X to decay into a pair, 2m <= m_X.

So for c cbar: 3 <=6 → allowed.

So option B includes c, which is allowed, and excludes b, which is not allowed. So option B is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option B:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Yes, all of these fermion pairs have 2m <=6 GeV.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decays are governed by energy conservation, requiring the combined mass of the decay products (a fermion-antifermion pair) to be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). The Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions via a Yukawa interaction, allowing decays into fermion-antifermion pairs.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**: For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the total mass of the pair, \( 2m \), must satisfy \( 2m \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This means each fermion's mass \( m \) must be \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - **Leptons**:
     - Electron (\( e \)): \( m \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m \approx 3.55 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - **Quarks**:
     - Up (\( u \)): \( m \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m \approx 4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - Down (\( d \)): \( m \approx 5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m \approx 10 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - Strange (\( s \)): \( m \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m \approx 200 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - Charm (\( c \)): \( m \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
     - Top (\( t \)): \( m \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

3. **Allowed Decays**: Based on the above, the allowed decays of \( X \) are:
   - \( X \to e^+ e^- \)
   - \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \)
   - \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \)
   - \( X \to u \bar{u} \)
   - \( X \to d \bar{d} \)
   - \( X \to s \bar{s} \)
   - \( X \to c \bar{c} \)

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are given in **Option B**.

Answer: B
