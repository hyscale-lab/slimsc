Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my interplanar distances. Let me try to think this through step by step. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal with specific parameters.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) for a crystal plane (hkl) can be calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor or the Bragg's law. The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a^2 cos^2 θ)

Wait, no, maybe that's when the angles aren't all equal. Oh wait, maybe I should think about the specific case of a rhombohedral system. In a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges are equal (a = b = c), and all the angles are equal (α = β = γ). So the formula might simplify.

I recall that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cosθ )

Wait, but wait, what's θ here? Because in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, but here they're 30 degrees. So the formula must account for the angles. Alternatively, the formula might be written in terms of the dot product of the vectors.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all angles α, β, γ are the same, so cos α = cos β = cos γ. Let's denote this common cosine as cosθ, where θ is 30 degrees in this case.

So substituting, the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ )

Which simplifies to:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cosθ (hk + hl + kl) )

In this problem, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. The interatomic distance a is given as 10 Angstrom. The angles are all 30 degrees, so cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Let me plug in the numbers.

First, compute the numerator h² + k² + l²: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Next, compute the 2 cosθ (hk + hl + kl). The terms hk, hl, kl are each 1*1=1, so their sum is 3. So 2 cosθ * 3 = 6 cosθ.

Now, putting it all into the denominator:

sqrt(3 - 6 cosθ )

Wait, but wait—that would be the denominator, so d is a / that sqrt.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the signs. The formula is (h² +k² +l²) - 2 cosθ (hk + hl + kl). So 3 - 6 cosθ.

So let's compute this.

Compute 3 - 6 * cos(30°). Cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 = 5.196.

3 - 5.196 = -2.196. Wait, that gives a negative number. Taking the square root of a negative number isn't possible, which can't be the case. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - sqrt(2)(hk + hl + kl) )

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for rhombohedral is different.

Wait, maybe I should remember the exact formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system.

I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h k + h l + k l) * sqrt(1 + 2 cos α - cos^2 α) )

Wait no, perhaps that's not the case. Another approach: let me think about the general interplanar distance formula for a triclinic system, which is the most general case, and then see if I can simplify it for the rhombohedral case.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a triclinic system is:

1/d^2 = (h²/a²)(sin^2 β sin^2 γ / (sin^2 α)) + (k²/b²)(sin^2 γ sin^2 α / (sin^2 β)) + (l²/c²)(sin^2 α sin^2 β / (sin^2 γ)) ) - (hk sin^2 α sin^2 β sin^2 γ )/(a b c (sin α sin β sin γ)) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. But in the rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ = theta.

So in that case, the formula simplifies.

So substituting a = b = c, and α = β = γ = theta.

Let me denote a as 'a', and theta as theta.

So the formula becomes:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) / a² ] * (sin^2 theta)^2 / (sin^2 theta) ) - ... Hmm, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - a^2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta ) / (1 - cos^2 theta )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the metric tensor. The interplanar distance can be found from the reciprocal lattice vectors. Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for d-spacing for a rhombohedral system.

Wait, I found a formula online once which I think is correct. For a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, no, that can't be right because for theta = 90 degrees (cubic system), cos(theta) is zero, and the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a minus sign in the denominator. So I must have messed up the sign somewhere. Let me verify.

Wait, in the cubic case, the interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt(h^2 +k^2 +l^2). So the formula should reduce to that when alpha is 90 degrees, so cos(theta) is zero.

So in the formula, the denominator must be (h² +k² +l²) - 2 cos(theta) (hk + hl + kl).

Wait, but when theta is 90 degrees, cos(theta)=0, so denominator becomes h² +k² +l², and d is a/sqrt that, which is correct.

So going back to the problem, with theta=30 degrees, cos(theta) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So denominator is: (1 + 1 + 1) - 2*(0.866)*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1) = 3 - 2*(0.866)*(3) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. Which can't be right because the square root of a negative number isn't a real number. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is actually:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 cos(theta) (hk + hl + kl) )

But if that's the case, when theta is 30 degrees, the denominator is 3 - 2*(0.866)*(3) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196, which is negative. That can't be possible. So perhaps I have the sign wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula should be:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 cos(theta) (hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, let's test that with theta=90 degrees. cos(theta)=0, so denominator is h² +k² +l², correct.

So let's apply it to the case where theta=30 degrees.

Denominator: 3 + 2*(0.866)*(3) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is about sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.491 Angstrom. Wait, but none of the options are that low. The options are around 9-10 Angstrom. So that can’t be right either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 cos(theta) (hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, but that gives a smaller d, which
