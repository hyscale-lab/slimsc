Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Let's see what I remember.

Rhombohedral crystals are one of the seven crystal systems. They have a cubic-like structure but with all the angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles α, β, and γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—does that mean the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms? Because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c. But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, right? So the unit cell edges are all the same length. So the interatomic distance is the same as 'a'. So a = 10 Angstroms.

Now, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the formula derived from the Miller indices. I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ) + ... Wait, no, wait. I might be mixing it up with something else. Oh wait, no—actually, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral (or any) system can be a bit tricky because of the angles involved.

Wait, yeah, the formula for interplanar distance for a general crystal system is d_{hkl} = (a)/(√(h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos γ)) )? Or wait, maybe it's a divided by the square root of that expression. Because for a cubic system, where all angles are 90 degrees, the formula simplifies to a/(sqrt(h² +k² +l²)). But since this is a rhombohedral system, the angles are all 30 degrees.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh right, the general formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² -
