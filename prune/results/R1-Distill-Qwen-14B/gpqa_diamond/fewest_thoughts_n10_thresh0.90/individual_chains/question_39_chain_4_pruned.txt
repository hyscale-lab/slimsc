Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so we have a large ensemble of identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, the wave function probably needs to be normalized because when you measure the position, the probabilities should sum to 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex-valued function, so this makes sense. The real and imaginary parts.

But when we normalize the wave function, the integral of the absolute square must equal 1. The absolute square is ψ*(x)ψ(x), which would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary part is -0.5i, so when squared, it contributes (0.5)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The absolute square of a complex number (a + ib) is a² + b². So here, ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) * (1 + 0i) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is [A] + [B], where A is real and B is imaginary. So the absolute square is A² + B². So for each x, |ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

But wait, no. Because ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So, when we compute |ψ(x)|², it's [ (a²)/(1+x) ) ] + (0.5)^2. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, the system's wave function is given for x between 1 and 3. The problem says that when they measured the positions, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function is zero outside this interval. So, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

So, the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and this is valid in the region where the particle can be found (x between 1 and 3). So, outside of this region, the wave function is zero. So, our integral is only from 1 to 3.

So, the integral ∫₁³ [ (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Let's compute this integral. Let me separate the terms.

First term: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

Second term: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each integral.

First integral: ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3. Let u = 1+x, du=dx. Limits when x=1: u=2, x=3: u=4. So integral of 1/u du from 2 to 4 is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, let's compute that. Let's compute the numerical value.

ln(2) is approximately 0.693147.

0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer is B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me compute 0.5 divided by ln(2):

ln(2) ≈ 0.693147.

0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7213475.

So a² is approximately 0.72134
