Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that behaves the same way under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, none of the particles are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, okay. So the wave function is given as ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, a wave function in quantum mechanics must satisfy the normalization condition, right? That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

So, the first thing I should do is normalize this wave function. Because if we don't know 'a', we can't proceed. And since the question gives us that the particles are found only between x=1 and x=3, I guess the wave function exists only in that region. So the wave function should be zero outside of this interval, but perhaps the given expression is valid between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, it's a complex function. But I remember that the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So, for normalization, we'll integrate |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3, and set that equal to 1.

Also, since the wave function is the same for all particles, and all measurements find them between 1 and 3, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. So, the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3.

So, let's write the normalization condition:

Integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Now, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let's compute |ψ(x)|².

The absolute square of a complex number z = z_real + z_imag i is (z_real)^2 + (z_imag)^2.

So, ψ(x) is a sum of two terms: a/(sqrt(1+x)) and -0.5i. So, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Therefore, |ψ(x)|² = (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (-0.5)^2.

Which simplifies to (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral becomes:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute each part separately.

First integral: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C.

So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Hence, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2). I remember ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let's double-check the steps. Did I miss anything?

Wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Did I correctly compute the absolute square? Let me see.

Yes, because |a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i|² = (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2
