Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which of the given compounds is the correct one based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me start by carefully reading the question and the options.

Okay, the question says that the compound has been characterized using FTIR and 1H NMR. Let's look at the FTIR data first. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The other strong peak is at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group because that would give a broad O-H peak and a strong carbonyl.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data. The problem states that there are several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens—like in alkenes or aromatic rings. That rules out any structures with those features, but looking at the options, I don't see any with vinyl groups or benzene rings, so maybe that's a clue about the substituents.

In the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplet of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplet of triplets. Hmm, splitting patterns can tell us a lot about the neighboring protons. Let me think about how splitting works. Each neighboring set of protons will split the signal into a multiplet. So, a doublet of triplets means the proton is next to two different sets of protons—maybe two different neighboring groups each with a certain number of protons.

Wait, actually, the splitting is more accurately described as each neighboring group causing a split. For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 group and a CH3, each will split the signal differently. Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options, each is a substituted pentanoic acid or similar. Let me write them out:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, structure: It's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So that's a four-carbon chain, where the second and third carbons each have a methyl and ethyl group attached. The end is a CH2 connected to a COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the middle two carbons each have a methyl (CH3) and ethyl (C2H5) group. Ends with a COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So, the second and third carbons each have a CH3 group attached. Ends with CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, middle carbons have CH3 groups, and ends with COOH.

Wait, the FTIR suggests a carboxylic acid, so all options have a COOH at the end, except I think all of them do. Let me check the options:

Looking at the options, they're all similar but differ in the substituents on the central carbons.

So, the key is the NMR splitting. Let's think about each option.

The NMR shows no vinyl hydrogens, which they all don't have, so that's a given.

Now, the splitting. Let me think about each structure.

Starting with option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

The structure would be: COOH is on the end, then CH3CH2 attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to another CH(CH3) and then to the CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3CH2 connected to the first CH, which is connected to CH3. Then another CH connected to CH3 and then the COOH.

Wait, perhaps visualizing it as:

The chain is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, the two CH groups each have a CH3. The middle part is two CH groups, each bearing a CH3.

In the NMR, the protons on the CH groups would have neighboring groups. Let's see, the central CH's protons would be next to which other protons.

Let me think about the central CH(CH3) groups. Each CH(CH3) is attached to two other carbons: one is CH3CH2, and the other is another CH(CH3).

Wait, the first CH(CH3) is connected to CH3CH2 on one side and CH(CH3) on the other. So, the protons on the first CH would be adjacent to: the CH3CH2 group (maybe a CH2 group next to it) and the other CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the protons on the CH groups would have different neighboring environments. Let me consider the coupling.

For example, the protons on
