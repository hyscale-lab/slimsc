Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. Let me think.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions that are compatible with certain symmetries. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6 operators being the most common.

So, the question is about which symmetries all operators must respect. I remember that in the Standard Model, Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental aspect. SMEFT should respect that too because it's an effective theory built from the SM, right? So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, in SMEFT, the operators are built from the SM fields, which are Poincare invariant. So all operators in SMEFT should also respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2 (Poincare) is also required. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

CP symmetry. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. In the Standard Model, except for certain sectors like the CKM matrix, CP is approximately a symmetry. But in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP by default? I think that the SMEFT operators can have terms that violate CP because they are effective operators. For instance, if the SM doesn't have a CP conservation (like in the Higgs potential), then SMEFT can include terms that break CP. So CP symmetry (option 3) isn't necessarily a requirement for all operators. So operators might violate CP, meaning 3 is not a must-respect symmetry.

CPT symmetry. Oh, right, in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. So any valid QFT must respect CPT symmetry. SMEFT is a QFT, so all its operators must respect CPT. So option 4 (CPT) is a must.

So putting it together, the symmetries that all SMEFT operators must respect are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C says 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me make sure. Poincare is just a combination of Lorentz and translations. If the theory is Lorentz symmetric, and the operators are built in a translation-invariant way (like local terms), then Poincare is respected. So both 1 and 2 are needed. CP isn't necessarily, but CPT is required because any QFT must have it. So yeah, the correct answer is C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to respect certain symmetries. Here's the analysis of the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry in SMEFT, as it is derived from the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must preserve this symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT operators are built from Standard Model fields, which are Poincaré-invariant, all operators in SMEFT also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model already allows for CP violation in certain sectors (e.g., the CKM matrix), and SMEFT can include operators that break CP. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory (QFT), and SMEFT is a QFT. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C**.

Answer: C
