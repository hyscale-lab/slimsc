Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps, and each transformation gives a new compound. Plus, there are some hints provided, so I should make sure to read those carefully.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are important. Let's look at them.

Hint a) says that when compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides typically are used in Wittig reactions. So, a Wittig reaction would form an alkene. The product here has a cyclopentane ring with substituents.

Let me think: the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The structure would be a cyclopentane ring where carbons 1 and 2 have methyl groups. Carbon 4 has a substituent which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH2CH(CH3))-, right? So the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached via the double bond.

Wait, no. Wait, the propan-2-ylidene group would be the ylide part, which would have a double bond. So when the Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with compound A, which is presumably an aldehyde or ketone, it forms an alkene.

So compound A must be an aldehyde or ketone, reacting with the ylide to form an alkene. Since the product has a cyclopentane ring with a substituent, I think compound A is a cyclic ketone, perhaps cyclopentanone.

Wait, let me think. If the Wittig reaction forms an alkene, the starting aldehyde or ketone would have the carbonyl group where the alkene is formed. So if the product has a cyclopentane ring with substituents, the starting material would be a cyclopentanone derivative.

Wait, but the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure mentally.

The cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at carbons 1 and 2. At carbon 4, there's a substituent which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH(CH3)-, but wait, no, the ylide structure is CH2=CHCH2- something?

Wait, no, the ylides are typically in the form P=CHR2, but when they react, the R2 group adds to the carbonyl. So for example, if the ylide is from propanal, it would be CH2CH2P=CH2?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. A Wittig reaction involves an ylide (like PR3=CH-) reacting with a carbonyl (RCOR' or RCHO). The ylide's R groups attack the carbonyl, leading to the formation of an alkene.

So the product would have a double bond between the carbons that were connected to the original carbonyl and the ylide's carbons.

In the product, 4-(propan-2-ylidene) group suggests that the substituent is a propenyl group. Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH(CH2CH3)=CH2? Or CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as CH2-CH(CH3)- with a double bond. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 attached as a substituent on the cyclopentane ring, but with a double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2CH2 with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH3) group attached via a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on that. Let me think differently. If the product has a double bond from the Wittig reaction, then the starting compound A must have a carbonyl group (like ketone) that is at a specific position.

Alternatively, perhaps compound A is cyclopentanone, and when it reacts with the ylide, the Wittig forms an alkene. So cyclopentanone would have a carbonyl group at, say, position 1. Then the ylide would add at that position, forming a double bond.

But wait, the product is a cyclopentane with substituents. Oh, perhaps the starting material is a substituted cyclopentanone.

Alternatively, maybe compound A is a cyclopentanone with substituents at positions 1 and 2. Then, the Wittig reaction would add a new group, perhaps at position 4.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the IR hints.

Hint b) says that compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. So compound A is likely a ketone, as aldehydes typically have higher wavenumbers, around 1720 cm^-1, but sometimes can be lower. But 1750 is more likely a ketone. So A is a cyclic ketone, perhaps cyclopentanone.

So, A is cyclopentanone, or a substituted version. Let's suppose A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone? Or maybe 1-methylcyclopentanone.

Wait, but the product of the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the product has methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a substituent at 4 which is a propenyl group.

So, perhaps the starting compound A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, when it reacts with the ylide (say, from propanal), the Wittig would form an alkene from the carbonyl group.

Wait, let me imagine. If A is 4-ketocyclopentane (cyclopentanone), but with substituents at 1 and 2 as methyl groups. Then the Wittig reaction would form a double bond next to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product after Wittig would have a double bond where the carbonyl was. So if the carbonyl was at position 4, the Wittig would form a double bond between 3 and 4? Or maybe between 4 and another carbon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to draw this.

Suppose A is cyclopentanone. The structure is a five-membered ring with a ketone at position 1. When it reacts with HCN, it forms compound B. Wait, that's another reaction. But first, let me think about the Wittig reaction.

Wait, no. The Wittig reaction is when A is treated with a phosphorous ylide. So, if A is a ketone, the Wittig would form an alkene.

So, for example, if A is 4-ketocyclopentane (cyclopentanone), the Wittig would form an alkene between carbons 1 and 2, perhaps.

Wait, no. Let me think. The general reaction is:

RCOR' + ylide (PR3=CHR'') â†’ RCH=CHR' + PR3OR''

So the carbonyl (R-CO-R') becomes R-CH2-CH2-R'? No, more accurately, the carbonyl group (O) is replaced by a CH2 group from the ylide, forming a double bond between the adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should think of cyclopentanone as (cyclopentyl)ketone. So when it undergoes Wittig reaction, the carbonyl group (C=O) is replaced by a CH2 group from the ylide, forming a double bond.

Wait, so the product would be cyclopentylidene something.

Alternatively, perhaps the ylide is a propyl group. Let me think: the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituent at position 4 is propan-2-ylidene, which would be CH2-CH(CH3)- with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)- attached via a double bond. So the structure would be cyclopentane with methyl at 1 and 2, and a group at 4 which is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 attached via double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenyl group. Let me think, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CHCH2- or maybe CH(CH2CH3)= ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the structure of the product. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the substituent is on carbon 4 of the cyclopentane ring. It's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a propene group with the double bond starting on the second carbon.

Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH(CH3
