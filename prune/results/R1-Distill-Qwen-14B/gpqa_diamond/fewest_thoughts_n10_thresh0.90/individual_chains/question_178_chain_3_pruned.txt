Okay, so I have this problem about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Hmm, right. I remember that in QFT, the dimension of the coupling constants is important for renormalizability. Renormalizable theories have couplings with positive or zero mass dimension, I think. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of each field and the coupling κ. The mass dimension is crucial because when considering the renormalizability, we look at the superficial degree of divergence of the Feynman diagrams. For a theory to be renormalizable, all couplings must have a mass dimension less than or equal to 4 (in 4 spacetime dimensions). Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, in 4 dimensions, each coupling's dimension should be such that the terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension 4, because the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 (since the action is dimensionless in natural units, and the integral is over four dimensions).

So for each term in the Lagrangian, like kinetic terms or interaction terms, their dimensions must be 4.

Let me list the fields involved. The fields are ψ (fermion), F^{μν} (field strength tensor), and σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, so it's a Lorentz tensor. But I think for the purpose of dimension counting, the σ_{μν} is part of the term, so I can treat it as part of the interaction.

Wait, but ψ is a spinor, so its mass dimension. In 4D, a Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because for a scalar field, it's 1. For a vector boson, it's 1 as well, because the field strength F has dimension 2. Wait, let me make sure.

In 4D spacetime, the fields have specific mass dimensions. The scalar field φ has [φ] = 1. The vector field A has [A]_μ = 1 (since F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, and derivatives have dimension 1, so [F] = 2). For spinors, ψ is a spinor field, so [ψ] = 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (iD - m)ψ = 0, and D has dimension 1 (since derivative is dimension 1), so ψ must have dimension (1 + dimension of m) / 1? Wait, no. The mass term is m ψ̄ ψ, which must have dimension 4. So each ψ has dimension (4 - [m]) / 2. Since [m] is 1 (mass has dimension 1), each ψ is (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So yes, [ψ] = 3/2.

Now, the term in the Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Wait, let me figure out the dimensions of each part.

First, ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimensions (3/2) + (3/2) )= 3, because σ is a Lorentz scalar made from two γ matrices. Wait, no, σ_{μν} is a tensor, but it's constructed from two gamma matrices. Each gamma matrix is dimensionless because they're just matrices. So σ_{μν} is a Lorentz tensor but dimensionless.

So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. And F^{μν} has dimension 2, as established earlier.

So the entire term is ψ̄ σ ψ F, which is 3 + 2 =5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the coupling κ must adjust this. So the dimension of κ times 5 must be 4, because the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F). Wait, no, wait. Wait, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so [κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F)] =4.

Wait, each term is like κ multiplied by the product of fields. So let's compute the dimension of (ψ̄ σ ψ F^{μν}):

ψ̄ has 3/2, σ is dimensionless, ψ has 3/2, F has 2. So adding them: 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5.

So the product has dimension 5, and when multiplied by κ, which is a coupling, the entire term must have dimension 4. So [κ] * 5 =4. Therefore, [κ] =4/5? Wait, wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because usually, couplings in 4D have dimensions like 0, 1, or maybe 2.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the dimensions. Let me re-express this.

Each field's dimension: ψ is 3/2, F is 2.

In the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, the dimensions are: ψ̄ (3/2) + ψ (3/2) + F^{μν} (2), and σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

So 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3 +2=5. So the product of the fields has dimension 5. So κ must have dimension [κ] =4 -5 = -1? Because the term (κ times fields) must have dimension 4.

Wait, no. Because the term is L_int = κ (ψ̄ σ ψ F), so the dimension of this term is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] +3/2 +3/2 +2 = [κ] +5. Since the term must have dimension 4, [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, about renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the couplings have positive mass dimension or zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the general rule is that a renormalizable interaction term in 4D must have a coupling with mass dimension ≤4, but more importantly, each coupling's dimension must be ≥0? No, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a term to be renormalizable, the coupling's dimension must be ≥ the number of fields minus 4. Or wait, no, I think the condition is that the superficial degree of divergence is non
