Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? So in this case, it's a Ca-EDTA complex.

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Stochiometric probably means it's the exact ratio, like 1:1. So each formula unit of the complex has one Ca²+ ion and one EDTA^4- ion.

The K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. Wait, K here is the formation constant, Kf. Formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, and Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So initially, before any dissociation, all the Ca and EDTA are tied up in the complex. But some of it will dissociate because the complex can break apart a little.

Let me set up the variables. Let's say the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, it releases some Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So at equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 - x. But wait, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and forms a very stable complex, the x might be very small compared to 0.02, so maybe we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the formation constant equation would be Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5x10^10. Plugging in the values, 5e10 ≈ (0.02)/(x * x) because [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both x.

So 5e10 ≈ 0.02/(x²). Rearranging, x² ≈ 0.02/(5e10). Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13. Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5. Hmm, wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait, Kf is given as 5e10. So [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. So Kf = (0.02) / (x^2) = 5e10. Solving for x: x² = 0.02/(5e10)
