Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The conditions are ideal pH, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable. So in this case, K is pretty large, 5e10, which suggests that the complex is very stable, meaning most of the EDTA is tied up with calcium.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. I think that means [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. Now, I need to find [Ca²+]. 

I recall that when EDTA forms a complex with a metal ion, the reaction can be written as:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-
And the formation constant K is given by:
K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in solution, the EDTA is usually in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Oh right, but the question says the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that. I think at the right pH, EDTA is in the form that can donate the four negative charges, so it's acting as a proper ligand.

So in this case, because the complex is formed and K is given, I can set up the expression. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M because the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. 

So plugging into the K expression:
5e10 = (0.02) / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, but I don't know [EDTA^4-] yet. Hmm. Wait, another thing I remember is that EDTA exists in solution in various protonated forms, but at a specific pH, it's deprotonated enough to have four negative charges, and that the concentration of EDTA^4- can be found using the acid dissociation constants. But since the pH is ideal, I think the problem might be simplifying this and assuming that the concentration of free EDTA (EDTA^4-) is equal to the concentration of the complex that dissociates. Or perhaps, there's another approach.

Wait, maybe another way. If the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, and the complex dissociates to release Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, then the total concentration of EDTA in solution is the sum of the free EDTA and the EDTA bound in the complex. But since the complex is so stable (K is very large), the amount of free EDTA should be very small compared to the complex. So, [EDTA^4-] ≈ x, and [Ca²+] ≈ x, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think more carefully.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's say that the complex dissociates a little, so:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Wait, no. Wait, the complex dissociates as:
CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-
So for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then at equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But since K is very large (5e10), x will be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02.

So, K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10 ≈ 0.02/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²)

So, 5e10 ≈ 0.02/(x²)
Then, x² ≈ 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4 * 1e-13 = 4e-14

Wait, that's not right. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

Wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e
