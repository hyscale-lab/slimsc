Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios after a hypothetical event. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III process stopped, the change in neutrino flux here would be felt almost immediately, right? But since neutrinos are produced, their flux would depend on the production rates.

So the pp-III branch—let me recall. The proton-proton chain is the main source of the Sun's energy. There are a couple of branches. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, producing helium-4, and then later carbon and oxygen through the CNO cycle. Oh wait, no, the CNO cycle is another process. Right, the pp chain primarily has two main branches: pp-I and pp-II. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The pp chain can have different branches, like the pp-I and pp-II, but in the Sun, the dominant is the pp-I. pp-III might be a less common branch, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton chain. I think the main pp chain produces boron-8, which then decays into lithium-7, but perhaps pp-III is a branch that produces different isotopes or has a different path. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces lower-energy neutrinos compared to other branches.

Wait, but the question is about the flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the pp-III branch contributes to these energy ranges.

If the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux in these bands? I remember that the dominant neutrino emission from the Sun comes from the decay of boron-8, which is produced in the pp chain. The pp chain produces higher-energy neutrinos, while other processes like the CNO cycle produce lower-energy ones. But wait, I'm not certain about the exact energy ranges.

Alternatively, each branch may produce neutrinos of different energies. So if pp-III stops, perhaps a certain portion of the neutrino flux would be affected. For example, if the pp-III branch was contributing a significant amount of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range, stopping it would decrease that flux. But if it didn't contribute much to the 800-900 keV range, the ratio would change.

Wait, I think the pp chain produces higher-energy neutrinos than the CNO cycle. Let me see: Boron-8 has a half-life of about 7 seconds and decays into lithium-7, emitting a neutrino. The energy of the neutrinos from this decay is about 15-25 MeV, which is much higher than the bands in the question. So that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the neutrino energies. The Sun's neutrino spectrum peaks at around 10 MeV, but how about the specific branches? Or perhaps this is about the energy of the neutrinos produced in each process.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about neutrinos from different reactions in the pp chain. For instance, the pp-III branch could be a part of the chain that emits neutrinos at lower energies, perhaps around a few MeV or less.

Wait, but in the question, the bands are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Those are in the MeV range, since 1 MeV is 1000 keV. So 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, 900 keV is 0.9 MeV. So these are lower energy neutrinos compared to, say, the 10 MeV ones I was thinking of.

So if the pp-III branch stopped, and it was a significant source of these lower-energy neutrinos, then the flux in those bands would drop. But how does the pp-III compare to other processes?

Wait, another possibility: the main neutrino production in the Sun comes from the decay of boron-8 (pp-I branch), which produces high-energy neutrinos. The other branches, like pp-II and pp-III, might produce lower-energy neutrinos.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, which perhaps is a branch that contributes to medium-energy neutrinos, then the flux in that band would drop. But the question is about the ratio of two specific bands.

Wait, another approach: consider the neutrino energy spectrum. The main pp chain produces higher-energy neutrinos, and perhaps the other branches (like pp-II and pp-III) contribute to lower energies. So if pp-III is stopped, the lower-energy bands (like 700-800 keV) would see a decrease in flux, while the higher band (800-900 keV) might be less affected or perhaps not. But I'm not sure about the exact energy ranges these branches contribute to.

Wait, but the CNO cycle also produces neutrinos. The CNO cycle is a proton burning process that occurs at higher temperatures than the pp chain. It produces carbon and oxygen and emits neutrinos when nitrogen-14 decays. The CNO neutrinos have lower energies than the pp chain's, but I'm not certain about their exact energies.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the neutrino energies from different sources. The pp chain's main neutrino source is boron-8 decay, which gives high-energy neutrinos (about 10s of MeV). The CNO cycle produces lower-energy neutrinos, perhaps around 2-4 MeV. Or wait, maybe the CNO neutrinos are even lower, around a few hundred keV? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor branch that produces lower-energy neutrinos. If it stops, then less neutrinos in that energy range would be emitted.

In the problem, the pp-III branch stopped. So the neutrinos from that branch would no longer contribute. The question is about the flux ratio between two bands. Let's say band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV).

If the pp-III branch primarily contributes to band 1, then stopping it would cause a drop in band 1's flux. But if it doesn't contribute much to band 2, then band 2's flux remains roughly the same.

In that case, the ratio (band1/band2) would decrease. So if band1's flux goes down and band2's stays roughly the same, the ratio would be smaller than 1.

Wait, but what's the usual flux ratio before the pp-III stops? Before stopping, pp-III contributes to band1, but maybe not to band2 much. So the flux in band1 is higher than band2. If pp-III is the main source for band1 but not for band2, then after stopping, the flux in band1 drops, but band2 remains unaffected.

So the ratio would now be (reduced band1) / (same band2) = less than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps both bands are affected, but band1 more than band2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the typical solar neutrino spectrum.

The solar neutrino flux peaks around 10 MeV, but there's a lower-energy component as well. The CNO cycle's neutrinos are in the 2-4 MeV range, and the pp chain's neutrinos (from boron-8) are higher, around 10-15 MeV.

But wait, perhaps the pp-III branch emits neutrinos at lower energies, say around 1 MeV or lower. So the bands in the question are 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. If the pp-III contributes to these lower energies, stopping it would cause a significant drop in the flux in those bands.

But if the pp-III only contributes to band1, then the flux in band1 would drop, while band2 (which, say, is higher and perhaps comes from another source, like the CNO cycle) remains the same.

Wait, but the CNO cycle's neutrinos are higher, around 2-4 MeV. So perhaps the bands in the question (0.7-0.9 MeV) are actually from a different source, like the pp-III.

So without the pp-III, the flux in band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) would drop, but band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) might not be as affected. So the ratio would be much lower.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact energy ranges. Let me think again.

If the pp-III branch was producing neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, then stopping it would mean that the flux in that band would decrease, while other bands, perhaps higher, would be unaffected or less affected. Alternatively, if the pp-III contributes neutrinos at higher energies, like 0.8-0.9 MeV, then the bands would be affected accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos, with a peak somewhere. But I'm not certain about the specifics.

Wait, maybe thinking in terms of the total flux. The total solar neutrino flux is about 6 x 10^10 per cm² per second. The flux is dominated by the pp chain, but CNO contributes about 1-2% of the total.

The neutrinos from the pp chain (like from boron-8 decay) are higher energy (around 10 MeV), while CNO's neutrinos are lower, around 2-4 MeV. But the question is about even lower energies, around 0.7-0.9 MeV.

Hmm, perhaps that's not from the main pp or CNO processes. Maybe from other sources, like the decay of other isotopes?

Wait, another possibility: the neutrinos from the proton-electron scattering. Wait, but I'm not sure if that produces neutrinos of that energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the neutrinos emitted during the fusion process. For example, in the pp chain, when a proton captures a positron, it emits a neutrino, but I think those energies are lower. Or perhaps during the process of deuterium formation, when a neutron is captured, a neutrino is emitted.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try an alternative approach. The question is about the ratio of fluxes in two bands after the pp-III branch stops.

If the pp-III branch contributes significantly to band1 (700-800 keV) but not so much to band2 (800-900 keV), then the ratio would decrease.

Alternatively, if it contributes equally to both bands, then the ratio would remain the same. Or if it contributes more to band2, the ratio would increase.

But without knowing the exact contribution, perhaps we can think about the nature of the pp-III branch.

The pp-III branch is a minor branch in the proton-proton chain. In the main pp chain (pp-I), two protons fuse to deuterium, then another proton fuses to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 combine to form helium-4, with a couple of steps in between. The pp-II branch involves a different path, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch involves reactions that emit lower-energy neutrinos. So if it stops, lower-energy neutrinos (like in band1) would decrease, while higher-energy ones (band2) remain the same.

If band1's flux is, say, 10 times higher than band2 before the pp-III stops, and after stopping, band1's flux drops by a factor of 10, then the new ratio would be 1. Or maybe if pp-III contributes more to band1 than band2, the ratio would be lower.

Wait, another angle: the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with a certain spectrum. Let's assume that the flux in band1 is dominated by the pp-III, while band2 is also affected but to a lesser extent.

So if the pp-III was producing, say, 90% of the flux in band1 and 10% in band2, then stopping it would cause the flux in band1 to drop to 10% of its original, and band2 to drop to 90% of its original.

The original ratio was (0.9 band1)/(0.1 band2) = 9. After stopping, the new ratio would be (0.1 original_band1) / (0.9 original_band2) = (0.1/0.9) * (original_band1 / original_band2) = (1/9) * 9 = 1. So the ratio would be 1. But that's just an example.

Alternatively, if the pp-III contributes more to band1 than band2, the ratio would decrease. For instance, if pp-III was contributing 50% to band1 and 10% to band2, then without it, band1 would be halved and band2 would drop by 10%. The original ratio was (0.5B1)/(0.1B2) = 5.

After stopping, ratio is (0.5B1)/(0.9B2) * (something? Wait, no. After stopping, the pp-III contribution is gone, so the remaining flux in band1 is 0.5B1 (assuming other sources contribute 50% to band1), and band2 is 0.9B2 (assuming pp-III contributed 10% to band2).

So the new ratio is (0.5B1) / (0.9B2) = (5/9) * (B1/B2) original ratio.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me model this with numbers.

Assume:

Before stopping:

Flux_band1 = F1 = F_ppIII_1 + F_other_1

Flux_band2 = F2 = F_ppIII_2 + F_other_2

After stopping:

Flux_band1 = F_other_1

Flux_band2 = F_other_2

We need to find F_other_1 / F_other_2.

If we can assume that F_ppIII_2 is much smaller than F_other_2, and F_ppIII_1 is a significant fraction of F1, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is the only source of neutrinos in band1, and it doesn't contribute to band2. Then after stopping, F_band1 becomes zero, and F_band2 remains the same. Then the ratio is zero. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes only to band1, and other processes (like CNO) contribute to band2. Then after stopping, band1 flux drops, band2 remains same. So the ratio would be new_band1 / new_band2 = (old_band1 - ppIII_band1) / old_band2.

But if ppIII_band1 was a significant fraction of old_band1, the ratio could drop.

Wait, but the options given are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

If the pp-III only affects band1, and band2 is unaffected, the ratio would be (band1 without ppIII) / band2.

But without knowing the original ratio, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes neutrinos that have energies in band1 and band2, but more so in band1.

If the pp-III produces a flux in band1 that is ten times higher than in band2, then the ratio F1/F2 would be 10. If the pp-III is stopped, and it was the main source of F1 but not F2, then F1 drops to negligible and F2 remains the same, making the ratio approach zero. But zero isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of F1 to F2 is 10 before the pp-III stops. After stopping, if F1 is reduced by a factor of 10, the ratio becomes 1. So the answer would be C) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes about the same amount to both bands, so the ratio remains roughly 1.

Wait, but why would the pp-III affect the ratio? Let me think about the production.

Another approach: solar neutrino flux is dominated by the pp chain. The pp chain has different branches, but the main one (pp-I) produces higher-energy neutrinos. The other branches, like pp-II and pp-III, are minor and produce lower-energy neutrinos.

If pp-III stopped, the lower-energy neutrinos (like in band1 and band2) would be reduced. But since the main pp process (pp-I) continues, the higher-energy neutrinos would still be produced.

But the question is about the flux ratio between two lower-energy bands.

Wait, perhaps in the Sun, the main pp-I process contributes neutrinos at higher energies, and the pp-III contributes at lower. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in the lower bands drops, making their ratio to each other change.

But without knowing the exact energy distribution, it's challenging. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III produces neutrinos with a certain energy distribution that peaks in band1 but not in band2.

If the pp-III was the main source of neutrinos in band1, then without it, band1's flux drops, while band2's flux remains about the same (assuming it's from another process like the CNO cycle or another branch).

So the ratio would be (flux_band1_without_ppIII) / (flux_band2).

If the pp-III was contributing 10 times more to band1 than band2, and other sources contribute the same to both bands, then the original ratio would be (10x + a) / (x + a), where a is the flux from other sources.

But after stopping, it becomes a/(x+a). If a is small compared to x+a, then the ratio would be (10x + a) / (x + a) ≈ 10 before, then a/(x+a) ≈ a/x = (a/(x+a)) * (x+a)/x = (a/x) * (1 + a/x). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio before stopping is 10, and after stopping, the pp-III's contribution is gone, making the ratio drop by a factor of 10, so 1.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: the pp
