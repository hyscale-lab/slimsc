Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Without spots, the ratio is something, and when spots are present, it changes. The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots is the factor.

Hmm, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy. So, the ratio should depend exponentially on the temperature.

Wait, the problem gives a transition wavelength of about 1448 Å. So that's the wavelength corresponding to the energy difference between the two levels. I think that because E = hc/λ, so the energy difference ΔE = hc/(λ). 

So, the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/(λ). Let me compute that numerically. But wait, maybe I can express it in terms of k and T, since the temperatures are given.

The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). But wait, actually, the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Because the equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i is higher than E_j, then the exponent is negative, meaning n_i is less than n_j? Wait, no, wait: if E_i is higher than E_j, then (E_i - E_j) is positive, so the exponent is negative, so exp(-positive), which is less than 1. So n_i is less than n_j. So the lower level has more atoms.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So the original ratio (without spots) is higher, and when the spots are present, the ratio becomes lower. That suggests that the temperature has dropped. Because the ratio depends exponentially on temperature.

So, without spots, T_eff is 6000 K, with spots, 5500 K. So when T decreases, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Let me think: So if the temperature goes down, the exponent becomes more negative, since (E2 - E1)/(k T) is larger when T is smaller. So exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) becomes smaller. Thus, n1/n2 decreases, which aligns with the problem statement. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. So the ratio without spots is higher than when spots are present.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

We can model this using the Boltzmann equation. Let me write the ratio as R = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), right? Wait, no. Let me get the exact expression.

Wait, the correct expression is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp
