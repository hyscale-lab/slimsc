Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star whose properties change when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots. The main points are: when the star has spots, its effective temperature (Teff) drops from 6000K to 5500K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes, specifically (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = ?

Hmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n1 and n2) is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of ~1448 Å. That wavelength probably tells me about the energy difference between the two levels. Let me calculate the energy difference using the wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So, I can find ΔE = E2 - E1 using this. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

Wait, let me compute that ΔE.

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)
= (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1448e-10 m)
= 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7
≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, we might need this in terms of per atom, so that's correct.

But when using the Boltzmann factor, we can express the exponent in terms of temperature. Let me think about the ratio.

The ratio is (n1 / n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Rearranged, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T))

But since the problem gives the ratio when the star has spots (T=5500K) and without spots (T=6000K), I can compute the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

Let me denote R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T)) 

So, the factor we're looking for is (R_without_spots) / (R_with_spots) = [ (g1/g2 exp(ΔE/(k*6000))) ] / [ (g1/g2 exp(ΔE/(k*5500))) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out because they're the same in numerator and denominator. So, the factor becomes exp[ ΔE/(k*6000) - ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp[ (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) ]

Wait, no: let me double-check the signs. Because the exponent when you take the ratio would be (ΔE/(k T1) ) - (ΔE/(k T2) ), right? Because R1 is for T1 =6000, R2 for T2=5500.

So, R1 / R2 = exp[ (ΔE/(k T1) ) - (ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Factor out ΔE/(k): 

= exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

Now, compute the value inside the exponent.

Compute 1/6000 - 1/5500.

Let me calculate that:

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 per K
1/5500 ≈0.000181818 per K

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1/6000 is about 1.666e-4, and 1/5500 is approximately 1.818e-4.

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 would be 1.666e-4 - 1.818e-4 = -1.52e-5 per K.

Wait, but wait, no, I think I have it reversed. Because T1 is 6000, T2 is 5500. So 1/T1 is less than 1/T2, so the difference is negative. So the exponent becomes negative.

Wait, but in the ratio R without spots is R1 (6000K) and R with spots is R2 (5500K). So R1/R2 is the factor we're computing, which is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots (5500K), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So without spots (6000K), the ratio is higher. So R1 > R2. Therefore, the factor would be greater than 1.

Wait, but let me think again about the ratio. (n1/n2) = [g1/g2] * exp( (ΔE)/(k T) )

If T increases, the exponent (ΔE/(k T)) becomes smaller, since T is in the denominator. So when T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases, which makes (n1/n2) decrease if all else is equal.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: level 1 is lower in energy than level 2. So E2 > E1. So ΔE is positive. So (ΔE)/(k T) is positive.

So for higher T, (ΔE)/(k T) is smaller, so exp( that ) is larger. Wait, no, wait: exp( x ) increases as x increases. So if T increases, x decreases, so exp(x) decreases. So when T is higher, the ratio (n1/n2) would be lower. So higher T leads to lower n1/n2 ratio.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

If E2 > E1, then the energy difference is positive. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), wait no, because the equation is (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) ) 

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

The Boltzmann distribution is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. The correct formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Because higher energy levels have lower populations.

So if E2 > E1, then (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So the ratio (n1/n2) is (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, that's what I had before. So when T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) is smaller, so the exponent is smaller, so exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) is smaller. Therefore, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * [something that decreases with increasing T]

So, if T increases, (n1/n2) decreases. So when the star has higher T (no spots), the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when it has lower T (with spots).

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That is, when T is lower (5500K), the ratio is lower. So that doesn't match with what I just concluded. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ratio (n2/n1) instead. Let me think again.

The Boltzmann equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Assuming E_i > E_j, so E_i - E_j is positive.

So (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( - (positive number)/(k T) )

Which is (g_i/g_j) multiplied by a number less than 1, since exp(-x) is less than 1 for positive x.

So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio (n_i/n_j) increases.

So, for higher T, higher energy level (n_i) has a higher population relative to lower energy level (n_j).

Wait, that makes sense. So, higher T favors higher energy states.

Wait, but the problem says that when the effective temperature decreases (with spots), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So if the ratio is (n1/n2), which would be (g1/g2) exp( (ΔE)/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express.

Wait, let me define level 1 as lower energy (E1) and level 2 as higher energy (E2). So ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive.

The ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) )

Wait, no! I think my earlier consideration was wrong. Because the Boltzmann factor for being in a higher energy state is lower. So the correct formula is:

n2 /n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is the same as before. So, higher T makes (E2 - E1)/(k T) smaller, so exp(...) is larger.

So (n1/n2) is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, so when T increases, (n1/n2) increases. So, the ratio without spots (higher T) is higher than with spots (lower T). So without spots, the ratio is higher. The problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So that aligns with this.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, higher T, higher ratio.

So, when they say the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that's correct. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

So, when computing (R_no_spots) / (R_with_spots), which is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But wait, according to the formula, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T))

So for T=6000, we have exp(ΔE/(k*6000)), and for T=5500, it's exp(ΔE/(k*550
