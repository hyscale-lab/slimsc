Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, right? It's about finding the interplanar distance for a specific plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, let's recall what a rhombohedral crystal is. I remember that a rhombohedron has all edges of equal length (so it's like a cube that's been skewed), and all the angles between the edges are equal too. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait. Rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or maybe I'm mixing that up. No, wait, no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system. Or is that the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal and all angles are equal but not 90 degrees. Oh, right, so in the cubic system, when all angles are 90 degrees, it's cubic. But when the angles are different but all the same (like in this case, 30 degrees), it's rhombohedral. Okay, so that makes sense.

The interatomic distance given is 10 Angstroms. So the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms. Because in a rhombohedral system, all edges are the same length, so a = b = c.

The question is about the (111) plane's interplanar distance. Interplanar distance is calculated using the formula from X-ray diffraction, I think. Oh right, the Bragg's Law formula for interplanar spacing is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos θ + 2hl cos θ + 2kl cos θ ), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Or wait, no, that's for a general case with different angles. Maybe I should recall the Miller indices and the formula for d-spacing.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = (1/√( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2(hk cos γ)/ (a
