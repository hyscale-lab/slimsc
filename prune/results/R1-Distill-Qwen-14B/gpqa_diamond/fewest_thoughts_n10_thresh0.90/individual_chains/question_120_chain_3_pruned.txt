Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution—so that means the density of stars is the same everywhere, right? But wait, does that mean they're uniformly spread in space or just on the celestial sphere? I think in this context, it probably means uniform in space, so their distance from us isn't the only factor.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So I need to find a relation between the number of stars and the parallax range. Parallax is a measure of distance, right? Because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh yeah, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance.

Wait, so if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density is constant. Number density, n, is stars per unit volume. So as you move outward, the number of stars increases with volume. But parallax is a function of distance. So I need to relate the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d+dd to the parallax.

Let me think about the volume of a spherical shell. The volume is 4π r² dr. So for a radial thickness dr, the volume is proportional to r squared. But how does that relate to parallax? Because plx p = 1/r (since 1 parsec is about 3.26 light-years, but the exact conversion isn't needed here). So r = 1/p. So dr = - (1/p²) dp. Because if r increases, p decreases.

Wait, let's see. p = 1/r → r = 1/p. So dr = - (1/p²) dp. So when you take a shell from p to p + dp, the corresponding r is from 1/p to 1/(p+dp). Hmm, maybe it's easier to express the volume in terms of p.

The volume of a shell at radius r is 4π r² dr. Let's substitute r in terms of p. So r = 1/p → dr = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - (1/p²) dp ) → but wait, since we're considering a small dp, the negative sign indicates the direction, but for the magnitude, it's 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. So 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recast it. The volume element in terms of p is perhaps easier.

Alternatively, let's think about the change in volume when considering a change in parallax. Since p = 1/r, a small change dp is related to dr by dp = - (1/r²) dr → dr = - r² dp. So substituting r=1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp.

So, the volume of a thin shell at radius r (i.e., parallax p) with thickness dr is 4π r² dr. Substituting r=1/p and dr:

Volume = 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p² dp). Wait, wait, the dr is negative because as p increases, r decreases. But since we're considering the number of stars, we're interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign. So Volume = 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, so the volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p^4) dp. So if the number density of stars is n (constant), then the number of stars in that shell is n * volume → n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So if we have a small change in p (dp), the number of stars is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "number of stars per unit range of parallax". So it's the number per unit dp, which is (n *4π) * (1/p^4) ) * dp. So per unit dp, it's proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as p^4.

Wait, but the options are in terms of how the number changes with plx. So as plx increases, the number per unit plx range decreases as 1/plx^4. So the number density in terms of parallax is proportional to 1/(plx)^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the number of stars is uniform in space, then the number in a volume dV is n dV. The volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p^4) dp. So number of stars per unit p is n * 4π / p^4.

So the number per unit range of plx (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit plx range decreases as p increases, and the rate is 1/p^4.

Looking at the options: option A is ~ 1/plx^4, option B is 1/plx^2, etc.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by assuming that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, \( n \), is constant. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( p = 1/r \), where \( r \) is the distance to the star. 

The volume of a thin spherical shell at radius \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is given by \( 4\pi r^2 dr \). Substituting \( r = 1/p \), we find \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). The volume of the shell in terms of \( p \) becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the number density \( n \) and the volume, so:

\[
\text{Number of stars} = n \cdot \text{Volume} = n \
