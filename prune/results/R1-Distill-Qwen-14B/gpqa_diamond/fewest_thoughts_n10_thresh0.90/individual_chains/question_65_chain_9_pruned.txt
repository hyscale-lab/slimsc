Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to determine the major products based on the given reagents and conditions. Then, among the options A to D, I have to pick the correct combination.

First, let's tackle reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is reacting with THF, KH, and H+ to give product A.

Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. But wait, the reaction is done with THF and then H+. So maybe it's a two-step process. Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by something else.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The structure is spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol with a vinyl group at position 1. So, maybe it's something like a bicyclic system?

Wait, spiro[3.5]non suggests that the spiro atom is connected to two rings, one with 3 carbons and the other with 5 carbons. So, the molecule has a bridge structure, perhaps like a bicyclo system.

Wait, but wait. 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Let me draw it mentally. The spiro atom is C1, which is connected to a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, C1 has the vinyl group and the hydroxyl group?

Wait, no. The formula is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro is at position 1. So, structure is a spiro ring where the spiro atom (C1) is connected to a vinyl group (CH2-CH2?), no, wait, the vinyl is at position 1, so it's CH2=CH- attached to the spiro center.

Also, there's a double bond at position 5. So, the spiro compound has a five-membered ring and a three-membered ring? Or maybe a six-membered and five? Wait, the spiro notation is [n.m], where n and m are the number of carbons in each ring. So spiro[3.5]non would have two rings: one with 3 carbons and another with 5, connected at the spiro atom.

Wait, no. Spiro numbering: the spiro atom is the connecting point. So, for spiro[m.n]something, the rings are m and n carbons each. So in the molecule, the non part is nine carbons in total. Wait, but the total number of carbons would be 9, but considering the spiro, it's two rings connected at a single carbon.
