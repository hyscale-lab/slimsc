Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation for a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me try to think through this.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. It looks like a hydrocarbon with several substituents and double bonds. I think I'll need to count all the atoms, especially the carbons and hydrogens, because the problem gives me bond energies, so maybe I can calculate the enthalpy change from the elements.

Wait, the question gives the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is breaking down the elements into their atoms. So for each carbon in the molecule, I'd need to consider their atomization.

The bond energies provided are for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. So I guess I'll need to calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in the molecule and then compare that to the energy released when the bonds form.

Enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So in this case, the elements are carbon and hydrogen. The formation reaction would be something like:

n C(graphite) + m H2(g) → 1 mol of the compound

The enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the energies required to break the bonds in the reactants minus the sum of the energies released when the bonds form in the product.

Wait, but how do I approach this without knowing the number of each atom in the molecule? Let me count.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 group has 3 Hs. Let me count the carbons and hydrogens.

The molecule is a diene, maybe? Let's see:

Breaking it down:

- (CH3)2C=CH: that's 3 carbons (two CH3 attached to a C which is double-bonded to another CH).
Wait, perhaps I should draw it out. But since I can't, I'll try to count each part.

Each CH3 group is one C and three Hs. Let's count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: structure is like two CH3 groups attached to a C which is double-bonded to CH.
So the first part has 3 carbons (the central C, two CH3, and the CH). Wait, maybe not. Let's see:

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So it's a chain with double bonds at specific positions.

Breaking down each segment:

- (CH3)2C=CH: this is four carbons? Let me see. The (CH3)2 is two CH3 groups attached to a central C, which is double-bonded to a CH group. So that's 3 carbons (the central C, two from CH3, and one from the CH). Then, the rest is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, maybe it's better to count all the carbons and hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps I can figure out the molecular formula of the compound. Let's see.

Each (CH3) group is CH3, so for each occurrence:

The molecule has:

- The first part: (CH3)2C=CH- → so that's 2*(CH3) = 6 H, 2 C. Then the C is another C, so 3 C in that part, and the CH has 1 C and 1 H. So for that part: 3 C, 7 H.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating. Let's approach it as follows:

Each carbon in the molecule is either in a CH3 group, CH2, CH, or part of a double bond (like C=C).

Alternatively, maybe I should write the molecular formula.

The given formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: that's (CH3)2 (2 carbons, each contributing 3 hydrogens) → 2 C, 6 H. Then the central C (third C) is double-bonded to a CH, which is another C and H. So that's 3 C, 7 H.

Wait, but the structure is (CH3)2C=CH– so maybe it's (CH2CH3) group? No, wait, (CH3)2C is a substituent. Maybe I should consider each group.

Alternatively, perhaps I can break down the entire molecule:

Looking at each segment:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : that's 4 carbons? Wait, no. Let's count each C:

Each (CH3) is a C attached to three H. So the group (CH3)2C is 3 C (two CH3 and one central C). Then the =CH part is another C. So that's 4 C in the first part.

Wait, no, because (CH3)2C is a single C with two CH3 groups attached. Then the C is connected via double bond to another CH group. So that's 3 C so far: 2 from the two CH3 groups and one central C. Then the double bond to a CH (another C). So that's 4 C in the first part.

Then the next part is -CH2-: that's one C with two H.

Then -CH(CH3)-: that's another
