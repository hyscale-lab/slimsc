Okay, so I need to figure out what compound C9H11NO2 is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's start by looking at the options and the data step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So, n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1. So DoU = (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could be three rings, but more likely a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) plus a double bond or an amide group or something else.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. Which N-H? Could be from an amide or an amine. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, maybe an ester or amide or ketone. Ester's carbonyl is around 1720-1740, which fits here. Amide carbonyls are usually around 1680-1700, so maybe it's an ester.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests it's attached to a CH2. The integration is 3H, which fits ethyl.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, broad singlet could be an NH group, but wait, the IR has N-H stretches. But wait, the integration here is 2H, which is a bit odd for a single NH. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group? Or maybe something else. Or perhaps an ethyl group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, if it's an amide, the N-H protons might be exchanging and appear as a broad peak, but the integration is 2H, which doesn't add up because amines or amides typically have one or two protons (like in an amide), but wait, what about if it's a group like -N(CH2...), but that might not fit. Or maybe it's a -CH2N- group. Alternatively, maybe it's the adjacent protons to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests splitting into four, which is usually a -CH2-CH2- group where each CH2 is next to each other. So maybe a -OCH2CH2- group? Or perhaps an ester group where the ethyl is split into a quartet. Wait, but the ethyl's triplet is at 1.20, which would make sense with a quartet at around 4.5. For example, in an ethyl ester, the structure would be OCH2CH3. But wait, the typical ethyl ester would have the -OCH2CH3 as a quartet and triplet. Let me think: the ethyl group in an ester is usually OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3, and the CH3 as a triplet around 1.2-1.4. Wait, but in our data, the quartet is at 4.5 and the triplet is at 1.20. That seems a bit upfield. Maybe it's an ethyl group adjacent to something else, like in a benzamide or something.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the substituents are in the para positions. So perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring, each in para positions, leading to two doublets. Alternatively, the substituents could be in the para position, making it a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. For example, a benzamide group where the amide is at position 4. Or maybe an ethoxy group and an amide group in para positions.

So putting all this together:

The IR suggests an ester (1720 cm-1) and N-H groups (from 3420 and 3325). So perhaps it's an amide or an amine. But wait, the 1H NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0, 2H. If it's an amide, the NH would be broad, but in the 1H NMR, the singlet at 4.0 could be something else. Alternatively, perhaps the NH is exchanging and not showing up? Or maybe the N is part of an amide.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So benzamide would have the amide group, which is CONH2? Wait, no, benzamide is typically an amide where the R is aryl. The structure would be Ar-CONH2. But the formula would be C9H11NO2 for benzamide with ethoxy substitution? Let me check. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (which is C2H5O) would make it C9H11NO3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So, if the starting point is benzamide (C7H7NO2), then adding ethoxy would add C2H5O, so total would be C9H12O3. Hmm, but our compound is C9H11NO2, so that doesn't fit. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are different. Let's think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is OEt attached to benzene at position 3, and the amide is at position 1. So benzamide is PhCONH2. If the ethoxy is at position 3, then the molecule is OEt-Ph-CONH2. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO3 (because Ph is C6H5, OEt is C2H5O, CONH2 is CNO2). So that would be C6 + C2 + C1 = C9, H: 5 (from Ph) +5 (OEt) + H from CONH2? Wait, CONH2 is O2NHC. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would make it C7+2= C9, H:7 +5 =12? Wait, but formula is C9H11NO2. So that would be 3 more H's accounted for. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me calculate molecular formula.

Ph is C6H5. Ethoxy is OCH2CH3 (C2H5O). Benzamide would be PhCONH2 (C7H7NO2). So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the structure OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring in position 3. So the formula would be C6H5-OCH2CH3-CONH2? Or is the CONH2 part attached to the benzene?

Wait, benzamide is Ph-CONH2. So if it's 3-ethoxybenzamide, the structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 (at position 3) and Ph-CONH2 (at position 1). So the entire molecule's formula would be C9H11NO3. Because Ph is C6H5, OCH2CH3 adds C2H5O, and CONH2 adds CONH2. So total C: 6 +
