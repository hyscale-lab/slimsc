Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can break it down.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to possible states. The operator here is P, which has components Px, Py, and Pz given in the problem.

The problem states that the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, the direction is in x-z plane, so the vector n would have components (nx, 0, nz), right? So the general form of the operator along n would be the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Oh wait, because each component of P is ħ/2 times a Pauli matrix. Let me think.

The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So P_x is (ħ/2) σx, P_y is (ħ/2) σy, P_z is (ħ/2) σz. So the operator for direction n would be P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So that would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, n is a unit vector, right? So n_x² + n_z² =1. So substituting the P components: P = (n_x)(ħ/2 σx) + (n_z)(ħ/2 σz) = (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz). 

Alternatively, I can factor out the ħ/2, so the operator is (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_z σz).

But the problem asks for the eigenvector of P when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we need to find a vector |ψ> such that P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Hmm, wait, wait. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and P is (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz), so the equation becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, that would imply that (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>. So the matrix (n_x σx + n_z σz) has an eigenvalue of 1, and the corresponding eigenvector is |ψ>.

Wait, or maybe I'm getting the scaling wrong. Let me think again. The eigenvalue equation is P|ψ> = λ |ψ>. Given that λ is ħ/2, so substituting:

(ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> → (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix equation reduces to (n_x σx + n_z σz) acting on |ψ> equals |ψ>.

But wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So the operator (n_x σx + n_z σz) is a combination of these. To find its eigenvectors, perhaps I should diagonalize it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this operator in terms of the Pauli matrices. Let me represent it as a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute it.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So n_x σx is [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]], and n_z σz is [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z]]. Adding them gives:

[[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]].

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]]. That's the matrix whose eigenvectors we're looking for, with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, no. The equation is (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, but the matrix is [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]], so the equation is:

[n_z a + n_x b, n_x a + (-n_z) b]^T = [a, b]^T.

So this gives two equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0.

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0 → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

Hmm, so these are the two equations we have. Let's write them as:

( (n_z -1) ) a + (n_x) b = 0.

(n_x) a + ( -n_z -1 ) b =0.

Since these are two equations, perhaps they are multiples, which they should be because it's an eigenvalue equation. So let's see if the two equations are multiples.

Let me take the first equation: a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z - 1 ). Let's substitute into the second equation.

n_x [ (-n_x b)/(n_z -1) ) ] + ( -n_z -1 ) b =0.

Multiply through:

[ -n_x^2 b ]/(n_z -1) + ( -n_z -1 ) b =0.

Factor out b:

b [ ( -n_x^2 )/(n_z -1 ) + (-n_z -1) ] =0.

Since b can't be zero (else the vector would be zero, which isn't a valid eigenvector), the term in brackets must be zero.

So ( -n_x^2 )/(n_z - 1 ) + (-n_z -1) )=0.

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1 )=0.

Compute (-n_z -1)(n_z -1):

= (-n_z)(n_z -1) -1 (n_z -1)
= -n_z^2 + n_z -n_z +1
= -n_z^2 + 0 +1
= 1 -n_z^2.

So the equation becomes:

- n_x^2 + (1 -n_z^2) =0 → -n_x^2 +1 -n_z^2 =0 → 1 - (n_x^2 +n_z^2 )=0.

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So 1 -1=0 → 0=0. So the two equations are consistent and dependent, which makes sense.

So from the first equation, a = [ -n_x b ]/(n_z -1 ).

Hmm, but perhaps a better approach would be to parameterize the direction vector n.

Since n is in x-z plane, we can represent it as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z=cosθ.

So the equation becomes:

( (cosθ -1) ) a + (sinθ) b =0.

And the second equation is:

(sinθ) a + (-cosθ -1 ) b =0.

Let me take the first equation:

a = [ -sinθ * b ] / (cosθ -1 ).

But cosθ -1 is -2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So:

a = [ - (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) b ] / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel, and 2 sin(θ/2) cancels from numerator and denominator.

So a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / (2 sin^2(θ/2) ) ) ] * b

Wait, wait, let me recheck:

Denominator is (cosθ -1) = - (1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(θ/2).

Numerator is -sinθ = - 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting:

a = [ (-2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) * b ] / ( -2 sin²(θ/2) )

The negatives cancel, and 2 sin(θ/2) in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving:

a = [ cos(θ/2) ) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ) ] * b → a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] b.

Thus, the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2) → a = (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) b.

Let me write the eigenvector as a two-component vector [a, b]^T.

We can choose b as a parameter, say b=1 for simplicity, then a = cot(θ/2).

But wait, we need to make sure that the vector is normalized. Let me compute |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(θ/2)|^2 +1 = [cos²(θ/2)/sin²(θ/2)] +1 = [ (cos² + sin² ) / sin² ] = 1/sin²(θ/2).

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1/sin²(θ/2)) )= sin(θ/2).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me see:

The vector is [a, b]^T = [ cot(θ/2) , 1 ].

So the squared magnitude is (cot^2 (θ/2) ) + 1 = csc^2 (θ/2) → 1/sin^2 (θ/2).

So to normalize, we multiply by sin(θ/2) → the normalized vector becomes:

[ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), 1 * sin(θ/2) ].

Simplify:

cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), so the first component becomes [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) ] → cos(θ/2).

The second component is sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose θ=0, which would mean n is along the z-axis (n_x=0, n_z=1). Then the eigenvector would
