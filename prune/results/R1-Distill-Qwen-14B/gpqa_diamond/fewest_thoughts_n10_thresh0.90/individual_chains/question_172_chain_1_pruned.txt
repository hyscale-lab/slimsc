Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to think this through. So, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, the problem states that the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. Oh right, so that means we can use the Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature and the energy difference between those states.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -Î”E / (k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. But in this case, the question is about the excitation level, so I think the ratio of the excited states to the ground states is given.

Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So in star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level. Or wait, the wording is "twice as excited", which I think means the ratio n_upper/n_lower is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So n1/n2 = 2, where n is the population ratio.

Wait no, let me clarify. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, perhaps it's that the excitation level (the population of the excited state) is higher in star_1. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state for iron is n1 and n2 respectively. And n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, I think the exact statement is that the excitation is twice as much. So for star_1, the excitation (n_upper) is twice that of star_2. So (n_upper)_1 = 2 * (n_upper)_2? Or is it (n_upper)_1 / (n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper)_2 / (n_lower)_2. That's more likely because the ratio depends on temperature
