Okay, so I have this science question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature through something called the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. Oh wait, excitation here probably refers to the number of atoms in an excited state relative to the ground state. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

I think the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. The formula, if I recall correctly, is the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states. The formula is something like N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

In this case, since the energy difference is given, and assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars (because it's the same transition in the same element), the ratio would simplify. But wait, the question says the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So, for star_1, the ratio N1_upper/N1_lower is twice that of star_2, which is N2_upper/N2_lower.

So let me write that down. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Each R is given by exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), assuming g is the same for both. So R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but wait. No, wait. Because if the atoms are more excited (more in the upper state) when the temperature is higher, right? Because higher temperatures mean more thermal energy, so more atoms can be excited to higher energy levels. So actually, if star_1 has more excited atoms, that suggests T1 is higher than T2.

But wait, the ratio R is N_upper/N_lower. For a higher temperature, N_upper should be higher because more atoms are excited. So for star_1, if R1=2*R2, then R1 is greater than R2, which would mean that exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. Because R = N_upper/N_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So if star_1 has twice as many excited atoms, then R1 = 2 * R2.

So substituting, exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this. So ln(R1) = ln(2 R2) = ln(2) + ln(R2). But R1 is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 is exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). So ln(R1) is -ΔE/(k T1), and ln(R2) is -ΔE/(k T2).

So putting it together: (-ΔE/(k T1)) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Let me rearrange this equation. Let's move the terms around.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k): ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2).

Wait, wait. Let me compute the left side again. The equation after moving terms is:

(-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) = ln(2).

So factoring out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Hmm, that's the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

Because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me check: 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, what's the sign here? Let's see:

Suppose T1 > T2, which we think is the case because star_1 is more excited. So T1 - T2 is positive. So the term [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] is positive. So the left-hand side is (ΔE/k) multiplied by a positive number. The equation is:

(ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but wait, I have to check the signs again. Because when I take the equation:

(-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) = ln(2).

Let me factor out ΔE/(k) from both terms:

ΔE/(k) [ (-1/T1) + (1/T2) ) ] = ln(2).

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Which is also:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) ] = ln(2).

So, the equation becomes (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but wait, that's not one of the options. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) ln(2) = T2/T1.

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2).

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2.

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but in our equation, we have (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So, that's:

(ΔE/(k)) * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

Hmm, but the options don't have this term. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, maybe I should look at the ratio differently. Let me start again. The ratio R1/R2 is 2, because star_1 is twice as excited.

R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So, R1/R2 = 2.

Which becomes exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) = 2.

Because when you divide exponentials, you subtract the exponents. So exp( A ) / exp( B ) = exp( A - B ) = exp( (A) ) * exp( -B ), but wait, no, actually, exp(A)/exp(B) = exp(A - B).

So, in this case, R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2.

Taking natural log of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2).

So, (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

Wait, because 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

But looking at the options, none of them have ΔE or k, so perhaps I can find a way to express (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) in terms of the ratio ln(2) multiplied by something else?

Wait, but the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to get me to recognize that the ratio T1 and T2 relates in a certain way, but perhaps I've made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, another approach: Let's let the ratio R1 = 2 R2. R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

So R1 = 2 R2.

Take ln of both sides:

ln(R1) = ln(2) + ln(R2).

But ln(R1) is -ΔE/(k T1 ), and ln(R2) is -ΔE/(k T2 ).

So:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But again, the options don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the ratio of temperatures.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the temperatures. Let me denote x = T1 and y = T2. So the equation becomes:

(ΔE/k) * (x - y)/(x y) ) = ln(2).

But without knowing ΔE or k, I can't solve for x and y directly. Hmm, but perhaps the question is about the relationship between x and y, not their absolute values.

Wait, but that's not possible because the equation involves x and y in a product and difference. So perhaps the options are missing the constants, but given that, maybe I can't proceed further. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. The problem states that the atoms are twice as excited in star_1. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

But the ratio of the populations is given by N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). If the energy level has the same g for both stars, then that ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So R1 = 2 R2, with R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So,

R1/R2 = 2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is the same as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2.

Taking ln both sides,

(ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm to find an expression that relates T1 and T2 without the constants.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation to express (T1 - T2) in terms of T1 T2.

Wait, let's write the equation again:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

But without knowing ΔE or k, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Wait, but the problem statement says that the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, wait a minute! 1.38e-23 J is actually equal to k (Boltzmann's constant) because k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So, ΔE is given as k, so ΔE = k.

Wait, wait, wait, that can't be right. Because k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k * (1 K). So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So substituting ΔE = k * 1 K into the equation.

The equation becomes:

(k * 1 K) / k * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

Simplifying, that gives:

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

So,

(T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(
