Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully and break it down step by step. Hmm. The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the spots are making the star cooler overall because they are dark, right? They absorb less light, so the effective temperature decreases.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless versus when it has spots.

Wait, the ratio decreases when spots are present. So, when no spots, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower. The question is asking for the factor by which it changes. So, the factor would be (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots), which should be greater than 1 because the ratio goes down when spots are present.

I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy states based on temperature. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, in this problem, the ratio is decreasing when spots are present. So, when the star is cooler (spots present), the ratio is lower. That makes sense because the Boltzmann factor is exponential in temperature. Lower temperatures (denominator in the exponent) would make the exponential term smaller. So, n2/n1 would be smaller when T is lower, assuming E2 > E1. If E2 is higher than E1, then E2 - E1 is positive, so the exponent becomes more negative as T decreases, making the ratio smaller.

But wait, the ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, right? Because the problem says the ratio decreases. Let me think: suppose the two energy levels are level 1 and level 2. If E2 > E1, then when T is higher, the ratio n2/n1 is higher. So when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, which would mean that n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the levels wrong.

Wait, the problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to be lower when the spots are present. Wait, noâ€”it depends on which level is higher. Let me clarify.

Wait, suppose level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. Then, when the temperature is high, more atoms are in the higher level (level 2), so n2 is larger, so n1/n2 would be smaller. But the problem says that when spots are present (lower T), the ratio decreases. Wait, the ratio is (n1/n2) when not considering spots, and when spots are present, it becomes lower. So (n1/n2)_no_spots is higher than (n1/n2)_spots.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T is lower, the exponential factor becomes smaller. So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Let's say E2 > E1. So, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. That would mean that n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which would increase as T decreases, because the exponent becomes positive and larger. Wait, wait, let me get this right.

Let me re-express n1/n2. If n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes larger because T is in the denominator. So, as T decreases, the exponent increases. So, n1/n2 increases. That would mean, when T is lower (spots present), n1/n2 is higher. But according to the problem,
