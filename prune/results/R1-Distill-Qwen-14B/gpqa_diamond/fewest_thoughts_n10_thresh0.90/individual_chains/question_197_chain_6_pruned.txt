Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy yet. But I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is a reagent used for the hydrolysis of esters. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! Red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of esters to form carboxylic acids. So if Compound X is an ester, reacting it with red phosphorus and HI would give the corresponding carboxylic acid.

But before that, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The data given are IR and 1H NMR. Let's start with the IR.

The IR data shows strong peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad region usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually around 2500-3300, but a broad peak. Another possibility is an ester with an OH group, but that doesn't make a lot of sense because esters are usually O-H free. Wait, maybe it's an alcohol. Or perhaps an aldehyde? No, aldehydes have a strong peak around 2820 and 2720 for the C-H stretch in the CHO group, but the given IR doesn't mention those. Hmm.

Looking at the IR, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For esters, this is usually around 1720-1740. So that supports the idea that X is an ester. Because if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but maybe a bit lower. Also, the 3400-2500 cm-1 might be from an alcohol if it's an ester with a neighboring group. Or maybe it's an acidic proton elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the ester is part of a benzene ring, like a benzoate ester. That makes sense because the NMR has signals that look like aromatic protons.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a pretty high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. But wait, if X is an ester, the 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde H. But wait, after hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI, it would form a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but the product might not have an aldehyde.

Wait, but wait. If X is an ester, then the 10.5 ppm peak doesn't fit. Esters typically don't have protons that high unless it's an aldehyde group, which is a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a phenolic OH. But phenolic protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, but maybe in some cases like if it's deprotonated, but that's unlikely in the NMR as shown.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. IR has 3400-2500, which is a broad region, often O-H. So maybe the compound has a hydroxyl group. But if it's an ester, that might not make sense. Or wait, perhaps it's an ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group, like a glycol ester? Or maybe it's a ketone? No, because the 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone, but a ketone's O-H would be different.

Wait, maybe the 3400-2500 is from an aldehyde's C-H stretch? No, aldehydes have two peaks: one around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 for the two C-H stretches. The given IR doesn't have those, so maybe that's not it.

Hmm. Let me look at the NMR more closely. At 8.0 ppm, a doublet (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm, another doublet (d, 2H). That looks like two sets of doublets which are probably para-substituted aromatic protons. So the aromatic ring has substituents in the para positions. The 8.0 ppm is higher shift, which suggests electron-withdrawing groups, like a carbonyl, maybe a nitro group, or an ester group attached.

Wait, but if it's an ester attached to the ring, that would be a carbonyl group. So perhaps the ring has an ester substituent, as in a benzene ring with an ester group.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets. For a para-substituted benzene with another substituent, perhaps it's a disubstituted ring. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions. So for example, if there's an ester group in the para position, and perhaps another group in the ortho or meta? Wait, but the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe the ring has two substituents in the para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with an ester group and another group, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the other NMR peaks.

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These look like a chain of carbons. The 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H suggests a CH3 group attached to something that splits the peak into a doublet. A common scenario is a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH. For example, in an isobutyl group.

Wait, let's see: 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is probably a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two adjacent CH2 groups, but wait, 2H as a multiplet suggests maybe a -CH2-CH2- group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 connected to a CH and another CH2.

Wait, another approach: maybe it's a propyl group. Let's see the integration: 1H (2.9), 2H (1.7), 3H (1.4), and 3H (0.9). Wait, that sums up to 1+2+3+3=9? No, wait, the 1.4 is 3H and the 0.9 is 3H as well. So perhaps it's a chain like CH2-CH2-CH3, but the 1.4 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? Or maybe a -CH2-CH2-CH2- but that doesn't fit the 1.4 d or the 2.9 m.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me think. The 1.4 ppm d (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is connected to another group. The 1.7 ppm m (2H) could be a -CH2-CH- structure. So maybe it's (CH2)2CHCH3, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl chain where the middle CH is split into a triplet or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a secondary butyl group. Let me think about the integration. The 2.9 ppm is 1H, which could be a methylene between two CH2 groups, but that might not fit. Alternatively, it's a CH group connected to another CH2 and a CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) structure? Or maybe an isobutyl group.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm t suggests a terminal CH2CH2CH3. So 3H as a triplet at 0.9 ppm, meaning it's a CH2CH2CH3 group attached to another CH2. So perhaps like -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would have the CH2 groups in the middle. Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H) which suggests a CH2CH3 attached to something that splits into a doublet. Oh wait, the 1.4 is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to something else.

Putting it together: the 0.9 ppm triplet is a CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl group). The 1.4 ppm doublet is a CH3 attached to a CH. Then the 1.7 ppm multiplet is two H's on a CH2 adjacent to the CH. The 2.9 ppm is a CH group, perhaps connected to the aromatic ring. So the structure could be a benzene ring with an ester group (from the IR carbonyl) and a substituent that's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent like O-CO-O-R, but wait, esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'.

Wait, but if X is an ester, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let's try to piece together the structure of X.

The aromatic ring is para-substituted, as indicated by the NMR. So there are two substituents in the para positions. One substituent might be the ester group, and the other substituent could be a chain.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The aromatic NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which suggests that the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each causing the aromatic protons to split into doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho positions, but that's less likely since the coupling would be different.

Wait, another approach: look at the options. The options are A to D, and the question is asking for the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which is hydrolysis of ester to carboxylic acid.

Let me look at the options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached to a phenyl ring.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl in the positions.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in position 4.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So a toluene with a sec-butyl group and methyl in position 4.

Wait, but the product after hydrolysis would be a carboxylic acid. So looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids. The other options are aromatics with substituents but not acids.

So if X is an ester, then the product would be the corresponding acid. So our product is either A or C.

So let's think about what X would be before hydrolysis.

If the product is option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, that would mean X was the ester form, like ethyl 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoate.

Alternatively, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So X would have been the ester form, like sec-butyl benzoate.

So let's try to determine which one it is.

Looking back at the NMR of X.

In the aromatic region, the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. For benzoate esters, the aromatic protons would typically be deshielded if there's an electron-withdrawing group like the ester. So the para-substituted ester would cause the adjacent protons to be downfield.

In the case of a benzoate ester (like phenyl acetate), the aromatic protons would be in the range of 7.5-8.5 ppm, depending on substitution. The substituent (ester group) would cause the adjacent protons to be more deshielded.

If the ester is in the para position, then the two adjacent protons (ortho) would be a pair, and the two meta would be another pair. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests that the substituent is in the para position, leading to two sets of equivalent protons.

So if the ester is in the para position, then the two ortho protons would be equivalent, and the two meta protons would be equivalent. But wait, in that case, the ortho and meta would each have their own shifts. But in the NMR, we see two doublets, 8.0 and 7.2, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the substituent is in the para position, making the ortho and meta each a pair.

Wait, but that would require the substituent to be a strong de-shielder. Let me think about the NMR shifts. The 8.0 ppm is more deshielded than 7.2, so perhaps the ortho protons are at 8.0 and the meta at 7.2. That makes sense if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group in the para position.

So if the ester is in the para position, the ortho protons would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than the meta. That fits with the NMR data.

So now, looking at the aliphatic region of the NMR of X. Let's see:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is likely a CH group adjacent to other CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to the CH, and the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH (like a CH(CH3)).

Then the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group. So the aliphatic chain seems to be: CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Let me draw it out.

A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but our NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which would correspond to the CH2CH2CH3 end. So perhaps the chain is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each peak:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): likely a CH2CH2CH3 group. So the end of a chain, like -CH2CH2CH3.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 group attached to a CH. So something like -CH(CH3)-.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two H's on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group connected to other CH2 groups.

Putting it all together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group (O-CO-O-) and a substituent that's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps it's more like a benzyl ester with a substituent on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: think about the
