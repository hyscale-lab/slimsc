Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, which are various organic compounds. I need to first figure out what Compound X is, based on the given IR and NMR data, and then determine what happens when it reacts under those conditions.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. I know that the 3400-2500 region is usually indicative of O-H or N-H stretches, but since there's no mention of amines here, I'll think O-H. The broad peak might suggest an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but wait, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very broad and strong, often around 2500-3000, but the 3400–2500 cm-1 might be an alcohol or maybe an aldehyde. Hmm, but wait, another possibility is that it's a conjugated system.

Wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. That's a good indicator. 1720 is usually a carbonyl group. In a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700-1800 cm⁻¹, so that fits. But wait, if it's a ketone, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. Wait, 1720 could be a ketone or an ester. Also, I should note other peaks. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are probably aromatic C=C stretching. Those are around 1450-1600 cm-1, so that suggests an aromatic ring, maybe with substituents.

Now the 1H NMR data. Let's parse that:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet. That's probably an -
