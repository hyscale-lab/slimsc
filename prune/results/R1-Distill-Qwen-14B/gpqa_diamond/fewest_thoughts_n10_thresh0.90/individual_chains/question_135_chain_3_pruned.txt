Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decays, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X, given its mass and the interaction Lagrangian. Let's break it down.

First, the problem says the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. I remember that the mass of a particle determines what it can decay into, because the total energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the original particle. So whatever X decays into must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, okay, so this looks like an interaction term between the boson X and fermions. I think the ψ_f represents fermion fields. The term suggests that X interacts with fermions because it's in the Lagrangian as part of the interaction. The fermions involved are probably those that have a Yukawa coupling with X. The v is likely the vacuum expectation value (VEV), which is part of the Higgs mechanism, but maybe that's not super relevant for this problem.

So, looking at the Lagrangian, it's of the form λ X ψ̄ ψ, which usually implies a Yukawa interaction. Yukawa couplings determine how the boson (here, X) interacts with fermions. So, X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the interaction allows it. But which fermions can it decay into?

I think the key here is that X must have a non-zero coupling to the fermions it decays into. So, the allowed decay products are the fermions that the X field interacts with as per the Lagrangian.

Looking at the options, they all involve various fermion pairs. So for each option, I need to figure out which fermions are possible decay products.

Wait, but the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Also, each fermion must have a mass less than half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV, because in decay, each product's mass must be less than half the parent mass if you're considering rest frame.

Wait, no. For decay, the individual particles' rest mass must be less than the parent's mass divided by two. Because in the rest frame, the decay products must each have energy at least equal to their rest mass energy. So for a fermion pair, each fermion's mass must be less than X's mass divided by 2. So 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV. Any fermion with a rest mass less than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

So let's list the known fermion masses. Let me recall:

Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
Up (u), Down (d): u is around 2.2 MeV, d is about 4.7 MeV (so way below 3 GeV)
Strange (s): ~95 MeV (also way below)
Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

So, any fermion with mass <3 GeV. So, e, μ, τ, u, d, s, and c. But wait, the b quark is a problem because its mass is about 4.5 GeV. Half of 6 GeV is 3 GeV, so the b quark is heavier than 3 GeV, so X cannot decay into b quarks because each would require at least 4.5 GeV, but 4.5 + 4.5 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So, X can't decay into b bbar.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, because the decay products must be two fermions. The total mass of the two fermions must be less than X's mass (6 GeV). So, for fermions f, the sum of their rest masses must be less than 6 GeV. So, for a pair like b bbar, each b is ~4.5 GeV, so 4.5 * 2 =9 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So, that's not allowed. So X cannot decay into b bbar.

But wait, is that correct? Because when a particle decays, the energy available isn't just the rest mass; it's the entire mass of the parent. So, for example, in the rest frame of X, the total energy is 6 GeV. Each decay product (fermion pair) must have a combined energy of 6 GeV, but their rest mass must be less than that. So, the actual condition is that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products should be less than or equal to the mass of X.

Wait, but wait, the condition is more precise. The rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of X, considering that they're produced at rest (but that's in the simplest case).

Wait, no, more accurately, the condition is that the invariant mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the parent. But since we're considering two-body decay (assuming that), the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to the parent's mass.

In case of X → f fbar, the invariant mass is the same as the sum of their rest masses only in the rest frame. Wait, no. Let me think. For two-body decay, the minimal energy each fermion needs is their rest mass. So, in the rest frame of X, each fermion will have energy E = (m_X^2 + m_f^2 )/(2 m_X). The momentum is sqrt( (E)^2 - (m_f)^2 ), but that's not the main point.

The condition for decay is that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the parent's mass. So, for X → f fbar, the sum of the two fermion masses must be ≤ m_X.

Wait, each fermion has mass m_f, so 2*m_f ≤ m_X. Because if each is m_f, then 2*m_f ≤ m_X. So, m_f ≤ m_X/2.

So, for X at 6 GeV, m_f must be ≤3 GeV.

So, looking at the fermions:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → okay
- μ: ~0.105 → okay
- τ: ~1.78 → okay
- u: ~2.2 MeV → okay
- d: ~4.7 MeV → okay
- s: ~95 MeV → okay
- c: ~1.275 GeV → okay
- b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 *2=9 GeV >6, so no.

Wait, but if X can decay into a pair of fermions, each with m_f ≤ 3 GeV. So, any fermion lighter than 3 GeV would allow X → f fbar.

So, what fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV? All except top quark (which is way too heavy), and bottom quark (~4.5 GeV, which is just over 3 GeV).

So, possible fermion pairs are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the allowed decay channels, which depend on whether X couples to those fermions. Because the Lagrangian has ψ_f as the fermion fields. So, the interaction term is present only for the fermions that are in ψ_f.

Looking back at the Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, the fermions involved in the interaction are the ones that ψ_f represents. So which fermions are included in this term?

Wait, the problem says that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So, X interacts with the fermions f that are present in ψ_f. So, for X to decay into f fbar, it needs to have a non-zero coupling λ. So, the question is, which fermions are included in ψ_f?

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, ψ_f is the field for fermion f. So, the interaction is between X and all the fermions f for which this Lagrangian term exists. So, the problem is that X can decay into any fermion f for which this term is present.

But the problem doesn't specify which fermions f are included. Hmm, but the problem is about the kinematically allowed decays. So, perhaps in this case, the interaction is with all possible fermions, but the mass of X limits which decays are allowed.

Wait, no, because X can only decay into fermions that it interacts with. So,
