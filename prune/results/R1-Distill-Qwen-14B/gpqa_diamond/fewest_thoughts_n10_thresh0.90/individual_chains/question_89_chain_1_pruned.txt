Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I'm trying to remember what happens when dibrominated compounds react with a strong base like KOH. Oh wait, that's probably an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a vicinal dihalide on an adamantane ring) are treated with a strong base, you get an elimination to form an alkene. Because the base is in excess and heated, it's likely an E2 mechanism. So the product 1 should be 1,3-adamantadiene, but wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate to form 1,3-adamantadiene, but I think the correct structure is that the double bonds are between carbons 1 and 2, and 3 and 4 or something, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diene. But the question mentions the product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense for an alkene, maybe a diene. 

Looking at the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Hmm. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that's a carbonyl group. But wait, product 1 comes from KOH and 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Another possibility is that the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but if that were the case, the product would be an alkene, which wouldn't have a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm mixing this up. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, KOH is a strong base, but sometimes in such conditions, it can lead to elimination. Wait, but if we have two adjacent Br atoms, that's a good setup for elimination. So perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene. But then why is the IR showing a carbonyl? Oh wait, maybe I'm misremembering. No, wait, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (like a ketone or ester). So maybe elimination isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH under certain conditions, could undergo a substitution. But wait, if KOH is a strong base and the conditions are high temperature, elimination is more likely. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this all wrong. Another option: perhaps it's a ring-opening or some kind of addition. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But if that were the case, with two Br atoms, maybe it's a double substitution. But then, if two substitutions happen, perhaps forming an oxide or something else.

Wait, wait, I think I need to rethink. KOH is a strong base, and heating with a dibromide. Vicinal dihalides with strong bases typically eliminate to form alkenes. So product 1 should be an alkene. But the IR has a carbonyl, which suggests a ketone. Hmm, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the product isn't an alkene. Wait, perhaps the base isn't just deprotonating but also causing some kind of ring-opening. 

Wait, let's think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on specific positions. When KOH is added, perhaps it's undergoing a double elimination, forming a diene, which would explain the IR. Wait, but dienes don't have carbonyl groups. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something here. 

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the product is an epoxide. But wait, how would that happen? Epoxides are typically formed from dihalides with a peracid, not KOH. Alternatively, maybe it's a diepoxide? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. If KOH is a nucleophile, maybe it substitutes the bromine atoms. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's forming a geminal diol? But that's for vicinal dihalides, but KOH in such conditions would more likely eliminate. Hmm. This is confusing. 

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's typical for a ketone (around 1700-1750). So product 1 must have a ketone group. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Oh! Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, but I thought that's more like when a dihalide loses two equivalents to form a carbonyl. Oh wait, I think I remember something about the formation of ketones from dihalides. For example, when 2-bromopropane (CH2CH2Br) is treated with KOH, you get elimination to form propene. But that's a mono-halide. Hmm. 

Wait, but in some cases, dihalides can undergo dehalogenation. Wait, but that's when they lose two halides, maybe to form a double bond. But the presence of a carbonyl suggests a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an intramolecular attack. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein elimination or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a substitution where the base deprotonates and forms a bridge, but that doesn't directly lead to a ketone. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another angle. The NMR data. Product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's usually a singlet for CH2 groups, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, if it's a ketone, where would the CH2 be? Or perhaps it's an OCH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2. But wait, the 4.79 ppm is around where an ether or an alcohol's OCH2 or CH2O would appear. Alternatively, if it's a carbonyl group, perhaps that's the ketone, but the 4.79 would be from something else. 

Wait, another thought: Maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide. Because epoxides have O in the ring, and their neighboring protons usually show up around 3-4 ppm. But the 4.79 is higher, perhaps for an OCH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol. But if it's a diol, then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but the product is a conjugated diene. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. 

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, so the initial reaction must have formed a carbonyl group. How? Well, maybe it's a halogen exchange or some kind of oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless the conditions cause oxidation. Wait, but under heating with KOH, perhaps a gem-dibromide can eliminate to form a ketone. Oh! Wait, I think I remember that. When a vicinal dihalide is treated with a strong base, say in alcoholic KOH, it can eliminate to form a double bond. But wait, if the two halides are on adjacent carbons and the base abstracts a proton from one, leading to elimination of HX and forming a double bond. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, that's a vicinal dihalide? Wait, 1 and 3 are not adjacent carbons. Oh wait, no, wait. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure—so the positions 1 and 3 would be on adjacent carbons, perhaps. Because in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to two adjacent bridgeheads. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: product 1 is formed by heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. The IR shows a carbonyl, so product 1 is a ketone. So how does that happen from a dihalide? Oh wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but how? 

Wait a second, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. For example, if you have two adjacent Br atoms, each elimination would lose HBr and form a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone. So that doesn't fit the IR. 

Wait, perhaps the base isn't just eliminating HBr but abstracting a β-hydrogen to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require the Br to be in a position that allows for such elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. For example, each Br is substituted by a hydroxide, forming a diol. But then, under what conditions would that diol lose water to form a ketone? Maybe if the diol is a vicinal diol, it can undergo elimination to form a double bond, but that would require acid conditions, not base. Or perhaps under heat, it could dehydrate. Wait, but the initial reaction is with KOH, which is a base. 

Wait, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the NMR. For product 1: 

- 4.79 ppm (2H): maybe an OCH2 group. 
- 2.41-2.23 (10H): that's a lot, probably from the adamantane structure. The adamantane core has a lot of CH2 groups, which usually appear around 1.5-2 ppm, but if they're near electronegative groups (like oxygen), they might shift up. The 10H suggests it's a decalin-like structure or something similar. 
- 1.94 (2H): perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl or oxygen.

The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl, likely a ketone. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantanone. How? Because when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen leading to the elimination of two equivalents of HBr and forming a ketone. Wait, but wait, if it's a dihalide, eliminating two HBr would form a ketone. Oh wait, that makes sense! 

Wait, vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromoethane) when treated with a strong base can eliminate to form alkenes. But if the dihalide is a geminal dihalide (like 1,1-dibromoethane), elimination would form a carbonyl. So in our case, the dihalide is vicinal, but perhaps the structure allows for the elimination of two HBr to form a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a geminal dihalide. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a simple elimination. Maybe it's a double elimination, but the way the molecule is structured allows for the formation of
