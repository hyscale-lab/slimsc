Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromines on adjacent carbons in that structure. Then, when heated with excess KOH, it probably undergoes a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an E2 elimination. Since there are two bromines, perhaps two eliminations happen.

The product is a light yellow solid. Hmm. The NMR data might help. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) which is probably an -OH group, but wait, wait, no, because KOH would deprotonate it. Or maybe it's an ether, but wait, the IR absorption is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. So maybe the product is a ketone.

Wait, let me think. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it's likely forming an epoxide? No, wait, no, because 1,3-dibromoadamantane doesn't have the right structure for that. Alternatively, when treated with a strong base like KOH, an elimination reaction occurs. Since we have two bromines on adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 3 in adamantane might be adjacent?), the base could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But since there are two adjacent Br atoms, maybe it's a double elimination, forming a larger ring or a more substituted double bond.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH could lead to the formation of an adamantyl oxide. Wait, no, maybe it's forming an epoxide via an E2 mechanism. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But wait, where would the carbonyl come from?

Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely that the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, and when KOH is used, it abstracts a hydrogen leading to a double bond, but since there are two Br atoms, perhaps it forms an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxide is a three-membered ring. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is similar to 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, but in adamantane.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form 1,3-adamantanediene? No, wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a more substituted double bond.

Wait, the product after KOH is a ketone because the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl. So maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanone? Or perhaps the product is a diketone. Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Oh wait, that's not typical for a carbonyl. Unless those are two equivalent protons adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is an epoxide. But the IR doesn't show the typical epoxide C-O-C stretch, which is around 1250-1050 cm⁻¹. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is much higher, so more likely a ketone.

So, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a double bond, but where would that carbon come from? Wait, let's think about the product. The NMR has 4.79 ppm, which is a high field for protons. Typically, protons near carbonyls are around δ 2-3, but maybe in this case, it's something else.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH is 4.79 ppm for 2H. That might be an -OCH2- group, but wait, the IR is 1720, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a Dieckmann condensation or some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination. Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, the two bromides undergo elimination, each losing HBr, forming a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that. But wait, the product is a solid, and the IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak at 1720.

Wait, maybe the starting material is actually 1,3-dibromo-1-adamantanol? No, the question doesn't say that. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's imagine that the two bromines are on carbons that, upon elimination, form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond, but with two Br atoms, perhaps this leads to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't make a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR. 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. For example, if it's an -OCH2- group, but then the IR should show O-H stretch or C-O-C. Alternatively, it's a CH2 adjacent to an carbonyl.

Wait, if the product is a diketone, then maybe the two carbonyls are formed. But then what would the NMR look like? Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane.

Wait, but the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H—maybe that's a CH2 group attached to oxygen, like an ether. Then the IR at 1720 would imply a carbonyl elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the product after KOH. Maybe it's not a ketone but an epoxide. Wait, an epoxide would have a different NMR. The 4.79 ppm could be the epoxide protons, which are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm as a triplet or a quartet depending on the substitution.

Wait, but the IR would show the C-O-C stretch, which is around 1250 cm⁻¹. The given IR is 1720, which is a strong peak for a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone after elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product after KOH is 1-adamantanol, but that doesn't explain the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol. But I'm not making progress here. Let me think again.

The problem says the product is a light yellow solid. Light yellow solids could be ketones, like camphor, or perhaps epoxides. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an adamantyl peroxide. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the IR of 1720 cm⁻¹ is strong for a carbonyl. So the product after KOH is a ketone. How?

1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination of HBr would form a double bond. Wait, but maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl. How? Elimination reactions typically form alkenes, not ketones, unless it's a conjugate elimination or some rearrangement.

Wait! Maybe the structure is such that when two HBr molecules are eliminated, a carbonyl group is formed. For instance, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromocyclohexane, elimination would form cyclohexene, but that's not a ketone. So perhaps in adamantane's structure, the elimination leads to a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more like a pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement involves 1,2-diols losing water to form a carbonyl. But in this case, we have two bromides. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, but with the structure of adamantane, which is a polycyclic structure, leading to a more stable carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product after KOH is 1,3-diketone. So, let's say the product is 1,3-adamantanedione. But then the NMR would show protons adjacent to the ketones.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 4.79 ppm (2H)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H)
- 1.94 (2H)

So, 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet because the integration is 2H. So perhaps it's a methylene group (CH2) attached to something deshielded.

Wait, if it's a ketone, perhaps the 2H are part of a bridge or a ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is a methylene adjacent to oxygen. Like an epoxide. But then the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product after KOH is a diol. But that doesn't explain the IR carbonyl.

Wait, I'm stuck on the first part. Let's think about the next steps. The product (product 1) is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's reacting in some way.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. When you heat a ketone with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of enol ether formation? Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 would need to be an acyl chloride for that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and the Al(OiPr)3 is used for ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, product 1's NMR has 10H between 2.41 and 2.23 ppm. That looks like it's from the adamantane structure, perhaps the bridgehead protons or equivalent positions.

The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, maybe near some substituents.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some rearrangement or forms an enol ether. Alternatively, maybe the Al(OiPr)3 is used to form a more reactive species.

Wait, but wait. Product 2 is then treated with ozone. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3, it forms an epoxide via acid-catalyzed cyclization. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an enone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 undergoes elimination to form a conjugated diene or a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, and upon heating, it rearranges.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think more about the ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis is usually done on alkenes. When O3 is bubbled through a solution of a compound containing a double bond, it cleaves the double bond. The work-up (like with dimethyl sulfide) typically leads to the formation of carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond. So product 2 is an alkene.

So putting it all together: product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form product 2, which is an alkene. Then ozonolysis of product 2 forms product 3, which has carbonyl groups.

So, let's backtrack. Product 1 is the product of 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Since KOH is a base, and product 1 has a carbonyl (IR 1720), product 1 is likely a ketone. Then, product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps leading to an enol formation, which upon elimination forms an alkene (product 2). Then ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, product 2 is an alkene derived from product 1.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. How does a ketone form an alkene upon treatment with a Lewis acid? Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and the Lewis acid induces some kind of ring-opening to form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and the Lewis acid helps in a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the Lewis acid induces elimination to form an alkene. But product 1's IR has a carbonyl, so it's not a diol.

Hmm.

Let me try to think of the reactions in order.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (carbonyl, IR 1720; NMR has 4.79 ppm 2H, which might be
