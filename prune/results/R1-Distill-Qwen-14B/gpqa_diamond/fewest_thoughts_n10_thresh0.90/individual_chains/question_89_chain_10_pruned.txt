Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, right? So the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which means the bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons, I think? Or wait, no, wait. The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent faces, but maybe not directly next to each other. Hmm, but when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, heating with KOH would likely cause an E2 elimination, forming a double bond.

So the product 1 would be an adamantyl compound with a double bond. Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That seems like a triplet, which could be from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an epoxide. Wait, no, because after elimination, you'd get an alkene. Oh wait, perhaps it's a diol? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be from a carbonyl group or an ester, but wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, but if the reaction is elimination, perhaps it's forming an alkene. But the NMR doesn't show any triplets from vinylic protons, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. Wait, KOH is a strong base, but in such a rigid structure, elimination is more likely. So the product would be adamantane with a double bond.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but rather something else. Let me think again. Perhaps, no, KOH in such conditions would more likely cause elimination for vicinal dihalides. Wait, but wait, perhaps the structure is such that elimination isn't possible, so maybe it's a substitution. But that would require a good leaving group and a possible mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the dihalide reacts with KOH in a way that forms an epoxide. Because for some structures, especially if the two leaving groups are on adjacent carbons and in positions that allow for a cyclic transition state, an epoxide could form. Epoxide formation via a double elimination with two equivalents of base. So the product 1 would be an epoxide.

If that's the case, the NMR would show a triplet around 4.79 ppm, which is typical for an epoxide's CH2, as each H is adjacent to two H in the neighboring CH2. Wait, but let me think: in an epoxide, each CH2 group is adjacent to each other. So each CH2 would have two Hs. The coupling between the two CH2 groups would lead to a triplet. So each H in one CH2 is next to two Hs in the adjacent CH2, and perhaps coupled with their own two Hs. Wait, actually, for an epoxide, each CH2 group's Hs are adjacent to the other CH2. So the splitting would be a triplet, because each H is next to two Hs in the neighboring group. So the 4.79 ppm peak as a triplet for 2H would fit that.

So product 1 is an epoxide, 1,3-adamantanediol epoxide? Not sure of the exact name, but it's an epoxide ring formed from the dihalide.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Hmm, what's that reagent used for? Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is an epoxide. So perhaps the epoxide is undergoing ring-opening under these conditions. In the presence of a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, epoxides can undergo ring-opening via a carbocation mechanism.

So when an epoxide ring opens with a Lewis acid, the more substituted carbocation is formed. If the epoxide is in an adamantane structure, which is highly bridged, the ring opening would form a carbocation at the more stable position. So perhaps in this case, it's a ring-opening to form a carbocation, which then could undergo some reaction, maybe trapping with a nucleophile. But the question says it's heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, so perhaps the ring opens, and then maybe another reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is acylated or something else.

Wait, but if product 1 is an epoxide, heating with Al isopropoxide might lead to a ring-opening. How? For example, in acid-catalyzed ring-opening, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making the ring more electrophilic, leading to attack by a nucleophile. But in this case, there's excess Al isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid. So maybe the epoxide oxygen gets coordinated to the Al, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic.

So the epoxide ring would open, forming a carbocation, perhaps. Let's think about the structure of the epoxide. The original molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so when the epoxide forms, it's between the 1 and 3 positions. When it opens, which carbon would get the positive charge? It depends on the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so the 1,3 positions are adjacent. So when the epoxide ring opens, perhaps the carbocation forms in a position that's most stable.

But adamantane's structure is such that carbocations are very stable because of the bridge structure. So the ring opening would lead to a bridged carbocation, which is quite stable.

Wait, but in the case of the epoxide, when it opens, the more substituted carbon would be the one that can better stabilize the positive charge. So in the product 1, when it's an epoxide, the two carbons are each connected to two other carbons in the adamantane structure. So each of the carbons in the epoxide is already highly substituted, so either would be equally likely to form the carbocation? Hmm, maybe.

So after the ring opens, perhaps the next step is the attack by a nucleophile. But in the presence of Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps the ring opens and the carbocation is formed, but without a strong nucleophile, maybe nothing happens. Wait, but the product is heated with excess Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is treated with Al isopropoxide to form a more complex structure.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is treated with Al isopropoxide to form an acylium ion or something else. Alternatively, wait, perhaps the epoxide is undergoing some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, such as ring-opening followed by rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the epoxide ring opening leads to the formation of a ketone. Because if the ring opens and a carbonyl group is formed. Oh! Wait, think about the pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol (geminal diol) under acid conditions rearranges to a carbonyl compound. But in this case, product 1 is an epoxide, not a diol. Wait, but perhaps if the epoxide is opened in a certain way, it could form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is treated in a way to form a carbonyl via a different mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the aluminum isopropoxide isn't acting as a catalyst but is participating in some way. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this step. Let me think again.

Wait, product 1 is an epoxide, which when heated with Al isopropoxide forms product 2. Another possibility: perhaps the epoxide is undergoing acid-catalyzed ring-opening to form a diol. But that's more typical of aqueous acid, not a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is being deprotonated and something else is happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is being treated with a Lewis acid to form a more substituted structure. Wait, but I'm not recalling any specific reaction that would lead to product 2 from an epoxide and Al isopropoxide. Maybe I should think about the next step to get a better idea.

The next step is ozonolysis. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments. But the product after ozonolysis is product 3, and the question is about the NMR of product 3.

Wait, so product 2 must have a double bond that would be cleaved by ozonolysis. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

Wait, let me recap the previous steps:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (epoxide) via KOH elimination.

Product 1 (epoxide) → product 2 via treatment with Al isopropoxide.

Then product 2 is ozonolyzed to product 3.

So product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis targets double bonds.

So perhaps when product 1 (epoxide) is treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes ring-opening to form a diol, which is then dehydrated to form an alkene. But wait, if product 1 is an epoxide,
