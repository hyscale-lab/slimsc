Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So, I'm thinking this has to do with electric potential energy because we're dealing with charges and their configuration. Since the system is isolated, maybe I should consider the potential energy between all the charges.

Wait, the problem says it's the minimum energy. Oh, right! For a system of point charges, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as close together as possible. But wait, in this case, 12 charges are fixed at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So, the configuration is fixed; they can't move closer because they're constrained. So I don't have to figure out the arrangement that minimizes the energy, because it's fixed.

So all I need to do is calculate the potential energy of this setup. How do I do that?

Potential energy for a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them. For each pair of charges, you calculate the potential energy and sum them all up.

But wait, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But since there are multiple charges, I'll need to calculate the potential energy each charge contributes to the others and sum them all.

Wait, but the charge at point P is fixed, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away. So all the 12 are at the same distance from the 13th charge. So perhaps I can compute the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and then also the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, right. The total potential energy U_total is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, there are two types of interactions here: between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and between each pair of the 12 charges.

So, let me break it down.

First, the fixed charge at P (let's call it charge Q) has a charge of 2e. Each of the 12 charges is also 2e and located 2 meters away from P. So, the potential energy between Q and each of the 12 is U_single = k * (2e)*(2e)/(2m).

Wait, no, wait. The distance is 2 meters, so r=2 m. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy due to the fixed charge is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). But wait, wait, the formula for potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. So for each of the 12 charges,
