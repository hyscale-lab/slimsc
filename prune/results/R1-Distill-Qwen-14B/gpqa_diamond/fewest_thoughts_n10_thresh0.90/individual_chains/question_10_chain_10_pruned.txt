Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through each option step by step.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So the formula is density = mass/volume. Volume is tricky because it depends on the radius, and the radius changes with the cube of the radius if the mass and radius scale differently.

Looking at option a: It's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So a planet with Earth's mass and radius would have the same density as Earth. But wait, the question is about which is the highest, so I'll keep that in mind.

Option b: The planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's the same density as Earth. So if it's twice as massive but same density, the volume must be twice Earth's. Because density is mass over volume, so if density is the same, mass is proportional to volume. So if mass is 2 Earth masses, volume would be 2 Earth volumes. Since volume scales with radius cubed, the radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. So this planet is bigger than Earth but same density. So not higher than Earth's density.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive. Same composition means same density, right? Because density depends on the material. Wait, no. Wait, if it's same composition, then if the planet is larger, but if it's scaled up in mass, but same density, then volume would be 5 times as much. So let's see: if Earth is mass M, radius R, then this planet is 5M. So if same density, volume would be 5 times Earth's. But since volume scales with R³, R would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. So this planet is bigger but same density as Earth. So density is same as Earth, which is 5.5. So same as Earth, not higher.

Wait, but wait, the question is about which has the highest density. So all these are same as Earth's density except maybe one.

Wait, no, let me think again. Option c says same composition, which I thought implies same density. So same as Earth's, so 5.5. So same as option a and b.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. So same composition, same density. So same 5.5. So all options except maybe a have 5.5? Wait, no, option a is Earth's, same as Earth, so same density.

Wait, but I'm probably missing something. Let me re-examine each option.

Option a) Earth-mass and radius. So density is 5.5.

Option b) 2 Earth masses, density 5.5. So same as Earth's. So same density as a.

Option c) 5 times Earth's mass, same composition. So same density as Earth. So 5.5.

Option d) half Earth's mass, same composition. So same density as Earth. 5.5.

Wait, but that can't be right because the question is asking which has the highest density. All would have the same. But
