Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about meson resonances and their mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that when particles like mesons are produced, they don't live forever; they decay over time. The mean decay distance would depend on how long they live on average and how fast they're moving.

The question gives me some specific values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Wait, the width usually relates to the particle's lifetime, right? Because a larger width means a shorter lifetime because the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, so if Γ is the width (which is the uncertainty in energy), then Δt is ħ/(Γ). 

So the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. Once I have τ, I need to find the mean speed v of the meson. Then the mean decay distance would be v multiplied by τ. But wait, how do I find v?

I think I should start by computing the total energy E. The production energy is given as 8 GeV. The mass-energy of the meson is m_X c², but since the units are in GeV, maybe I can ignore the c² part because it's already accounted for. So the kinetic energy would be E - m_X c². Wait, but E is the total energy, right? So E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So to find the velocity, I can use the relation between energy and velocity. The momentum p is sqrt( (E c)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c. Wait, let me get that right. Oh, right, the formula is p = sqrt( (E^2) - (m c^2)^2 ) / (c^2). Or maybe I should think in terms of beta and gamma factors. 

Alternatively, beta (β) is v/c, and γ is 1/sqrt(1 - β²). The total energy E is γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). Let me compute γ first.

Given E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667. 

Then, since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), I can solve for β. Let's write that down:

γ² = 1 / (1 - β²) → 1 - β² = 1/γ² → β² = 1 - 1/γ².

So plugging in γ=6.6667, which is 20/3. So 1/γ² is (3/20)^2 = 9/(400) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So β² is 0.9775, so β is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, which is about 0.9887c. So the velocity is approximately 0.9887c.

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute this more accurately. Let me do that:

γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

So γ squared is (6.6666667)^2 = 44.4444444.

So 1/γ² is 1/44.4444444 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775.

Calculating sqrt(0.9775): Let's think. 0.988^2 is 0.976144. Wait, 0.988 * 0.988 = let's compute: 988 * 988. Let's compute (1000 -12)^2 = 1000000 - 24000 + 144 = 976144. So 0.988^2 is 0.976144. But our value is 0.9775, which is a bit higher. So 0.988^2=0.976144, which is less than 0.9775. Let's see, maybe 0.9885^2. Let me compute 0.9885^2.

(0.9885)^2 = (0.98 + 0.0085)^2. Or perhaps it's easier to compute 9885^2, but that's 97,73, something. Alternatively, using approximation. The difference between 0.9775 and 0.976144 is 0.001356. Let's see: derivative of x² is 2x. At x=0.988, derivative is ~1.976. So delta_x ≈ delta_y / (2x) = 0.001356 / (2 * 0.988) ≈ 0.001356 / 1.976 ≈ 0.000686. So x ≈ 0.988 + 0.000686 ≈ 0.988686. So β ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

But perhaps I can be more precise. Alternatively, maybe I can use exact expressions without approximating early on.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute β as sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Wait, because E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute β as (p c)/(E) → since p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ), so β = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ). Or, wait, let me write that correctly.

Wait, β = v/c = (pc²)/(E). Because p = gamma m v, and v = beta c.

Wait, let me think again. The relativistic momentum p is gamma m v. So p = gamma m v.

But in terms of energy, E = gamma m c². So E = gamma m c².

So, p = (gamma m v) = (E) (v) / c². So, v = (p c²) / E.

But also, from p² c^4 = E² - (m c^2)^2.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's compute beta as:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m
