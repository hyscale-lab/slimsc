--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, because the decay distance is how far the particle travels before it decays. So the formula is probably something like distance = velocity * lifetime. But wait, what's the exact approach here?

I think the mean proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is given by the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check the exact formula. Oh right, I think the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Because the decay distance is c multiplied by the lifetime, but wait no, because the particle is moving, so we have to consider its velocity. Oh wait, the lifetime is in the rest frame, so when the particle is moving, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. Oh right! So the proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the rest frame, and the observed lifetime is γ * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but wait. The decay distance is the product of the particle's speed and its lifetime in the lab frame. So the lab frame lifetime is γ τ. So the distance L = v * γ τ. Hmm. Let me get that straight.

Alternatively, since the particle is moving with some velocity, the lifetime we observe is longer due to time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime is τ' = γ τ. And the distance is v multiplied by this τ', so L = v * τ'.

But wait, the particle's speed v can be found from its energy and mass. Because the meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV. So its energy in the lab frame is E = γ m c². So I can find γ as E/(m c²). Let me compute that.

First, let's get all the units right. E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²) → but since E and m are both in GeV and GeV/c², the c² will cancel out. Wait, GeV is energy, and m c² would be GeV if m is in GeV/c². Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things, but let's proceed.

So γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ is approximately 6.6667.

Now, β is v/c. To find β, I can use the relation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So rearranging, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Calculating β: γ is 6.6667, so γ squared is about 44.4444. So 1/γ² is about 0.0225. Therefore, 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887, meaning v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me see: 8/1.2 is exactly 6.666... So 6.6667² is 44.4444. So 1/44.4444 is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So yeah, β is about 0.9887.

Alternatively, I could compute using exact values. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute β more precisely. Let's see:

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6667. So,

gamma = 20/3. So gamma squared is (400)/(9) ≈44.4444.

1 - (1/ gamma²) = 1 - 9/(400) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = let's see: 0.98868 approximately.

So beta is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So now I can compute the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ. Let's get the units right. ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because h-bar is 6.626e-34 J·s (Planck's constant), and 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J. So converting ħ into GeV·s: 6.626e-34 J·s * (1 GeV / 1.602e-10 J) ) = approximately 4.135e-25 GeV·s. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1.602e-10 J.

So ħ = 6.626e-34 J·s. So in GeV·s, ħ = (6.626e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) = approx 4.135e-25 GeV·s. Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I've heard that ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Yeah, that's the value I remember. So I can take ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is given as 320 MeV. Which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

But wait, I think I might have messed up. Let me compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.

So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

But wait, the lifetime is in the rest frame. The observed lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by tau, right? Because of time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime τ' = gamma * τ.

So τ' = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating that: 6 * 2.056875e-24 is 12.34125e-24, and 0.6666667 *2.056875e-24 is approx 1.37125e-24. So total is about 13.7125e-24 s? Wait, no, 2.056875e-24 multiplied by 6.666667 is:

2.056875e-24 * 6 = 12.34125e-24.

2.056875e-24 * 0.6666667 ≈ 1.37125e-24.

Adding together: 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125e-24 s → 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, wait. Hmm, 6.666667 * 2.056875e-24 is 13.7125e-24 s? Because 6 * 2 is 12, 0.6667 * 2 is 1.3334. So 13.3334e-24 s. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Calculating 6.666667 * 2.056875e-24:

6 * 2.056875e-24 = 12.34125e-24.

0.666667 *2.056875e-24 = (2/3)*2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-24.

Adding, 12.34125e-24 + 1.37125e-24 = 13.7125e-24 s.

So τ' ≈ 1.37125e-23 s. Wait, no, 13.7125e-24 is 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, 1e-24 *13.7125 is 1.37125e-23. Right.

Now, the velocity v is beta * c. Beta is 0.9887, c is approx 3e8 m/s.

v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So the mean decay distance L is v * tau'.

L ≈ (2.966e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s) = ?

Calculating that: 2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.966 * 1.37125) * 1e-15.

2.966 * 1.37125 ≈ let's compute:

2.966 * 1 = 2.966

2.966 * 0.3 = 0.8898

2.966 * 0.07 = 0.20762

2.966 * 0.00125 = 0.0037075

Adding: 2.966 + 0.8898 = 3.8558; plus 0.20762 = 4.06342; plus 0.0037075 ≈ 4.0671275.

So approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

Wait, 4.067 times 1e-15 is 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

Option C)5.0223 * 10^-15 m

So my calculation gives about 4.067e-15 m, which is close to option B.

Wait, but perhaps I made an approximation in gamma calculation. Let me check the exact gamma value again.

Wait, gamma = E/mc² = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.666666667.

Hmm, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 = 44.4444444.

1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Beta is sqrt(0.9775) = let's compute that more accurately. What's sqrt(0.9775)?

Well, 0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.008 = 0.01568.

0.008^2 = 0.000064.

Adding up: 0.9604 + 0.01568 = 0.97608; plus 0.000064 ≈ 0.976144. Our target is 0.9775, which is a bit higher. So what is (0.988 + some small delta)^2?

Let me compute 0.988^2 = 0.976144, as above.

We need 0.9775, which is 0.001356 higher than 0.976144.

So let's find delta such that (0.988 + delta)^2 = 0.9775.

Expanding: 0.988² + 2*0.988*delta + delta² = 0.9775.

0.976144 + 1.976 delta + delta² = 0.9775.

1.976 delta + delta² = 0.9775 - 0.976144 = 0.001356.

Assuming delta is small, delta squared is negligible. So 1.976 delta ≈ 0.001356 → delta ≈ 0.001356 /1.976 ≈ approx 0.000686.

So beta is approximately 0.988 + 0.000686 ≈ 0.988686.

So beta ≈ 0.988686, making v ≈ 0.988686 c.

Then v = 0.988686 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966058e8 m/s.

Now, tau' is gamma * tau.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

Given ħ =6.582e-25 GeV s, Gamma =0.32 GeV.

Tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Tau' = gamma * tau = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24.

20/3 is approximately 6.666666667.

Multiply 2.056875e-24 by 6.666666667: 

2.056875e-24 * 6 = 12.34125e-24.

2.056875e-24 * 0.666666667 = 1.37125e-24.

Adding gives 13.7125e-24 s, which is 1.37125e-23 s.

So tau' = 1.37125e-23 seconds.

So L = v * tau' = 2.966058e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Calculating that:

2.966058e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.966058 * 1.37125) * 1e-15.

Compute 2.966058 * 1.37125.

Let me compute that accurately:

Break it down:

2.966058 * 1.37125 = ?

Compute 2.966058 * 1 = 2.966058.

2.966058 * 0.3 = 0.8898174.

2.966058 * 0.07 = 0.20762406.

2.966058 * 0.00125 = 0.0037075725.

Adding all together:

2.966058 + 0.8898174 = 3.8558754.

Plus 0.20762406 → 4.0635 (approx 4.06349946).

Plus 0.0037075725 → approximately 4.06720703.

So 4.06720703e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to our calculated value.

Hmm, where might the small discrepancy come from? Perhaps more precise calculations of beta or gamma. Alternatively, perhaps the width is given in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, correct. Also, perhaps using a more precise value for ħ.

Wait, I used ħ =6.582e-25 GeV·s. Let me check that again. I think the exact value is approximately 6.582 ×10^(-25) GeV·s.

So our calculation should be correct, and the closest option is B) 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.0655e-16 m, which is smaller by a factor of 10. So perhaps I messed up an exponent somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of L.

Wait, tau' was 1.37125e-23 s.

v was 2.966e8 m/s.

So 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = ?

Multiply 2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23.

Which is (2.966 * 1.37125) * 1e8 * 1e-23 = (about 4.067) * 1e-15.

Yes, 1e8 * 1e-23 is 1e-15.

So L is about 4.067e-15 m.

So the correct answer is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but let me recompute the exact product of 2.966058e8 and 1.37125e-23.

Wait, 2.966058e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = ?

Breaking it down: 2.966058e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.966058 * 1.37125) * (1e8 * 1e-23) ) = (4.067207) * 1e-15 m.

Which is 4.067207e-15 m.

Looking at option B, it's 4.0655e-15, which is very close. So perhaps the precise calculation would yield that.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise calculation of beta and gamma leads to a slightly lower value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute without approximating beta as 0.9887. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression for the decay length.

Wait, another approach: The decay length L can be calculated using the formula:

L = c * τ * γ * β.

Because L = v * τ', and τ' = gamma * tau, and v = beta c.

So L = beta c gamma tau.

But tau is ħ / Gamma.

Putting it all together: L = (beta c gamma) (ħ / Gamma).

So let's compute this step by step.

Compute ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (9/400)) )= sqrt(391/400) )= sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.98868.

So beta = 0.98868.

So beta * gamma = 0.98868 * 6.6666667 ≈6.5912.

So then L = (beta * gamma) * c * (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: L = c * gamma * beta * (ħ / Gamma).

So L = c * gamma * beta * (ħ / Gamma).

So let's plug in the numbers.

c = 3e8 m/s.

gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

beta ≈0.98868.

ħ / Gamma = 2.056875e-24 s.

So putting it all together:

L = 3e8 m/s * 6.6666667 * 0.98868 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.6666667 * 0.98868 first.

6.6666667 * 0.98868 ≈6.6666667 *0.98868.

Let's compute that:

6 *0.98868 =5.93208.

0.66666667 *0.98868 ≈0.66666667 *0.98868 ≈ approx 0.66666667 *0.98868 = let's see:

0.66666667 *0.9 = 0.6, 0.66666667 *0.08868=approx 0.66666667 *0.08=0.05333333, and 0.66666667 *0.00868≈ 0.00577. So altogether 0.05333333 +0.00577=0.05910333. So total is 0.6 +0.05910333 ≈0.65910333.

So 6.6666667 * 0.98868 ≈5.93208 +0.65910333=6.5911833.

So back to L:

3e8 m/s * 6.5911833 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, no:

Wait, the formula is L = c * gamma * beta * (ħ / Gamma).

So that's 3e8 m/s * 6.5911833 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Hmm, wait, let's compute the product:

3e8 * 6.5911833 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute 3e8 * 6.5911833 = 1.977355e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.977355e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977355 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Calculate 1.977355 * 2.056875.

1.977355 * 2 =3.95471.

1.977355 *0.056875= let's compute that.

0.05 *1.977355 = 0.09886775.

0.006875 *1.977355 ≈ 0.0135606.

Adding: 0.09886775 +0.0135606=0.11242835.

So total is 3.95471 + 0.11242835 ≈4.06713835.

So L ≈4.06713835e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0671e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, and option C is 5.0223e-15.

So the closest is option B, but wait another thing: perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, the width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ =0.32 GeV.

And ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So when I compute ħ / Gamma =6.582e-25 /0.32 =
