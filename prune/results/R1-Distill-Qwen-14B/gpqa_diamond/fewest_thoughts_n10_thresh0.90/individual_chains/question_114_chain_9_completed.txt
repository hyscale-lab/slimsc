Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. There are two steps, each with their own reagents, and I need to choose from the given options. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So, it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile group, I'm thinking maybe it's some kind of nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the carbonyl group.

But wait, in the product, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile group. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of product structure. Alternatively, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2? Wait, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but butanenitrile would be four carbons in total. So, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the nitrile on the first carbon, and a hydroxyl group on the second, which is also methyl substituted. So structure would be: NC-CH(CH2OH)-CH2CH3? No, wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so the nitrile is on carbon 1. So the structure would be: NC-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's count the carbons. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. So, when it reacts with NaCN, perhaps it's adding the CN- to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but the product after the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the product has four carbons, with a nitrile group (CN) on the first carbon, a hydroxyl group (OH) on the second, which also has a methyl group attached. So structure is: NC-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, that would be four carbons. Let me count: the nitrile is on C1, then C2 is CH(OH)(CH3), then C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3? No, that can't be right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let me think about the reaction.

So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin formation typically uses a base, like NaCN and a weak acid or another base. Wait, but to form the cyanohydrin, the reaction is ketone plus CN- in a basic condition. Oh, but sometimes, the reaction can be done in acidic conditions as well. So, when a ketone reacts with CN- under acidic conditions, it might form the cyanohydrin. 

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, after the reaction, the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a C-OH and a C-CN. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If the cyanide adds, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that's only three carbons. Wait, no, perhaps it's four. Let me think: the starting ketone is (CH3)2CO, which is propan-2-one. Wait, no, but the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH2CH2)CO? Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)CH2CO? No, wait, butan-2-one is actually (CH3)COCH2CH3. Oh wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. No, butan-2-one is (CH3)CH2CO, but that's propanone. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3. No, wait, butan means four carbons. So, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. So, the structure is CH2CH2CO with the ketone on carbon 2. So, the structure is CH2CH2CO, but that's actually pentan-2-one? Wait, no. Let me think again: butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, that's four carbons in total. The structure would be: (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, that's three carbons. Wait, butan-2-one: the formula is C4H8O. The structure is CH2CH2CO, but I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2CH2)CO. Hmm, maybe I should proceed without getting too stuck on the structure.

Moving on, the initial reaction is a ketone reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically involves the addition of CN- to the carbonyl, which then gets protonated. The reaction can be done under acidic conditions. So, for the formation of the cyanohydrin, perhaps the reagent A is an acid, like H3O+.

So, in the first step, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in the presence of H3O+ (acid) to form the cyanohydrin. So, reagent A is H3O+. 

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So, A is either option A or B. Then, the second step is where the product from the first reaction is treated with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the second reaction is a bit more complex. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, this is a nitrile group attached to a structure that also has a hydroxyl group and a benzyl group. So, when this compound is treated with reagent B in water, it becomes a carboxylic acid. 

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. So, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions, possibly with heat. Alternatively, using a catalyst like HCl or another acid.

Wait, the reaction is: nitrile → carboxylic acid. So, the reagent B in water would be an acid. Alternatively, maybe it's HCl. So, in the second step, the nitrile is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to a carboxylic acid. 

So, the conditions for the second step would be HCl (as B). Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option C and D have B as HCl or something else. Wait, let me look back at the options:

Options:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So if I thought that in the first step, A is H3O+, then options A and B are possibilities. For the second step, if B is HCl, then option A or C would be possibilities, but since we already thought A is H3O+, then option A would be the one.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Maybe I should think about the structure. Alternatively, the second reaction is about the nitrile group being converted into a carboxylic acid. So, under acidic conditions, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. So, if reagent B is HCl, that would make sense because HCl is a strong acid.

So, in the second reaction, the reagent is HCl (as aqueous HCl), which would provide the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis. So, B would be HCl.

Putting it together, the first step uses H3O+ (A) and the second step uses HCl (B). Which matches option A.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, cyanohydrin formation can be done under basic conditions. For example, using a base like NaOH, but sometimes with a catalyst. So, maybe in the first reaction, the reagent is NaHSO3. Wait, but the product in the first step is a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, perhaps the first step uses H3O+ (acid) and the second step uses HCl.

Wait, another point: when you add HCN to a ketone under acidic conditions, you get the cyanohydrin. So, if the first step uses H3O+ as the reagent, that makes sense. Then, the second step uses HCl as the reagent for hydrolysis. So, the correct option would be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So, looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that's the correct choice.


The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, acidic conditions are typically required. Therefore, reagent A is identified as H₃O⁺, which provides the necessary acidic environment for the reaction.

The second reaction involves treating 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B in the presence of water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a nitrile hydrolysis reaction, where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Such hydrolysis reactions typically require strong acidic or basic conditions. Since the options provided include HCl as a reagent, it is logical to select HCl (B) as the reagent for this step, as it provides the acidic environment needed for the reaction.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B (CH₃COOH) is not strong enough to efficiently hydrolyze the nitrile group.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it does not provide the required acidic conditions for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both A and B are incorrect for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct choice is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
