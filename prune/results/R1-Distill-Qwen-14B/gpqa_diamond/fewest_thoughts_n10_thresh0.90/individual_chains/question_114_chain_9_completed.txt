Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, and the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B (and H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different A and B combinations.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me break this down. 

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN and reagent A, it forms a nitrile. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. Wait, but what's the role of NaCN here? Oh right, NaCN is a source of the cyanide ion (CN-), which is a nucleophile. So, the cyano group will add to the carbonyl carbon in a ketone, but wait, that would typically form a cyanohydrin. But wait, cyanohydrin formation usually requires an acid catalyst. Oh right! Because the carbonyl is a planar sp² hybridized carbon, adding CN- would be difficult without some activation. So, an acid catalyst like H3O+ (protonation) would help. 

Wait, but wait a second. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. So the product would have a CN group attached to the carbonyl carbon and a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon. So for (CH3)2CO, adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The formula for that would be CH2(C(OH)CH2CN)CH3? Or wait, perhaps I should count the carbons. Let me think: butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be CH2CH(CH3)CN with a hydroxyl on the same carbon as the CN? Or maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN as the nitrile is on the fourth carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2CN-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. No, maybe it's (CH3)2CH(OH)CH2CN. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, but the product is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Oh wait, perhaps butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so the product is a four-carbon chain with the nitrile group on one end. Alternatively, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. That would have four carbons: the C(OH) is the second carbon, then CH2CN as the third? Wait, no, the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN. So that's four carbons in total: the central carbon (from the ketone) plus the CH2CN. So that's butanenitrile with substituents. 

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add CN- to it, you get (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's three carbons in the main chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the nomenclature. Alternatively, maybe the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have four carbons. Let me count: the nitrile is on the first carbon, then the second carbon is the one with hydroxyl and methyl groups. So, the structure would be CH2CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2- ? No, maybe it's CH2CN-C(OH)(CH3)2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong, but perhaps the key point is the reaction mechanism.

But going back: the addition of CN- to a ketone would form a cyanohydrin. The reaction is typically done with an acid catalyst. So for the first reaction, A is probably H3O+ (proton source) which is option A or B. Alternatively, NaHSO3 could be involved, but I'm not sure. 

So, for the first reaction, the reagent A is probably H3O+ as the acid catalyst. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, options C and D have A as NaHSO3. So perhaps the correct options are A or B for the first part.

Now, the second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form the corresponding acid. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions. Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under various conditions. For example, under HCl (H2SO4, H2O) or under basic conditions. But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so probably done under acidic conditions. Alternatively, heating with HCl (like in a H2SO4/HCl mixture) would be typical. 

Wait, another thought: the hydrolysis can be done in two steps. First, under strong acid (like HCl) to form the amide, then further to the acid. Alternatively, using aqueous acid. Alternatively, maybe it's done under basic conditions, but that would give a sodium salt which then needs acid work-up. 

So, in the second reaction, reagent B is used along with H2O. So what is B? If the nitrile is in a molecule that has a hydroxyl group (as in the starting material), adding H2O and an acid would likely drive the hydrolysis. 

Wait, but another possibility is that the nitrile group is converted via hydrolysis to an acid. So, the nitrile (R-C≡N) becomes R-COOH. Common reagents for this are either strong acid (like HCl in H2SO4) with H2O, or maybe using a strong base like NaOH under heat, followed by acid work-up. But in the question, the reagent B is used along with H2O.

So, the options for B are HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D).

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. Would that be sufficient to hydrolyze the nitrile? I think that for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids, a strong acid is needed. So, HCl (HCl in H2O) or H2SO4 and H2O. Alternatively, in some cases, using a base like aqueous NaOH under reflux, then acidifying.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent B is given as a choice. Let me look at the options. The options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH. So which one would work? 

If B is HCl, then in H2O, we'd have an acidic aqueous solution. That's likely the condition for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid. So, for the second reaction, B would be HCl. So looking at the options, which options have B as HCl? Option A and C. 

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so options A and B for that), and the second reaction B is HCl (so options A and C).

Wait, so the first reaction uses A as H3O+, the second uses B as HCl. So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. That would fit. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Another possibility: could the second reagent B be something else? For example, sometimes nitrile hydrolysis is done under basic conditions. Let me think: when nitrile is treated with H2O and HCl, it undergoes hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions (like with NaOH), it forms the sodium salt of the acid, which is then acidified. 

In the second reaction, the product is the acid, so perhaps the conditions are acidic. So H2O with HCl would make sense for B. 

So, putting this together: for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (proton source) to catalyze the cyanohydrin formation. For the second reaction, reagent B is HCl, providing the acidic environment for the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → this matches what I thought.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → A here is NaHSO3 which is a source of HSO3-; I'm not sure if that's needed. 

Wait, but why would NaHSO3 be used in the first reaction? Oh, wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, another possibility: perhaps the first reaction involves some kind of addition that requires a different catalyst. 

Wait, what's the first reaction? It's the addition of CN- to the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. The typical condition for that is an acid catalyst, which is H+ like H3O+ or H2SO4. So, A should be H3O+.

Thus, the correct option is A, where A is H3O+, B is HCl.


The first reaction involves the addition of NaCN to butan-2-one, forming 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. To facilitate this reaction, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this purpose, as it provides the necessary H⁺ ions to catalyze the reaction. Therefore, reagent A is H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form the corresponding carboxylic acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) provides the acidic environment needed for this reaction. CH₃COOH, being a weak acid, is insufficient for this transformation. Thus, reagent B is HCl.

Combining these observations, the correct option is **A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
