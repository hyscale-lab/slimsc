Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think it through.

So the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Alright, first, relative speed. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds comparable to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, but wait—actually, I think the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) when you're finding the speed of one object from the frame of another. So in this case, the astronauts are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed should be the difference of their speeds, adjusted for relativity.

So let's plug in the numbers. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So v1 = 0.6c, v2 = 0.5c. The relative speed v_rel would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute the denominator first. 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, c² in numerator and denominator cancels, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That should eliminate options where relative speed is 0.1c (like option B) or 1.1c (which is impossible, since nothing can go faster than light, so option A is out).

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. So in relativity, the total energy of each astronaut is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, no. Wait, gamma is multiplied by the rest mass energy. So for the first astronaut, it's 2m * gamma1 * c²? Wait, no, the formula is E = gamma * m c². So for each, it's (gamma) multiplied by (mass) multiplied by c².

So for astronaut 1: mass is 2m, v=0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, v=0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². So roughly 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct option would be C.

Wait, let me double-check the relative speed calculation. (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c. Divide by (1 - (0.6*0.5)c² / c² ) → denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c → which is 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So yes, option C has the correct relative speed and energy.

Wait, but why is the relative speed an option in the problem? Because each astronaut is in their own frame, or are they considering the rest frame of one of them? Hmm, no, the problem asks for the relative speed of the two astronauts. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what is the speed of the second? Or vice versa. So which frame are we considering? Oh, right, in relativity, the relative speed depends on the frame. But the question doesn't specify whose frame; I think it's assuming that we calculate the speed of one relative to the other, which would require using the velocity addition formula. So the calculation I did earlier should be correct.

Another thought: in the problem, are the astronauts moving in the same direction or opposite? Oh, same direction, so their relative speed is the difference, and the calculation holds.

So the correct answer is option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed and the total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut:
- Mass: \(2m\), Velocity: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### Energy of the second astronaut:
- Mass: \(3m\), Velocity: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
