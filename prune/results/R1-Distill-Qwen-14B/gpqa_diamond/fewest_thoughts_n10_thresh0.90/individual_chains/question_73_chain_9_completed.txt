Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options are for the relative speed and the total energy.

First, I think about the relative speed. Wait, in classical mechanics, you just subtract the speeds, but relativity is different. Oh right, you can't just add or subtract velocities in relativity because of the speed limit c. I remember the formula for adding velocities relativistically. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds divided by that factor.

So let me plug in the values. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let me compute that. 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3. c squared in numerator, so that's 0.3c². Divide by c², so denominator becomes 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. So around 0.14c, which looks like option C or D.

Wait, but relative speed in relativity... am I doing it right? Because the formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Yes, I think that's correct. So 0.1c over 0.7 is about 0.142c, which is close to 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So between options C, D, and maybe B, which has 0.1c. So my calculation suggests the relative speed is 0.14c, so options C or D.

Next, the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, their masses are 2m and 3m, so I need to account for that.

Let me compute each individual energy.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is gamma1 * m_rest * c². Wait, wait. Wait, no, the astronaut's rest mass is 2m. So energy E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c².

Similarly, for the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c².

Calculating E1: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

E2: 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc². So the total energy is around 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. So from the calculations, it's 5.96, which matches option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed. The relative velocity formula. Oh wait, wait. The formula is correct, but I'm using the same direction. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²).

Wait, 0.6c * 0.5c = 0.3 c². Divided by c², that's 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. Numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.142857... c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### Energy of the first astronaut:
- Mass: \(2m\)
- Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### Energy of the second astronaut:
- Mass: \(3m\)
- Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

---

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
