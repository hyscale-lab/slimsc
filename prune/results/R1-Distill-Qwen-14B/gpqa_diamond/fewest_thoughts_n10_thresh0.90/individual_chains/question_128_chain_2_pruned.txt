Okay, so I've just started this job at a structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me four plasmids, and I need to pick the right one. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about choosing the correct DNA sequence that will produce the Human P53 protein. I remember that when cloning a gene into a plasmid for expression, several factors are important. The plasmid should have the correct reading frame, appropriate promoters, and the gene should be in frame with the ribosome binding sites.

Looking at the options, each is a DNA sequence, and I need to figure out which one correctly encodes the P53 protein. Let me break it down.

First, the P53 protein's amino acid sequence is provided. I need to look for that in the plasmids, but wait, the plasmids are DNA sequences, so I have to think in terms of the coding strand. The DNA sequence should match the mRNA that would translate to the given protein.

I remember that DNA is double-stranded, and the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T instead of U. So the plasmid's DNA should be the coding strand (same as mRNA) for the gene. So the DNA sequence in the plasmid should match the mRNA sequence, which is the same as the protein sequence except for T to U and adding the start codon.

Wait, the given protein starts with Met (M), which is the start codon, so the plasmid's sequence should start with ATG (the start codon) followed by the coding sequence.

Looking at the options, all of them start with ATGGAGGAGCC... So they all have the start codon. That's a good sign.

But wait, in cloning, sometimes the reading frame is important. The gene should be cloned into the plasmid in the correct frame so that the start codon is correctly positioned. So the plasmid should have a Kozak sequence or a ribosome binding site that's properly aligned.

Also, the plasmid must have the correct promoter and RBS (like the T7 promoter and RBS used in BL21 strains). But looking at the options, I think the main thing is to find the correct ORF.

Wait, another thing: E. coli uses the Shine-Dalgarno sequence for ribosome binding. The RBS is around the start codon. So the sequence before the start codon should have a good RBS.

Looking at the first part of each option, they all start similarly but may differ in some regions. Let me compare them.

Looking at the first part of option A: after ATG, there's GAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCCGGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCCGCATGCCAGAGGCTGCTCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGTCATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGCGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGCGCGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Hmm, looking for the correct sequence. Alternatively, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that correctly includes the entire gene without any stop codons or frame shifts.

Wait, maybe I should look for the presence of the correct reading frame. The presence of the correct start and stop codons, and the entire sequence in between. So I need to find the sequence that matches the coding strand of the P53 gene.

Another approach: the given P53 protein is provided, so perhaps the plasmid sequence should have the correct ORF, meaning the DNA sequence is the same as the mRNA (except T for U) and starts with ATG and ends with appropriate stop codon.

Looking at the options, I can compare the first few codons. The P53 protein starts with M (Met), which is ATG in DNA. So each option starts with ATG.

Wait, perhaps the issue is whether the plasmid has the correct reading frame. For E. coli, the plasmid's multiple cloning site (MCS) is usually designed with specific sites so that the gene is inserted in the correct frame.

Looking for the presence of a stop codon at the end. The options might have a termination codon after the correct sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmids have different things after the ATG. Let me look for the correct sequence beyond the start.

The given protein sequence is MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAMDDLMLSPDDIEQWFTEDPGPDEAPRMPEAAPPVAPAPAAPTPAAPAPAPSWPLSSSVPSQKTYQGSYGFRLGFLHSGTAKSVTCTYSPALNKMFCQLAKTCPVQLWVDSTPPPGTRVRAMAIYKQSQHMTEVVRRCPHHERCSDSDGLAPPQHLIRVEGNLRVEYLDDRNTFRHSVVVPYEPPEVGSDCTTIHYNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLEDSSGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDRRTEEENLRKKGEPHHELPPGSTKRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD.

I can try to translate the DNA sequences to see which one matches the given protein.

Wait, but that might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid should have the ATG followed by the correct codons for the P53 sequence.

Let me focus on the first few amino acids.

The first few codons of the P53 protein are Met, Glu, Glu, Pro, etc.

So the DNA would be ATG GAG GAG CCC GAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG ...

Looking at option A:

After ATG, the next part is GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCG CCT CTG AGC TCA GGA AAC ATT TTT CAG ACC TAT GGA AAA CT...

Wait, let's break that down. The coding strand is ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCG CCT CTG AGC TCA GGA AAC ATT TTT CAG ACC TAT GGA AAA CT...

Translating this:

ATG is Met.

GAG is E.

GAG is E.

CCG is Pro.

CAG is Gln.

TCA is Ser.

GAT is Asp.

CCT is Pro.

AGC is Ser.

GTC is Val.

GAG is Glu.

CCG is Pro.

CCT is Pro.

CTG is Leu.

AGC is Ser.

TCA is Ser.

GGA is Gly.

AAC is Asn.

ATT is Ile.

TTT is Phe.

CAG is Gln.

ACC is Thr.

TAT is Tyr.

GGA is Gly.

AAA is Lys.

CTA is Leu.

Wait, the first few amino acids in the P53 protein are MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQ...

So the first part: MEE PQ SD PSV EPL SQT FSD...

Wait, let's see. The first part of the plasmid DNA in option A gives the first amino acids as Met (M), Glu (E), Glu (E), Pro (P), Gln (Q), then Ser (S), Pro (P), etc. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the DNA sequence in option A starts with ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCG CCT CTG AGC TCA GGA AAC ATT TTT CAG ACC TAT GGA AAA CTA...

So the first six codons:

1. ATG → M

2. GAG → E

3. GAG → E

4. CCG → Pro

5. CAG → Gln

6. TCA → Ser

So the first six amino acids would be MEE PQS?

Wait, no. Because the fifth codon is CAG (Gln) which is Q, and the sixth is TCA (Ser, S). So the first six are MEEPQS.

Wait, looking at the P53 sequence, the first few are MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAMDDLMLSPDDIEQWFTEDPGPDEAPRMPEAAPPVAPAPAAPTPAAPAPAPSWPLSSSVPSQKTYQGSYGFRLGFLHSGTAKSVTCTYSPALNKMFCQLAKTCPVQLWVDSTPPPGTRVRAMAIYKQSQHMTEVVRRCPHHERCSDSDGLAPPQHLIRVEGNLRVEYLDDRNTFRHSVVVPYEPPEVGSDCTTIHYNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLEDSSGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDRRTEEENLRKKGEPHHELPPGSTKRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD.

The very start is M E E P Q S D P S V E P P L S Q E T F S D L K K L P E N N V L S P L P S Q A M D D L M L S P D D I E Q W F T E D P G P D E A P R M P E A A P P V A P A P A A P T P A A P A P A S W P L S S S V P S Q K T Y Q G S Y G F R L G F L H S G T A K S V T C T Y S P A L N K M F C Q L A K T C P V Q L W V D S T P P P G T R V R A M A I Y K Q S Q H M T E V V R R C P H H E R C S D S D G L A P P Q H L I R V E G N L R V E Y L D D R N T F R H S V V V P Y E P P E V G S D C T T I H Y N Y M C N S S S C M G G M N R R P I L T I I T L E D S S G N L L G R N S F E V R V C A C P G R D R R T E E E N L R K K G E P H H E L P P G S T K R A L P N N T S S S P P K K K P L D G E Y F T L Q I R G R E R F E M F R E L N E A L E L K D A Q A G K E P G G S R A H S S H L K S K K G Q S T S R H K K L M F K T E G P D S D.

So the first few amino acids are M E E P Q S D P S V E P P L S Q E T F S D L K K L P E N N V L S P L P S Q A M D D L M L S P D D I E Q W F T E D P G P D E A P R M P E A A P P V A P A P A A P T P A A P A P A S W P L ...

Comparing this to option A's translation:

The first few codons would be ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCG CCT CTG AGC TCA GGA AAC ATT TTT CAG ACC TAT GGA AAA CTA ...

So the amino acids are:

1. M

2. E

3. E

4. Pro

Wait, wait. Let's list each codon and its amino acid:

1. ATG → M

2. GAG → E

3. GAG → E

4. CCG → Pro

5. CAG → Gln (Q)

6. TCA → Ser (S)

7. GAT → Asp (D)

8. CCT → Pro (P)

9. AGC → Ser (S)

10. GTC → Val (V)

11. GAG → Glu (E)

12. CCG → Pro (P)

13. CCT → Pro (P)

14. CTG → Leu (L)

15. AGC → Ser (S)

16. TCA → Ser (S)

17. GGA → Gly (G)

18. AAC → Asn (N)

19. ATT → Ile (I)

20. TTT → Phe (F)

21. CAG → Gln (Q)

22. ACC → Thr (T)

23. TAT → Tyr (Y)

24. GGA → Gly (G)

25. AAA → Lys (K)

26. CTA → Leu (L)

Wait, so the first few amino acids would be M, E, E, Pro, Gln, Ser, Asp, Pro, Ser, Val, Glu, Pro, Pro, Leu, Ser, Ser, Gly, Asn, Ile, Phe, Gln, Thr, Tyr, Gly, Lys, Leu...

Hmm, that's different from the given P53 sequence. The correct sequence should start with MEE PQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAMDD...

But according to option A's translation, the first few are MEEPQSSD...

Wait, the fourth codon is Pro, fifth is Q, sixth S, then D, then P, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a plasmid that correctly includes all the amino acids in the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid has an incorrect stop codon inserted somewhere, causing the protein to be truncated. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options, options C and D are shorter. Let me check their sequences.

Option C: The sequence is shorter. It starts with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA...

Wait, after the start codon, the first few bases are GAG GAG CC CTC... Hmm, different from option A. Let me see what that translates to.

The first few codons would be:

ATG → M

GAG → E

GAG → E

CCC → Pro

CTC → Leu

GAG → Glu

TCA → Ser

GAT → Asp

CCT → Pro

AGC → Ser

GTC → Val

GAG → Glu

CCT → Pro

CTG → Leu

AGC → Ser

TCA → Ser

GGA → Gly

AAC → Asn

ATT → Ile

TTT → Phe

CAG → Gln

ACC → Thr

TAT → Tyr

GGA → Gly

AAA → Lys

CTA → Leu

So the amino acids start as M, E, E, Pro, Leu, Glu, Ser, Asp, Pro, Ser, Val, Glu, Pro, Leu, Ser, Ser, Gly, Asn, Ile, Phe, Gln, Thr, Tyr, Gly, Lys, Leu...

Comparing to the correct P53, which starts M, E, E, Pro, Gln, Ser, Asp, Pro, Ser, Val, E, P, etc.

So option C's first few are MEEP Leu... Hmm, but correct P53 starts with MEE PQS.

Wait, the fifth codon in option C is CTC (Leu), but in correct P53 it's CAG (Gln). So that's different.

So option C's sequence might be incorrect because the fifth codon is Leu instead of Gln.

Looking at option B:

Option B starts similarly to option A but let me check.

Option B's DNA starts with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGC C C C TC...

Wait, no, let me look carefully. Option B's initial sequence is:

ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCCGGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATGCCAGAGGCTGCTCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGTCATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGTC CGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCCCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, looking at the initial part of option B: It starts with ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCG C... Option B seems to have the same initial sequence as option A but perhaps has a different later part.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of any premature stop codons.

Wait, another approach: The correct plasmid should have the correct ORF for the entire P53 protein. So I can compare the sequences for any differences.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is the one that includes the correct nucleotides for the entire amino acid sequence. Let me think: the DNA is the coding strand, so each codon corresponds directly to the amino acid.

Let me take a small portion of the given protein and find the correct DNA sequence.

For example, the first few amino acids are M E E P Q S D P S V E P P L S Q E T F S D L K K L P E N N V L S P L P S Q A M D D L M L S P D D I E Q W F T E D P G P D E A P R M P E A A P P V A P A P A A P T P A A P A P A S W P L ...

Let's find which option's DNA sequence corresponds to this.

Let's take the first few codons: M (ATG), E (GAG), E (GAG), P (CCG), Q (CAG), S (TCA), D (GAT), P (CCT), S (AGC), V (GTC), E (GAG), P (CCG), P (CCG), L (CTG), S (AGC), Q (CAG), E (GAG), T (GCT), F (TGG), S (TCA), D (GAT), L (CTA), K (AAG), K (AAG), L (CTT), P (CGG), E (GAG), N (AAC), N (AAT), V (GTT), L (CTC), S (TCA), P (TGG), L (CTG), P (TGG), S (TCA), Q (CAG), A (GCT), M (ATG), D (GAT), D (GAT), L (CTT), M (ATG), L (CTT), S (TCA), P (TCA), D (GAT), D (GAT), I (ATC), E (GAG), Q (CAG), W (TGG), F (TGG), T (TCA), E (GAG), D (GAT), P (CTC), G (GCT), P (CTC), D (GAT), E (GAG), A (GCT), P (TCA), R (CGA), M (ATG), P (CTG), E (GAG), E (GAG), A (GCT), A (GCT), P (CTT), P (CTT), V (GTT), A (GCT), P (CTC), A (GCT), P (CTC), A (GCT), A (GCT), P (CTT), T (TCA), P (TGG), A (GCT), A (GCT), P (CTC), A (GCT), P (CTC), A (GCT), S (TCA), W (TGG), P (TGG), L (CTG), etc.

Wait, perhaps comparing the DNA sequences.

Let me take the first 50 nucleotides of each option and see which one matches.

The protein sequence starts with M E E P Q S D P S V E P P L S Q E T F S D L K K L P E N N V L S P L P S Q A M D D L M L S P D D I E Q W F T E D P G P D E A P R M P E A A P P V A P A P A A P T P A A P A P A S W P L S S S V P S Q K T Y Q G S Y G F R L G F L H S G T A K S V T C T Y S P A L N K M F C Q L A K T C P V Q L W V D S T P P P G T R V R A M A I Y K Q S Q H M T E V V R R C P H H E R C S D S D G L A P P Q H L I R V E G N L R V E Y L D D R N T F R H S V V V P Y E P P E V G S D C T T I H Y N Y M C N S S S C M G G M N R R P I L T I I T L E D S S G N L L G R N S F E V R V C A C P G R D R R T E E E N L R K K G E P H H E L P P G S T K R A L P N N T S S S P P K K K P L D G E Y F T L Q I R G R E R F E M F R E L N E A L E L K D A Q A G K E P G G S R A H S S H L K S K K G Q S T S R H K K L M F K T E G P D S D.

Wait, perhaps the correct plasmid would have the DNA sequence that matches this entire amino acid sequence. So I should look for the plasmid where the DNA sequence translates to the given protein.

Looking at option A, the first part after ATG is GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCG CCT CTG AGC TCA GGA AAC ATT TTT CAG ACC TAT GGA AAA CTA TTA TT... Hmm. Let me translate the first 30 nucleotides of option A.

Option A's first 30 nucleotides (after ATG): GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCG CCT CTG.

So the amino acids would be:

GAG → E

GAG → E

CCG → Pro

CAG → Q

TCA → S

GAT → D

CCT → P

AGC → S

GTC → V

GAG → E

CCG → Pro

CCT → Pro

CTG → L

So the first 13 amino acids: E, E, Pro, Q, S, D, P, S, V, E, Pro, Pro, L.

Wait, the correct sequence starts with M E E P Q S D P S V E P P L S Q E T F S D L K K L...

Hmm, the first 13 from option A are EEPQSDPSPV E Pro Pro L.

Wait,
