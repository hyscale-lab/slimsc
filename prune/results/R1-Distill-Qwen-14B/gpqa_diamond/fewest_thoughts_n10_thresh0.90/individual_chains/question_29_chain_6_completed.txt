--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the changes in the target gene. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

So the intact gene sequence is given, and there are four mutants. I suppose each mutation changes certain parts of the DNA. I need to figure out which mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function, thereby stopping the production of the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, the key here is probably to look for a mutation that disrupts the coding sequence in a way that the resulting protein is nonfunctional. This could be a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the reading frame, leading to a truncated or completely different protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact, the third and fourth nucleotides change from TTT to TCT. Let me write it out:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACA GCT...
So, the third codon in the gene would change. Let's see the amino acids. The original is TTT, which is phenylalanine. Mutant 1's next codon is TCT (serine), and then ACA (threonine). Maybe this is a missense mutation, altering the amino acids. But would that completely eliminate the compound? Maybe not, unless it's in a critical region.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the changes. The intact is TTTCTCGCT. Mutant 2's sequence is TCTAAGCT. Let me see:

Original: TTT CTC GCT
Mutant 2: TCT AAG CTT ?

Wait, the exact change is somewhere in the first exon area. Looking at the first part:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant 2: ...TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the first three nucleotides after ATG are TTT in intact, but in mutant 2, they're TCT. Then after that, the next few nucleotides are different. Wait, perhaps a deletion or insertion?

Alternatively, maybe a base change leading to a stop codon. Let me look for a stop codon (TGA, TAG, or TAA).

Wait, the original ends with TGA. All the sequences end with TGA, which is a stop codon. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, looking at Mutant 3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact gene, the intact has TCTGTGGAT... but Mutant3 has TGTCACT.

Wait, let me see. The intact gene at that point is TACTTCTGTGGAT, which would be the 5th or 6th codon onwards. Mutant3 has TGTCACT instead.

Wait, the intact is ...TACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: ...TGTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps a change in the sequence. Let me see the exact difference. Maybe a point mutation in a critical area.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene:

Intact has GCT GGT ACT, while Mutant4 has ACT CTT.

Wait, perhaps in the middle of the exon, so maybe it's causing a frameshift? Because, exons are coding, so any change in the reading frame could lead to a completely different amino acid sequence downstream.

Wait, but wait. How many nucleotides changed in each mutant?

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: The first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT... becomes ATG TCT ACA GCT...

So, that's a change from TTT to TCT (Phe to Ser) and then CTC becomes ACA (Leu to Thr). So, two codon changes, but they're in the same frame, so the reading frame isn't shifted. Probably a missense mutation.

Mutant2: Let's see. The sequence goes from TTT CTC GCT to TCT AAG CTT.

So, TTT (Phe) becomes TCT (Ser), then CTC (Leu) becomes AAG (Lys), and GCT (Ala) becomes CTT (Leu). So another missense, same frame. No frameshift, so probably not a premature stop.

Mutant3: Let's see... The original is TACTTCTGTGGAT... and mutant3 is TGTC ACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps a different way: original has TACTTCTGTGGAT, while mutant3 has TGTCACTTCTGTGGAT.

Wait, maybe a substitution in the middle. Let's break it into codons.

Original: TAC TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant3: TGT CAC TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so the first codon is TAC (Tyr) in original, mutant3 is TGT (Cys). Then C in original is TCT (Ser), but mutant3 has CAC (His). So two more changes. But again, same frame.

Mutant4: The sequence changes from GCT GGT ACT to ACT CTT.

Wait, looking at the exact part: intact has GCTG G TACT, and mutant4 has ACT CTT.

Wait, maybe the sequence is:

Intact: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant4: ...ACT CTT CTG TGG AT...

Wait, perhaps it's a deletion or insertion. Let me count the number of nucleotides.

Original: GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT
Mutant4: ACT CTT CTG TGG AT

Wait, perhaps in the original, after GCT GGT ACT, then TCT GTG GAT. So that's a run of exons. If in mutant4, it's ACT CTT CTG TGG AT, that's a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the change is that a segment is inserted or deleted. Let me think. If the exons are spliced correctly, any mutation in the coding sequence could cause issues.

Wait, another approach: looking for a frameshift or a stop codon.

Looking at the sequences:

Mutant1: The first change is TTT to TCT (no stop codon introduced).

Mutant2: No stop codon, just changes in amino acids.

Mutant3: Let's see, the first codon is TAC (Tyr) in the intact, but in mutant3 it's TGT (Cys). The next codon in the intact is TCT (Ser), but in mutant3 it's CAC (His). No stop codon introduced.

Mutant4: Looking at the sequence, after the change, I think it may have a different reading frame.

Wait, the intact gene has GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4 has ACT CTT CTG TGG AT...

Wait, let's compare the nucleotides:

Intact: ... GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...
Mutant4: ... ACT CTT CTG TGG AT ...

Wait, perhaps a deletion occurred. Let me see the exact letters.

The intact part is: GCTG G TACT TCTGTGGAT.

Mutant4's part is: ACTCTTCTG TGGAT ...

Wait, maybe the original is GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT.

Mutant4: ACT CTT CTG TGG AT.

Wait, perhaps the original is GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT.

Mutant4 has ACT CTT CTG TGG AT.

Wait, so if I count the letters:

Original exon segment: GCTG G TAC T TCT GTG GAT.

Mutant4: ACT CTT CTG TGG AT.

Hmm, perhaps the number of nucleotides changed. Let me see.

Original: G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Mutant4: A C T C T T C T G T G G A T...

Wait, perhaps a three-nucleotide deletion? For example, if three nucleotides are missing, that would cause a frameshift. Let me check.

In the intact gene, let's say the sequence is:

... GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Which is 15 nucleotides: GCT (3), GGT (3), ACT (3), TCT (3), GTG (3), GAT (3) – wait, but maybe it's a longer stretch. Alternatively, perhaps in the mutant4, the sequence is shorter.

Wait, maybe the intact has GCT GGT ACT, and mutant4 has ACT CTT. Let's see:

If the original is GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT..., and mutant4 is ACT CTT CTG TGG AT...

So, perhaps the mutant4 has a deletion of three nucleotides. For example, the original is GCTG G TAC T TCT GTG GAT..., and mutant4 is ACT CTT CTG TGG AT...

Wait, perhaps the exact change is in the middle. Let me compare the sequences:

Intact: ...GCTG G TAC T TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant4: ...ACT CTT CTG TGG AT...

Wait, perhaps the original is GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT, and mutant4 is ACTCTTCTGTGGAT. So, the first part of the original is GCTGGTACT.

Mutant4 has ACTCTTCTGT.

Wait, that's a different arrangement. Let me count the letters.

Original: G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T ... (24 letters)
Mutant4: A C T C T T C T G T G G A T ... (18 letters)

Wait, that's a 6-letter difference. So, perhaps there's a 6-bp change. If it's a deletion of 3 nucleotides, that would cause a frameshift, altering the reading frame from that point onward.

Wait, but 6 nucleotides would be a two-codon deletion. If the original had a segment of 6 nucleotides, and mutant4 is missing those 6, the reading frame would shift by two codons. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in mutant4 is a three-nucleotide addition or deletion, causing a frameshift. Let me check the exact positions.

Looking at the first part of the mutant sequences:

Mutant4's sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

The intact has 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, the difference is in the region after ATGTTT. Intact: CTCGCTGGTACT.

Mutant4: ACTCTTCTGT.

Wait, wait, perhaps in the intact, the sequence is CTCGCTGGTACT, and in mutant4, it's ACTCTTCTGT.

Wait, so the original sequence is CTC GCT GGT ACT, and mutant4 is ACT CTT CTG T.

Hmm. Let me compare each position:

Original: C T C G C T G G T A C T...

Mutant4: A C T C T T C T G T...

Wait, perhaps a substitution of six nucleotides. Let me write it out.

Original: CTC GCT GGT ACT → positions 4-15 (maybe)
Mutant4: ACT CTT CTG T → positions 4-11?

Wait, perhaps the original has CTCGCTGGTACT, which is 11 nucleotides. Mutant4 has ACTCTTCTGT, which is 10 nucleotides. So, a deletion of one nucleotide? That would throw off the frame.

Wait, but 10 vs 11 nucleotides. That would change the reading frame for the rest of the gene. So, that would be a frameshift mutation, causing a completely different amino acid sequence from that point onwards, potentially leading to a premature stop codon.

If a frameshift occurs, the downstream codons are all changed, which could lead to a nonfunctional protein. So, that might be the mutation that inactivates the gene.

Alternatively, looking for a stop codon. Let me check if any of the mutants introduce a stop codon earlier.

Mutant1: Changes from TTT (Phe) to TCT (Ser), then CTC (Leu) to ACA (Thr). So, the codons are still in frame. No stop codon introduced.

Mutant2: Changes TTT to TCT, CTC to AAG, GCT to CTT. So, codons are still read in triplets. No stop codon.

Mutant3: Changes TAC (Tyr) to TGT (Cys), TCT (Ser) to CAC (His). So, the first two codons change, but same frame. No stop.

Mutant4: If the reading frame shifts, perhaps a stop codon appears. Let's see. The original after the mutation would have a frameshift, so the codons would be read differently. So, perhaps in the middle, a stop codon is introduced.

Alternatively, maybe a nonsense mutation (early stop codon) would be more efficient in knocking out the gene.

But looking at the sequences, none of the mutants except perhaps Mutant4 have a frameshift.

Wait, but does Mutant4 have a frameshift?

Looking at the sequences again. The intact gene is:

...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4 is:

...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps in the intact, it's TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, maybe that's not a frameshift. Let me count the number of nucleotides in each.

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT

That's 5 codons (15 nucleotides). Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT.

Wait, that's also 5 codons (15 nucleotides). So no frameshift; same number of nucleotides. So, perhaps it's a substitution within the same codons.

Wait, so perhaps the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT.

Mutant4 is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT.

So, the second codon (CTC → TAC), third codon (GCT → GCT remains?), wait no, let me write it more carefully.

Wait, the intact is: positions 4-18: T T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Mutant4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Wait, perhaps the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT.

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT.

So, in the second codon, CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr). Third codon, GCT (Ala) becomes GCT (Ala) again? Wait, perhaps in the third codon, it's GCT → GCT? No, perhaps not. Wait, the third codon is GCT in the original, and mutant4 has GCT as well. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the exact change is in the first exon, but I'm not seeing any stop codon introduced by the mutations.

Alternatively, another approach: which mutation would cause a premature stop codon?

Looking at the entire sequence, all mutants end with TGA, which is a stop codon. So, the original gene ends with TGA, and all mutants end with TGA as well. So, that's the same.

So perhaps the key is not in the stop codon, but in the coding sequence.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the gene has a segment where a stop codon is introduced earlier.

Wait, let's see. Let me write out the codons for each mutant.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... TGA

So that's methionine, phenylalanine, leucine, alanine, glycine, threonine, serine, valine, glutamic acid, etc., until stop.

Mutant4's sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... TGA.

So the codons would be:

ATG (M), TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A), ACT (T), TCT (S), GTG (V), GAT (D), ... TGA.

So, the third codon is TAC (tyrosine instead of leucine in the original), fourth codon is GCT (alanine), fifth is ACT (threonine), which in the original was ACT (threonine). Wait, same as original? Or perhaps I'm misaligning.

Wait, maybe the original sequence is:

1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTC
4: GCT
5: GGT
6: ACT
7: TCT
8: GTG
9: GAT
...

Mutant4:

1: ATG
2: TTT
3: TAC
4: GCT
5: ACT
6: TCT
7: GTG
8: GAT
...

So, the third codon in the original was CTC (leucine), now in mutant4 it's TAC (tyrosine). Then the fourth codon was GCT (alanine) → GCT (same). The fifth codon in original was GGT (glycine), now it's ACT (threonine). Hmm, so changes in codons 3 and 5.

But in this case, these are missense mutations, not leading to a stop codon. So the protein would still be made, but with different amino acids.

Wait, maybe another approach: which mutation introduces a stop codon earlier, leading to a truncated protein.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence, I don't see a stop codon introduced earlier. Because the stop is still at the end.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the key is in the position of the mutation.

The question says that the mutations are in the first exon. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here would affect the protein.

If a mutation creates a stop codon early in the sequence, the gene product would be truncated, possibly leading to a nonfunctional protein. So, which mutant introduces a stop codon?

Looking for a change from a codon to a stop codon (TGA, TAG, TAA) in any of the mutants.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence again, any codon becoming a stop? Let's think about each codon.

Mutant4's codons are:

1: ATG (M)
2: TTT (F)
3: TAC (Y)
4: GCT (A)
5: ACT (T)
6: TCT (S)
7: GTG (V)
8: GAT (D)
...

No stop codons until the end. So same as the original.

Wait, perhaps the frameshift I was thinking earlier wasn't a frameshift. If the number of nucleotides didn't change, perhaps it's a substitution that changes the amino acids but doesn't disrupt the protein's function. So, which of these mutations would most likely disrupt the gene's function?

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon in the middle.

Let me check again.

Looking for any of the mutations that cause a stop codon in the middle.

Mutant1: The changes are TTT → TCT (Ser) and CTC → ACA (Thr). No stop codon.

Mutant2: Changes to TCT, AAG, CTT. No stop.

Mutant3: Changes to TGT (Cys), CAC (His). No stop.

Mutant4: No stop before the end.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the mutation disrupts a critical functional domain of the protein. For example, a substitution in an active site.

But without knowing the structure of the protein, it's hard to say. But the question is about which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, so likely the gene product is nonfunctional.

Wait, perhaps a missense mutation that changes a critical amino acid could disable the enzyme. Alternatively, a frameshift leading to a nonfunctional protein would be more likely.

But earlier I thought Mutant4's sequence didn't cause a frameshift because the number of nucleotides remained the same.

Wait, let me go back. Let me count the number of nucleotides in each mutant's target region.

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... Let's count the nucleotides from the start of the sequence.

Assuming the intact sequence:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So each codon is three letters. So, 3n letters.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Same number of letters, so same number of codons. So no frameshift.

So, the only way is a missense mutation that disrupts the function, or perhaps a nonsense mutation (stop codon) introduced.

But I don't see a stop codon introduced in any of the mutants except the original's end.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, disrupting splicing. But the question says the mutations are in the exons, so splicing wouldn't be directly affected.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is in the first exon, leading to a truncated protein if it introduces a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence changes from GCTG GT ACT to ACT CTT CTG. Let me write the original and mutant4's sequences in the same alignment.

Original: GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT
Mutant4: ACT CTT CTG TGG AT

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me write them out as nucleotides.

Original: GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT → G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T → 15 nucleotides.

Mutant4: ACT CTT CTG TGG AT → A C T C T T C T G T G G A T → 12 nucleotides.

Ah! So the mutant4 has 12 nucleotides, whereas the original has 15. That's a 3-nucleotide deletion. So, that's a frameshift of one codon. So, after the mutation, the reading frame shifts by one, leading to a completely different sequence from that point onward. This could lead to a premature stop codon.

Wait, but in the original, it's 15 nucleotides, and mutant4 is 12. So, the number is not the same. So, perhaps a 3-nucleotide deletion. Let me confirm.

Original fragment: GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT → 5 codons (15 nucleotides).

Mutant4 fragment: ACT CTT CTG TGG AT → 4 codons (12 nucleotides), but wait, 12 nucleotides would normally be 4 codons. But the original had 5 codons.

Wait, perhaps the original is longer. Wait, the original gene (as given) is longer than the mutant4's? Let me check the full sequences.

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, so in the beginning, the original is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4 is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the number of nucleotides is the same, I think. Because ATG is 3, TTT is 3, etc. So, same number of codons. So, no frameshift. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier about the frameshift.

Wait, but when I compared the sequences, the middle part had a different number of nucleotides. Perhaps I made a mistake there.

So, perhaps none of the mutations introduces a stop codon. Then, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts a critical region of the gene, like the start codon or a critical domain.

Wait, all the mutants have ATG as the start codon, so that's fine.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation occurs downstream in one of the mutants. Let me check.

Looking at the sequences, all end with TGA, so that's the same. So perhaps they all have the same stop codon.

Wait, another thought: perhaps a mutation that alters the promoter region. But the question says the mutations are in the target gene's exons, so probably in the coding region.

Hmm. Another approach: which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's product. For that, a nonsense mutation is best, as it stops translation early.

So, the only way this can happen is if one of the codons becomes a stop codon. Let me check each mutant.

Mutant1: Changes TTT to TCT (Ser), CTC to ACA (Thr). No stop.

Mutant2: TTT → TCT, CTC → AAG (Lys), GCT → CTT (Leu). No stop.

Mutant3: TAC (Tyr) → TGT (Cys), TCT → CAC (His). No stop.

Mutant4: TCT → ACT (Thr), GCT → CTT (Leu). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the third codon is TAC, which is Tyr. Then the fourth codon is GCT (Ala). The fifth codon is ACT (Thr). So no stop.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe the key is in the position of the mutation. The question says the mutations are at the beginning of the first exon. So, perhaps a mutation that disrupts the start codon or something near the beginning.

Looking at the sequences, all the mutants have ATG as the start, so that's unchanged.

Wait, another possibility: the mutation creates a new methionine start site upstream, leading to a different reading frame. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a stop codon a few codons into the sequence.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), but in the original, it was CTC (Leu). So that's just an amino acid change.

Hmm. I'm not seeing a clear stop codon introduced.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to look for which mutation would most likely result in a nonfunctional protein. That could be either a frameshift leading to a completely different amino acid sequence or a nonsense mutation introducing a stop codon.

But none of the mutations except the original have a stop codon in the same place. So, perhaps the only way is to look for a frameshift. Earlier I thought Mutant4 had a deletion, but perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, looking again: the original is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant4 is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Comparing the sequences:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the third codon in the original is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr). Then the fourth codon in original is GCT (Ala), in Mutant4 it's GCT (Ala). Wait, so same. The fifth codon in original is GGT (Gly), in Mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So, two codon changes: third and fifth.

So, no frameshift. So, the reading frame is the same. So, the protein would have different amino acids at positions 3 and 5.

So, which of these would most likely disrupt the protein? Well, if the changes are in critical regions, but without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to look for a nonsense mutation (stop codon) introduced earlier, which would truncate the protein.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence again, perhaps the fifth codon is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). No stop codon.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2. Let me look at Mutant2.

Mutant2's sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So, comparing to the original:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant2: ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, the second codon is TTT→TCT (Ser), third codon is CTC→AAG (Lys), fourth codon is GCT→CTT (Leu). So, three changes.

No stop codon, but changes in amino acids.

Wait, perhaps the third codon in the original (CTC, Leu) becomes AAG (Lys) in Mutant2. That's a significant change, but how does that affect the protein? Without knowing, hard to say.

Wait, perhaps another thought: the question says the mutant that 'lets you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound'. So, the gene product is the enzyme that produces the compound. Disrupting the gene would stop the compound's synthesis.

So, a frameshift or a nonsense mutation would likely be more effective in knocking out the gene than a missense mutation, which might just alter the protein but not stop it entirely.

But earlier I thought that Mutant4's sequence didn't cause a frameshift. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon. Only in that case, the gene product would be truncated, and the anti-nutritional compound wouldn't be made.

Looking through all the mutants, the only way a stop codon is introduced is if a codon becomes TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking at each mutation:

None of the codons in any mutant except the last one (TGA) are stop codons. So, none of the mutants introduce a new stop codon.

Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: perhaps the mutation leads to a nonfunctional enzyme, such as by creating a premature stop codon in a critical region.

Wait, but without a stop codon, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations cause a large enough change in the protein structure that the function is disrupted. But which mutation would that be?

Given all this, perhaps the best option is to choose the mutant that has the most drastic change. Looking at the options:

Mutant1 has two codon changes.

Mutant2 has three codon changes.

Mutant3 has two codon changes.

Mutant4 has two codon changes.

Hmm. So, Mutant2 has the most changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation creates a new splice donor or acceptor site, but since the mutations are in the exons, splicing shouldn't be affected.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the gene has five exons and four introns. Maybe the mutation is in a region that, when spliced, leads to a frameshift in the mRNA.

But the question states that the mutations are in the first exon. So, any splicing would affect the intron-exon boundaries, but the first exon is the one being mutated. So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps a deletion in the first exon removes a part of the coding region, leading to a shorter protein. But without knowing where the mutation is, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the number of nucleotides changed. Let me count the differences between each mutant and the original.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant2: ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me write each mutation's sequence:

Original: positions 4-18: T T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T … T G A

Mutant1: T C T A C A G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C … T G A

Wait, perhaps the mutation changes a few nucleotides. Let me count the differences.

Original: T T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Mutant1: T C T A C A G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

So, in the first few nucleotides, the original is T T C G C T, and Mutant1 is T C T A C A G C T. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count the number of nucleotide differences in the given sequences.

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

The difference is in the third codon: TTT → TCT (Ser), and CTC → ACA (Thr).

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Differences: TTT → TCT (Ser), CTC → AAG (Lys), GCT → CTT (Leu).

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Differences: TCT → TAC (Cys), TCT → CAC (His).

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Differences: GCT → ACT (Thr), ACT → TCT (Ser).

Wait, but the exact differences might not be obvious. But all have changes in the first few codons.

I think I've gone in circles. Let me try to think differently.

The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That implies the gene product (the enzyme) is not functional.

Therefore, the mutation should disrupt the gene's function. The best way is to create a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.

Looking again, perhaps Mutant4's sequence has a stop codon. Let me check.

Mutant4: ...ACT CTT CTG TGG AT...

Wait, CTG is a codon for Leu, TGG is Trp, and AT is part of the next codon.

Wait, perhaps the last codon before TGA is different.

Original ends with ...GTCGT…TGA.

Mutant4 ends with ...GTCGT…TGA.

So, same stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the key is that Mutant4's sequence is shorter. Let me count the number of nucleotides in the given sequences.

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ → let's count the letters up to TGA.

It's 3 (ATG) + 3 (TTT) + 3 (CTC) + 3 (GCT) + 3 (GGT) + 3 (ACT) + 3 (TCT) + 3 (GTG) + 3 (GAT) + ... = 27 letters before TGA.

Mutant4's sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ → same length?

ATG (3) + TTT (3) + TAC (3) + GCT (3) + ACT (3) + TCT (3) + GTG (3) + GAT (3) + ... → same 27 letters. So same number of codons. So, no frameshift.

So, none of the mutants have a frameshift. So, all changes are in the same reading frame.

In that case, the only way to disrupt the gene is a nonsense mutation, which would be a stop codon introduced earlier.

But I don't see any. All stop at the same point.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts a critical region of the gene. For example, the active site of the enzyme.

If the mutations are in the first exon, perhaps the changes are in the beginning of the protein. So, a mutation that changes a critical amino acid early on might disrupt the entire structure.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say. So, perhaps the best approach is to choose the mutant with the most changes leading to a frameshift or a stop codon.

Wait, but I don't see any.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation creates a new in-frame stop codon. Let me check each codon.

Mutant1: The third codon is TCT (Ser), fourth is ACA (Thr). No stop.

Mutant2: Third codon is TCT (Ser), fourth is AAG (Lys). No stop.

Mutant3: Third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth is CAC (His). No stop.

Mutant4: Third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala). No stop.

So, no new stop codons introduced.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options given. The options are A) Mutant2, B) Mutant3, C) Mutant1, D) Mutant4.

From the initial analysis, Mutant4's sequence appears to have a deletion, but upon counting, it doesn't. So, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger change in the sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the best bet is to choose the mutant that introduces the most drastic change, which is probably Mutant4, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: exons are joined together, so perhaps a mutation that disrupts the reading frame would cause a frameshift leading to a nonfunctional protein. But earlier, I thought Mutant4 didn't cause a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the changes are such that a stop codon is introduced. Let me look at the codons again.

Mutant4's codons:

1: ATG (M)
2: TTT (F)
3: TAC (Y)
4: GCT (A)
5: ACT (T)
6: TCT (S)
7: GTG (V)
8: GAT (D)
9: ... (and so on until TGA)

Hmm, no stop codon.

Wait, maybe I've been looking at the wrong part. Let me look at the sequences again.

Original: ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant4: ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

So, no change there.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fifth codon from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). Gly is a small, non-reactive amino acid, while Thr is hydrophilic. Maybe this change disrupts a structural feature, like a helix or a loop, thereby inactivating the enzyme.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

I'm going to have to make a guess. Among the options, the best chance to disrupt the gene would be a frameshift or a stop codon. Since none introduces a stop codon, perhaps the correct answer is the one that has a frameshift.

Wait, but earlier I thought Mutant4 doesn't have a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me recount the nucleotides in the original and Mutant4.

Original: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant4: ...ACT CTT CTG TGG AT...

Original: 15 nucleotides (5 codons)
Mutant4: 12 nucleotides (4 codons)

Ah, so it's a three-nucleotide deletion. So, the number of nucleotides is 12 instead of 15. That is a frameshift of three nucleotides, which actually doesn't cause a frameshift because 15-12=3, which is a multiple of 3. So, the reading frame remains the same, but three codons are deleted.

Wait, so it's a deletion of three nucleotides, which would delete one codon. So, for example, the original has codon 3: CTC (Leu), and if it's deleted, the next codon becomes the third.

So, the deletion would remove one amino acid, but the rest would remain in frame. So, a single amino acid deletion.

But wait, in the given sequences, the number of nucleotides must be the same, because the entire gene is cloned. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 is a substitution, not a deletion.

Wait, looking again at the sequences:

Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant4: ...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the original has TCTCGCTGGTACT, and mutant4 has TTCTACGCTACT.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me write the original and mutant4 sequences for the affected region.

Original: T T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Mutant4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

So, in the original, positions after TTT are C G C T G G T A C T...

In Mutant4, after TTT, it's A C G C T A C T...

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution of three nucleotides. Let me see:

Original: ... TT C G C T G G T A C T ...

Mutant4: ... TT T A C G C T A C T ...

So, the sequence changes from C G C T to A C G.

Wait, perhaps a three-nucleotide substitution, which doesn't cause a frameshift but changes the amino acids.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a deletion of three nucleotides, but that would change the number of letters.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck again.

In the interest of time, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is D) Mutant4, because it has a mutation that deletes part of the exon, leading to a frameshift and a nonfunctional protein. Or perhaps it's Mutant2.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C) Mutant1 because it changes two codons in the beginning, which could disrupt the start of the protein.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Based on the options, I think the best guess is D) Mutant4, as it's the only one that possibly causes a frameshift or a major change in the reading frame.


The question involves identifying which mutation in the first exon of a gene would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by disrupting the gene's function. The gene consists of five exons and four introns, and the mutations are analyzed for their potential to alter the protein product, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly changing the amino acid sequence.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - Sequence changes: TTT → TCT (Phe → Ser), CTC → ACA (Leu → Thr).  
   - Both changes are missense mutations, altering amino acids but not introducing a stop codon or causing a frameshift.  
   - The reading frame remains intact, and the protein is likely still functional.

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - Sequence changes: TTT → TCT (Phe → Ser), CTC → AAG (Leu → Lys), GCT → CTT (Ala → Leu).  
   - Three missense mutations, altering amino acids but not introducing a stop codon or causing a frameshift.  
   - The reading frame remains intact, and the protein is likely still functional.

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - Sequence changes: TCT → TAC (Ser → Tyr), TCT → CAC (Ser → His).  
   - Two missense mutations, altering amino acids but not introducing a stop codon or causing a frameshift.  
   - The reading frame remains intact, and the protein is likely still functional.

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - Sequence changes: GCT → ACT (Ala → Thr), ACT → TCT (Thr → Ser).  
   - Two missense mutations, altering amino acids but not introducing a stop codon or causing a frameshift.  
   - The reading frame remains intact, and the protein is likely still functional.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon or cause a frameshift that would lead to a nonfunctional protein. All mutations are missense mutations that alter the amino acid sequence but do not completely disrupt the gene's function. Based on the analysis, **Mutant 4** is the most likely candidate to disrupt the gene's function due to the potential impact of the amino acid changes in the early region of the protein. However, this conclusion is not definitive without additional structural or functional context.
