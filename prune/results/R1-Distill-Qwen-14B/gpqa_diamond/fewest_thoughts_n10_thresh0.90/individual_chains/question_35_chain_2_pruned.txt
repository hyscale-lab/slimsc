Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to walk through this step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, and then determining which statement is correct among the options given.

Alright, the setup: Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So, let me write that down.

S matrix:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), that would make each element of S multiplied by that constant.

Wait, what's the intrinsic angular momentum operator? Oh right, for spin-½ particles, the angular momentum components are represented by matrices like Sx, Sy, Sz, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. But in this case, S is given as the matrix above, which I think is similar to the Pauli Y matrix but perhaps scaled somehow.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], so yes, S is exactly the Pauli Y matrix. So S = Y, and Ay = c * Y, with c = h/(4π). So, Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix.

Now, the problem asks to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me think about how that works.

Eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it should have two eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

But wait, since Ay is proportional to the Pauli Y matrix, I can find the eigenvalues of S first. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So S has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Then, Ay = c * S, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(±1). So a = c * 1 and a = c * (-1).

Calculating c: c = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but the options don't seem to have this. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts +/- 2πh and real parts +/- h/(4π). That doesn't seem right because the eigenvalues should be real or imaginary? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. So S is Hermitian, so Ay is Hermitian as well, since c is a real constant. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay should be real.

Wait, wait a second. No, wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix which is Hermitian? Let me check. The Pauli Y matrix is indeed Hermitian because its conjugate transpose is itself. Because the (1,2) element is -i, and the (2
