Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through step by step. 

The question says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. They ask for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I need to figure out what the diluted concentration of acetic acid is. So, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20, making it 40 cm³ total. The moles of acetic acid stay the same, right? 

Molarity is moles per liter. So moles of acetic acid initially would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Got that part.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. So, moles of acetic acid is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M, but wait, the volume is 40 mL, so 0.04 L. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L is 0.001 moles of acetic acid. 

NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed at equivalence is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added. 

But the question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the way to equivalence. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at that point, 2.5 mL of NaOH has been added. 

Now, when titrating a weak acid with a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So at any point during the titration, some of the acetic acid is neutralized to form acetate ions.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted. So, let's calculate the moles at that point. The total moles of acetic acid is 0.001. 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So NaOH has added 0.00025 moles of OH- (since NaOH is 1:1 with CH3COOH). 

So, the initial moles after dilution: CH3COOH = 0.001, and after adding 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.00025 moles, the reaction will convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So, the new moles are: 
CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
CH3COO^-: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume at this point is original 40 mL plus 2.5 mL: 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is log(1/(1.85e-5)). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is approximately 1.85 x 10^-5, so pKa is about 4.74 or something. Wait, more precisely: log(1.85e-5)= log(1.85) + log(1e-5)= 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328, so pKa is 4.74. Yeah.

So pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = 4.74 + log(0.3333). Log(0.333) is about -0.477, so 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. So approximately 4.26.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So the log is log(1/3) = log(0.333) which is approximately -0.477.

So pH is 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

Now, the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water.

The moles of acetate will be 0.001 moles, and the volume will be the initial 40 mL plus 10 mL of NaOH, so 50 mL or 0.05 L.

So concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But CH3COO^- is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The hydrolysis equation is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.

We can approximate that the [OH^-] is sqrt(Kb * C) because in the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is approximately 1.04e-5 M. Then pH is 14 - pOH.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4
