Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx. But this is relativistic, so I have to consider effects from special relativity, probably involving things like gamma factors or something.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of the mass. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about how to approach this.

In the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA². So the maximum speed would be when that's converted into (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, the question is relativistic, so maybe that's not the correct approach.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma times mc². So the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, energy is quantized, but since this is a classical problem, maybe it's treating energy as a continuous variable.

So, the potential energy at maximum amplitude A is (1/2)kA², but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy can't be treated the same. The total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, all energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA².

At the point of maximum speed, which would be when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium position (x=0), all potential energy is converted into kinetic. But relativistically, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, setting E = (gamma -1 ) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, no. Wait, in the classical case, E is (1/2)kA², which is the total energy. So in the relativistic case, the total energy would be the same, because the system's energy doesn't change—it's just that the kinetic energy depends on velocity.

So when the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So E = K = (gamma -1) mc². But E is (1/2)kA², so:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc²

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for gamma.

gamma = ( (1/2)kA² )/(mc²) ) + 1

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term. Let me call that term 'a' for simplicity.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Taking reciprocal on both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a)

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2

Hmm, so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1+a)^2 )

Wait, but a is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So substituting back,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Let me compute the denominator inside the square root:

1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = [2 m c^2 +k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, so (1 + a) is that, so (1 + a)^2 is [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

But perhaps it's easier to write v_max in terms of a. Let me compute 1/(1+a)^2:

1/(1+a)^2 is [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))]^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Looking at the options:

Option D says v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ) )^2 )

Which matches what I have here. So option D is looking correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A has 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m))^2 in the square root. The denominator doesn't have c^2, which doesn't make sense dimensionally because the term (k A^2)/(2 m) has units of velocity squared. So including it as in option A would have (1 - velocity^2/velocity^2) inside the denominator, which is okay, but in our case, the denominator includes 2 m c^2, so that's why option D is correct.

Option B: 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ). Hmm, the denominator inside is 1 - (something), but we have 1 + something in our case. So B is not matching.

Option C is the classical solution, which wouldn't hold relativistically.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must account for relativistic effects. The total energy of the system is conserved and includes both potential and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all energy is potential, \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic, which in the relativistic case is given by \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
