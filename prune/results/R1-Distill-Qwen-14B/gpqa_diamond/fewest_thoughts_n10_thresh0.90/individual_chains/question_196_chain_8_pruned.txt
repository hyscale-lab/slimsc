Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx. But this is relativistic, which probably means we need to consider effects from Einstein's theory of relativity, like how mass increases with speed.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass, v_max. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one. Let me think about how to approach this.

In a regular (non-relativistic) harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (where velocity is maximum) is (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The problem is relativistic, so I can't stop here.

In relativity, the mass increases with velocity. The relativistic mass m_rel is gamma times m, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the energy considerations must take this into account. The total energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, in this case, since the oscillator is in motion, maybe the potential energy is still kA²/2 at maximum displacement.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the force law F = -kx is still valid? Or does the force change when speeds get relativistic? Hmm, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, so I think F = -kx is still applicable.

But energy is a better approach. So the total mechanical energy should be conserved. At maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero because the mass is momentarily at rest. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic, which would be maximum velocity.

But wait, that's in the non-relativistic case. In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2 mv²), but something else. The total energy is gamma m c². So the total energy in the system should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, but is the potential energy in the relativistic case the same as (1/2)kA²? I'm a bit confused here. In special relativity, the potential energy might be treated the same way if the forces are weak and velocities are not too close to c. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the relativistic form of the harmonic oscillator, perhaps considering relativistic corrections.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the virial theorem, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of energy conservation again. At the maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is (1/2)k A². But in the relativistic case, the total energy must also account for the rest mass energy.

So total energy E = (gamma m) c² = rest energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, in the non-relativistic case, E is the sum of kinetic and potential. So in the relativistic case, perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest energy and potential, but that doesn't make sense because the potential is part of the mechanical energy, which is separate from the rest energy.

Wait, maybe I should model the situation: The total energy at x=A is E = (gamma(A) m c²) = (rest energy) + (potential energy). Or is it?

Wait, no. The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should be equal in all points. So at x = A, velocity is zero. So the mechanical energy E = (1/2)k A². At x=0, velocity is maximum, so mechanical energy is (gamma m v_max²)/2 (wait, but for kinetic energy, relativistic expression is (gamma - 1) m c². Hmm that's getting more complicated.)

Wait, wait. Let's clarify:

In the non-relativistic case, the mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA², and this equals (1/2)m v_max². So v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C, but that's for non-relativistic. The problem is relativistic, so we need to adjust.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total mechanical energy E is (gamma - 1) m c² + (1/2)k x². At x = A, velocity is zero, so mechanical energy is (gamma(A) - 1) m c² + (1/2)k A².

But wait, wait. No, because when x is maximum, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So the mechanical energy is purely potential energy.

Wait, no. The potential energy is (1/2)k x² as usual, but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c², which can't be zero when velocity isn't zero. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved, and is equal to the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential.

But when x is maximum, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium position (x=0), the velocity is maximum. So the kinetic energy is (gamma_max -1 ) m c², and the potential energy is zero. Therefore, E = (gamma_max - 1 ) m c².

Setting these equal: (gamma_max -1 ) m c² = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, term = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So,

gamma = 1 + term.

Hmm. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + term.

I can solve for v in terms of term. Let's square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + term)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + term)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + term)^2] = [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 term + term²) - 1 = 2 term + term^2.

So,

v²/c² = (2 term + term²) / (1 + term)^2.

But term is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's substitute that back in.

Numerator: 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))².

Simplify numerator:

= (k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator: (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ]^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

Let me compute numerator / denominator:

numerator = k A²/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) 

denominator = [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ]^2 

= ( (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ) / (4 m² c^4 )

So, putting together:

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)) ] * [4 m² c^4 / (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ]

Simplify each term:

Let me factor out k A²/(4 m² c^4) from the numerator inside the brackets:

Wait, perhaps a better approach.

First, factor the numerator:

numerator = (4 m c² * k A² + k² A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )

Wait, because when you have:

k A²/(m c²) = 4 m c² * k A² / (4 m² c^4 )

Similarly, the second term is (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So,

numerator = [4 m c² * k A² + k^2 A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

numerator = k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) / (4 m² c^4 )

Then,

numerator / denominator = [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] * [ 4 m² c^4 / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ]

Simplify:

The 4 m² c^4 cancels.

So,

= [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

But wait, 4 m c² + k A² is equal to 2*(2 m c²) + k A², but perhaps it's better to see if 4 m c² + k A² can be expressed as (2 m c² + k A² ) + 2 m c².

Hmm, not sure. Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )^2 

So,

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 

Hmm, maybe factor out (2 m c² + k A² ) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, 4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) + k A² = (2 m c²) + (2 m c² + k A² )

Not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor 2 m c² as a common term.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just write:

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

Let me factor 2 m c² as a term:

Wait, 4 m c² = 2*(2 m c²). So,

4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c²) + k A².

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should factor (2 m c² + k A² ) in terms of the denominator.

Wait, let me let (2 m c² + k A² ) = B. Then the denominator is B².

The numerator is k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) = k A² (2*(2 m c²) + k A² ) = k A² ( (2 m c²) + (2 m c² + k A²) )

= k A² (2 m c² + B ).

But perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express 4 m c² as (2 m c²)*2, so:

= [k A² * 2 m c² + k A² * k A² ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 

Wait, not sure. Another approach: let's factor out k A² from numerator.

Wait, numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) = k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )^2 = ( (2 m c²) + (k A²) )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write 4 m c² as 2*(2 m c²). So,

= [k A² (2*(2 m c²) + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

= [k A² * 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^4 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write
