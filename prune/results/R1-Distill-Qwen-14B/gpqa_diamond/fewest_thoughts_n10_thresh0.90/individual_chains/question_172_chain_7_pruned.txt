Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, waitâ€”excitation level usually relates to the Boltzmann distribution, right? Because in thermal equilibrium, the population of different energy levels depends on temperature. 

So the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The formula I remember is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations of the energy levels, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, and T is the temperature. Since we're comparing the same energy levels between the two stars, I think the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) would be the same for each star. So maybe the ratio simplifies.

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, because the energy levels are different, so E_i and E_j have a difference delta E. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state (or another level) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

But the question states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, for star_1, let's say n1_i is twice n2_i. Or wait, no. The problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). Or perhaps it's n1_i = 2 * n2_i? I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify.

Wait, it says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the number of atoms in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. But for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state (or another state) is determined by the Boltzmann factor.

So for a given star, the ratio of the number of excited atoms (n_i) to the lower energy state (n_j) is proportional to exp(-delta_E/(k T)). So for star 1, (n_i1)/(n_j1) = exp(-delta_E/(k T1)) multiplied by (g_i/g_j). Similarly, for star 2, (n_i2)/(n_j2) = exp(-delta_E/(k T2)) multiplied by (g_i/g_j). But since we're comparing the same energy levels, g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, so they would cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio of (n_i1/n_j1) to (n_i2/n_j2) is exp[ (delta_E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ].

Wait, wait. Let me get that right. For star 1, ratio is exp(-delta_E/(k T1)), and for star 2, it's exp( -delta_E/(k T2) ). So if the ratio (n_i1/n_j1) over (n_i2/n_j2) is given as 2, then:

(n_i1/n_j1) / (n_i2/n_j2) = 2 = [exp(-delta_E/(k T1))] / [exp(-delta_E/(k T2))] = exp[ delta_E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

So, 2 = exp( delta_E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take the natural log of both sides: ln(2) = delta_E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Wait, but delta_E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and k is the Boltzmann constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Let me write that down. k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So substituting delta_E = k * something? Wait, delta_E is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly equal to k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So delta_E = k * (1 K) ?

Wait, no, because k has units of J/K. So delta_E is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k multiplied by 1 K. So delta_E = k * T, where T is 1 K. So delta_E = k * (1 K).

So then, substituting back into the equation: ln(2) = (k * 1 K) / k * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, simplifying. The k's would cancel. So ln(2) = [ (1 K) / k ] * (1/T2 - 1/T1) * k? Wait, no, let me recheck.

Wait wait, no, delta_E is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k * T, where T is 1 K. So delta_E = k * T, so T would be 1 K. So delta_E = k * 1 K. So delta_E / k = 1 K.

So the equation becomes ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no, let me clarify. The equation is ln(2) = (delta_E / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Since delta_E = k * 1 K, delta_E/k is 1 K.

So ln(2) = (1 K) * ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1) * 1 K. Wait, but 1 K is just a number, so perhaps the equation simplifies to ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Alternatively, since (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) * (1 K) ?

Wait, no, because the term (1/T2 - 1/T1) is (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ). So,

ln(2) = (1 K) * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, but K is a unit, so perhaps the equation would be:

ln(2) = ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) * ( 1 K )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

We have:

ln(2) = (delta_E / (k)) * ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So delta_E is 1.38e-23 J. k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta_E / k = 1 K.

So,

ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

But 1 K is a unit of temperature, but in
