Okay, let's try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The scenario is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, so I'm dealing with the Boltzmann equation here, right? Because it's about the distribution of energy levels in thermal equilibrium (LTE is assumed here). The Boltzmann factor relates the population of energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-(E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T)). Oh wait, but in this problem, the ratio of excitation is given. So the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Let's think about that.

Let me denote the excitation as n_i for each star. So for star_1, n1 is twice that of star_2, n2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. The problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So I'm not sure if that's the population ratio. Let me read it again. Oh, it says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the number of atoms in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So, the ratio n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2. Or maybe it's n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 times the ratio for star_2, n_upper2 / n_lower2. Hmm, maybe I should model it as the ratio of the populations for each star relative to their own lower levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the ratio of the upper to lower states. So for each star, the excitation is n_upper / n_lower. For star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2. Let me get that clear.

So, let's denote for each star, the excitation ratio as:

x1 = (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) for star_1.

Similarly, x2 = (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) for star_2.

The problem says x1 = 2 * x
