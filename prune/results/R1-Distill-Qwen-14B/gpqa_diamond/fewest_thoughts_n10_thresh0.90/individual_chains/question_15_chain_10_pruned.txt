Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, transit method, right? That's when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, both Earth-like. They've been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period is related to distance via Kepler's third law. So Planet_1 is orbiting closer.

Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radius? Hmm. Mass doesn't always directly translate to radius in stars, but for main-sequence stars, more massive stars are bigger. But Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Oh, because slightly evolved stars might have expanded a bit, but in this case, both stars have the same radii. Interesting.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability depends on a few factors. I remember the formula for the transit probability is R_planet / R_star, squared, or maybe it's R_planet divided by (R_star) times something. Wait, no. Wait, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star. So the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is planet radius and R_s is star radius. Oh wait, but wait—that's not entirely accurate. Because the actual probability also depends on the orbital parameters, particularly the alignment. The probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, multiplied by (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular, e=0 so that part is 1. So the probability P is approximately (R_p / a) * (something?). Or wait, another formula I've heard is P = (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a) )? I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes directly in front of the star from our viewpoint. The probability is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by the probability of alignment, which is (R_p / a) * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) ), but again, since e=0 here. So perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a) * (something else). Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula, but since I can't, I'll try to remember.

Wait, another approach: the probability for a planet to transit is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 times (R_s / a) / (1/R_p?), no. I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), which would be (R_p / a)^2 * (R_s / a). No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, another way: the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but I might need to think about it differently.

Wait, okay, the transit probability is calculated as the ratio of the size of the planet to the size of the star, squared, but also considering the orbital distance. Because for a planet at a distance a from the star, the probability that it transits is (R_p / R_s)² * (1/(1 - (R_s/a)^2))^(1/2)) or something like that.
