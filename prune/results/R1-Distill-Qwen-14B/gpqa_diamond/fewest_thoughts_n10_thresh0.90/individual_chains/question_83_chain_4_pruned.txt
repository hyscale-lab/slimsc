Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking what the pH will be at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you titrate an acid with a base, the pH changes based on how much of the base has been added. At the equivalence point, all the acid has been neutralized by the base, forming the corresponding salt. In this case, acetic acid (CH3COOH) will react with NaOH to form acetate ions (CH3COO^-) and water.

But wait, the problem is in two parts: 25% titration and the equivalence point. So I need to calculate the pH for both scenarios.

First, let me think about the initial solution after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with another 20 cm³ of water will double the volume, so the concentration will be half. Let me calculate that.

Initial moles of acetic acid: Molarity * Volume (in liters) = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the volume needed for that.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001. Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001. Molarity = moles/volume → volume = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added. But the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, wait, 25% of what? 25% of the equivalence point volume? Because 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So that's the 25% titration.

Alternatively, sometimes the percentage refers to how much of the acid has been neutralized. So 25% of the acid has reacted with the base. Let me think. Hmm, in titration terms, the equivalence point is 100%, so 25% would be 25% of that. So yes, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH would be 25% titrated.

So for the first part, the 25% point. That means 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. So in the solution, some of the acetic acid will have been neutralized to acetate.

The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, adding 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of 0.1 M NaOH. Let me compute the moles of NaOH added.

Moles NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH to produce a mole of CH3COO^-.

So, the initial moles in the diluted solution: 0.001 mol CH3COOH. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and the moles of CH3COO^- will increase by 0.00025.

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by the Ka: 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.738 (because log(1.85e-5)= -4.735, so pKa=4.735? Wait, wait. No, pKa is -log(Ka). So Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa= about 4.73.

Wait, let me compute it accurately. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. The log of that is log(1.85) + log(10^-5) → 0.2672 -5 → -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) → let's compute the ratio.

0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Because 0.005882 is about 1/17.647, but wait, 0.005882 is 2.5e-3, and 0.017647 is approximately 7.5e-3? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's compute that: 0.00075 ÷ 0.
