Okay, so I've got this question about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but let's think this through.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2's. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that each small region of the photosphere is in equilibrium with the local radiation field.

So, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in energy states i and j.

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. But wait, for the Boltzmann factor, it's the ratio of the populations that matters. The question says that star_1 has twice as excited atoms as star_2. So I'm assuming that the excitation here refers to the population in the higher energy level.

Let me clarify: let's say for each star, the iron atoms are in two energy levels, level 1 (lower energy) and level 2 (higher energy). The ratio of populations between level 2 and level 1 will depend on the temperature of the star.

So for star 1, let's denote the ratio as n2_1 / n1_1 = 2, since it's twice as excited. For star 2, maybe n2_2 / n1_2 = 1 (assuming the base case), or perhaps I need to set up the ratio between the two stars. Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited, implying that the ratio (n2/n1) is higher in star_1 than in star_2.

Wait, no, the exact wording is that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Oh, wait, perhaps they're referring to the same energy level in both stars? That might not make sense. Or perhaps the excitation is for a transition between two levels, but the question is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think it's that for a particular energy level, the excitation (i.e., the population) is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

So, if we take the ratio for each star, for the same energy level, the population is different. But wait, the Boltzmann factor is for a transition between two specific energy levels. Hmm.

Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor gives the ratio between two energy levels in the same star. So perhaps for each star, the ratio of the higher energy level to the lower one is given by the Boltzmann equation, and we can set up equations for star_1 and star_2.

Let me denote for star_1: (n2_1)/(n1_1) = 2. For star_2, perhaps (n2_2)/(n1_2) = 1, or maybe it's a different ratio. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we're comparing the excitation in the same energy level across two stars. Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense because the same level in different stars would have different populations based on their temperatures.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the excitation of the same energy level (say, level 2) is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So if we take the number of atoms in level 2 for star_1 as n2_1 and for star_2 as n2_2, then n2_1 = 2 n2_2.

But then, how do the temperatures come into play? Because each star has its own temperature, T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is comparing the excitation relative to the ground state. So for star_1, the ratio (n2/n1) is 2, and for star_2, it's 1. So:

For star_1: (n2_1)/(n1_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Set this equal to 2.

For star_2: (n2_2)/(n1_2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Assuming that for star_2, the excitation is lower, perhaps (n2_2)/(n1_2) is 1? Or maybe not. Maybe the ratio is different.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level
