Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions of the adamantane framework. Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. I think KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction or some kind of dehydrohalogenation. Oh wait, in the presence of KOH, especially in such conditions, dibromides often undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules and form an alkene. But wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Hmm, another possibility is that this is a Hofmann elimination, but that's when you have amines. Wait, no, wait, for vicinal dihalides, elimination would form an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a dihalide with bromines on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, 1 and 3 positions in adamantane are not adjacent. Wait, adamantane's structure is like four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1 and 3 might be two carbons apart. So maybe when KOH is used, it's a double elimination, leading to the formation of an allene or maybe a cyclo structure. Wait, but the IR spectrum of product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl group, right? So maybe it's not elimination; perhaps it's dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone. Oh wait, but wait, if you have two Br atoms, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation twice, but that would form an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, so maybe it's a substitution reaction?

Wait, KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's a double elimination, forming an alkene, but where would the carbonyl come from? Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, so perhaps it's undergoing dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but that wouldn't produce a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fries rearrangement? No, that's for aryl esters. Wait, maybe it's a double elimination, but perhaps it's a ring-opening or something else.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is probably a ketone. How does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Hmm, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes. Oh wait, wait. What if it's a ring contraction or expansion? Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of an epoxide, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to an elimination of HBr twice, but perhaps in such a way that a carbonyl is formed. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when a dibromide is treated with a strong base like KOH, sometimes it can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group via elimination. For example, if the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But if there are two adjacent bromides, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction of 1,3-dibromocyclohexane with KOH. Wait, but in that case, elimination would form 1,3-cyclohexadiene, but that's not a ketone. Hmm.
