Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors: the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that cancels out. That simplifies things a bit.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). But since the albedo is the same for both, I can ignore that part when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the square root of (R_star / a) divided by the same for the other planet, but wait, no—actually, each planet's distance a affects it. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of each planet's a and then find the ratio.

Wait, the formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ). Wait, is that right? Or is it T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )? Let me think. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is involved. The star emits energy proportional to T^4 * R^2 / a^2 (since flux is L/(4pi a²), and L is sigma*T^4 *4pi R_star²). Then the planet absorbs that, but reflects some due to albedo. The absorbed energy is sigma*T_p^4 *4 pi R_p² = (L/4pi a²) * (1 - A) * pi R_p^2. Wait, maybe the equilibrium is when absorbed equals emitted by the planet. Let's see.

So, the energy the planet absorbs is (L*(1 - A))/(4 a²) * π R_p², because the cross-section is π R_p². The energy the planet emits is 4π R_p² σ T_p^4. So setting them equal:

(L (1 - A) π R_p²) / (4 a²) ) = 4 π R_p² σ T_p^4.

Simplify: L (1-A)/(4 a²) = 4 σ T_p^4.

L is 4π R_star² σ T_star^4. So substituting that in:

4π R_star² σ T_star^4 * (1-A) / (4 a²) ) = 4 σ T_p^4.

Simplify the equation: The 4 and 4 cancel. So:

π R_star² σ T_star^4 (1-A) / (a²) ) = 4 σ T_p^4.

Divide both sides by σ:

π R_star² T_star^4 (1-A) / a² = 4 T_p^4.

So T_p^4 = (π R_star² T_star^4 (1-A)) / (4 a²).

Take the fourth root:

T_p = T_star * ( (π R_star^2 (1-A) ) / (4 a²) )^(1/4).

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me see if there's a simpler form. Alternatively, I think the equilibrium temperature can be approximated as T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4).

Wait, let me double-check. The formula I often see is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). So that's the formula we can use here since A is the same for both planets.

So the ratio of T1 to T2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) multiplied by ( (1-A1)/(1-A2) )^(1/4). Since A is same, that part is 1. So the ratio simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 ).

Wait, because (R_star/(2a1 )) divided by (R_star/(2a2)) is (a2/a1), so the sqrt of that is sqrt(a2/a1). So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ).

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. If T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(a)), then T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(a1)) / (R_star/(a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). So yes, ratio is sqrt(a2/a1).

So to find the ratio T1/T2, I need the ratio of a2 to a1, under the square root. So I need to find a1 and a2.

Wait, but how do I find a1 and a2? The question gives us information about
