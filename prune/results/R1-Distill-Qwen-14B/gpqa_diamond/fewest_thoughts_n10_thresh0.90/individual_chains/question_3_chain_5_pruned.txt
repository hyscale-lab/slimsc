Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember some key concepts.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, I should check if that state is normalized. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square them and add. 0.25 + (3/4) is 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Oh, right, so it's normalized. Good.

The operator in question is 10σz + 5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state.

Since expectation is linear, I can break this down into two parts: the expectation of 10σz plus the expectation of 5σx. So, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Let me handle each term separately.

First, σz. The eigenstates of σz are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, right? So, for σz, the expectation value in state |↑⟩ is +1 and in |↓⟩ is -1. Because σz|↑⟩ = +|↑⟩, and σz|↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let's compute that.

(0.5)^2 is 0.25, multiplied by 1 gives 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75, multiplied by -1 gives -0.75. Adding them together, 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

So the first term is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the operator is 10σz, but the expectation value of σz is -0.5, so 10 times that is -5. Hmm, that's correct.

Now, the second part is 5⟨σx⟩. I need to find ⟨σx⟩.

Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are the states that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But wait, our state is in the σz basis. So maybe I need to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ directly.

Alternatively, I can express σx in the σz basis. The Pauli matrices are:

σz is diagonal, σx is off-diagonal. σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]. 

So to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can write ψ as a column vector. Let's see: |↑⟩ is (1;0), |↓⟩ is (0;1). So ψ is 0.5*(1;0) + sqrt(3)/2*(0;1) = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So the vector ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σx is the matrix:

[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

So σx |ψ⟩ would be [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2), (1)(0.5) + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) ]^T = [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]^T.

Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the inner product of ψ with σx|ψ⟩. So ψ† * σx |ψ⟩.

ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, that can't be right because when I compute it, let me do it again.

Wait, ψ is [a, b]^T, where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

σx|ψ⟩ is [b, a]^T.

So ψ† σx |ψ⟩ is a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2 ) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*( sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So then, the second term is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Wait, no, wait: 5 times that is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2 ), which is 5*(approx 0.866) = approx 4.33.

Then, summing the two terms: -5 + 4.33 = -0.666..., which is approximately -0.67.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the expectation value of σx is 2ab, where a and b are the components of the state in |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

So 2ab = 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2 ) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) * 2? Wait, 2 * 0.5 is 1, so 1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2. So yes, that's correct.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Thus, the expectation value of 5σx is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

So the total expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2 )= (-5) + (5*1.732/2) )= -5 + (8.66/2)= -5 +4.33= -0.666..., so approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

Wait, my calculation gives -0.666..., so approximately -0.67, which is close to option C) -0.7. But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, exact value is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2 )= -5 + (5 * 1.73205/2 )= -5 + (8.66025/2 )= -5 +4.330125= -0.669875. So approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 to one decimal place. So option C is -0.7, which is close.

Wait, but wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ⟨σx⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the formula for expectation value in a spin-1/2 system.

Another approach: The expectation value of σx is ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ) no, wait, wait, no. Wait, the expectation value of σx is ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) for spin in σz basis? No, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, for a general state ψ = a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b ), because σx has off-diagonal terms.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the formula. Let me express the state as a vector, then multiply by σx, then take the inner product.

Wait, my previous calculation gave ⟨σx⟩ as (sqrt(3)/2 ) ≈ 0.866. So 5 times that is about 4.33. So 10σz gives -5, adding 5σx gives -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the answer should be option C) -0.7.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩: the expectation value is (a b* + a* b ). Because σx in the σz basis has off-diagonal elements, so:
