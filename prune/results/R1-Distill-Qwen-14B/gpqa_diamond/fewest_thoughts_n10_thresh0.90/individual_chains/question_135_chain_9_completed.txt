Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure how that factors into the decay possibilities. Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe that tells me which fermions interact with X. 

So, X is a boson, so it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The mass of X is 6 GeV. The possible decay products are pairs of fermions whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So I need to find all fermion pairs where each fermion's mass is less than 6 GeV/2, because each would need to be less than or equal to half the mass to allow the decay. Wait, or is it that the sum of their masses must be less than X's mass? Oh right, because when a particle at rest decays, the energy available is its rest mass. So the total invariant mass of the decay products can't exceed the mass of the parent particle.

Wait, no, wait. The rest mass of the parent is X's mass, 6 GeV. For the decay X → f f̄, the condition is that 2m_f ≤ m_X. Because each fermion has mass m_f, so 2m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let me list all the known fermion masses. Let me think:

- Electron (e): mass is about 0.0005 GeV. So definitely less than 3 GeV.
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV.
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV.
- Up quark (u): very light, around 2 MeV, so <<3 GeV.
- Down quark (d): also light, around 4-5 MeV. Also way less.
- Strange (s): about 100 MeV, so 0.1 GeV.
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV. Oh wait, 1.5 is less than 3, so yes.
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV. Oh, wait, 4.5 is more than 3 GeV, so 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b quarks can't be produced in the decay.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV. So definitely way beyond.

So which fermions have m_f ≤ 3 GeV? Let's see:

Electron, muon, tau, up, down, strange, charm. Those are the possible candidates.

Wait, but some of these are quarks. So when the boson X decays, it can produce any fermion pair as long as the sum is under 6 GeV. But wait, the Lagrangian given must affect which fermions X can interact with. Because the interaction term is λ f ψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Let me parse that.

The term looks like it's written in terms of some field f. Wait, perhaps it's λ multiplied by f, which is a fermion field. Let me think about the structure.

The interaction term is -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Maybe the term is -λ f ψ^dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the term is written as -λ f (ψ̄_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y)) times (v + X(y)).

Wait, perhaps the interaction is proportional to X(y) ψ̄_f(y) ψ_f(y). So X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So in that case, X can decay into any fermion pair ψ_f and ψ_f bar, provided that 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So which fermions can X couple to? The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which would be the fermions that X interacts with. So perhaps X can decay into any of these fermion pairs where m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So for each fermion pair, their mass must be ≤ 3 GeV. So for each possible fermion f, 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV. So let's list the fermions and their masses:

- e⁻: ~0.0005 GeV. So yes.
- μ⁻: ~0.1 GeV. Yes.
- τ⁻: ~1.78 GeV. Yes.
- u: ~2 MeV. Yes.
- d: ~4 MeV. Yes.
- s: ~100 MeV. Yes.
- c: ~1.5 GeV. Yes.
- b: ~4.5 GeV. No, since 2*4.5 = 9 GeV >6 GeV.
- t: no way.

So the possible fermion pairs X can decay into are:

e⁺e⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, τ⁺τ⁻, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but the option choices don't include all of these. Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, e⁺e⁻.

But wait, b's mass is 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b=9 GeV which is way above the X's mass of 6 GeV. So option A is incorrect because it includes b b̄.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻.

So that's all the allowed fermion pairs except the top quark. But wait, option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is exactly 6 GeV? Wait, m_c is about 1.5 GeV, right? So 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6 GeV, so yes. So c c̄ is allowed.

But wait, wait. Wait, X can decay into any of these, but the interaction term must allow it. The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which are the fermions X can couple to. Suppose the interaction term is written as X ψ̄ ψ, so X couples to all these fermions. So all the pairs are possible.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed except b and t.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e. But b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, 173 GeV, so that's impossible. So C is wrong.

So the only correct option is B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The X has mass 6 GeV. The maximum allowed for a fermion is 3 GeV. So which fermions are under 3 GeV? Let's list them:

e (0.0005), mu (0.1), tau (1.78), up (2 MeV), down (4 MeV), strange (100 MeV), charm (1.5 GeV). So all these have m_f < 3 GeV. So all these fermion pairs are allowed.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all of them except the b and t.

Option A includes b, which is a no-go. So option B is the correct one.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \), and the decay \( X \rightarrow f\bar{f} \) is allowed if the total mass of the decay products satisfies \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). 

Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition becomes \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). The masses of known fermions are as follows:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \))
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (far exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \))

From this, the fermions \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \) satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), making their corresponding fermion-antifermion pairs kinematically allowed. The decays \( X \rightarrow b\bar{b} \) and \( X \rightarrow t\bar{t} \) are forbidden because \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes only the kinematically allowed decays.

Answer: B
