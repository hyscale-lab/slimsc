Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule's energy states and photon momentum. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can be modeled as both a rotor and a vibrator. The question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Right, because in a diatomic molecule, the bond can stretch and compress, so it's not rigid.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest energy state. The question asks what momentum a photon must have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. So I need to find the photon's momentum that allows this transition.

Given data:
- Mass of X (Mx) is 20 amu.
- Mass of Y (My) is 2 amu.
- Bond length (R) is 2 angstroms.
- Angular frequency (ω) is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that means we're looking for the smallest possible energy increment, which would be the first overtone or something. But wait, in rotational and vibrational states, the transitions are quantized. So I need to consider both vibrational and rotational energy levels.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state for a diatomic is the state with the lowest vibrational energy and the lowest rotational energy. So that would be the ground state of both the rotation and vibration. So the next state would be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

I think the question is combining both rotation and vibration. So the molecule is in the state where both vibrational and rotational are in their lowest states. When it absorbs a photon, it can either go to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, that probably refers to the next higher energy state overall, whether it's vibrational or rotational. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the current state and the next possible state, whichever is the smallest energy increment.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the energy is E = B J (J+1) + (N + 1/2) ħω, where B is the rotational constant, J is the rotational quantum number, and N is the vibrational quantum number.

Wait, but the fundamental state would be the state where J=0 and N=0. So the next state would be either J=1 (next rotational state) or N=1 (next vibrational state). So I need to calculate the energy difference between the current state (J=0, N=0) and the next possible states, and see which one has the lower energy difference, and that's what the photon should match.

So let's compute the energy of the current state and the next states.

Wait, no, the current state is the fundamental, so E_initial = (0+1/2) ħω + B*0*(0+1) = (1/2) ħω. The next states could be either N=1 (vibrational first excited), J=1 (rotational first excited), or a combination like J=1, N=0. But which of these has the smallest energy difference?

Wait, but for the next state with the lowest possible energy, the photon's energy must match the smallest possible energy transition. So I need to find the minimum energy difference between the current state and any higher state.

So I'll compute the energy difference for each possible transition and choose the smallest one.

First, calculate the rotational constant B. B is given by (ħ²)/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², and μ is the reduced mass.

So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. But wait, I need it in kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me calculate that: 20/11 is about 1.818. 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.013e-27 kg? Wait,

Wait, 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

Similarly, My is 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Wait no, that's not correct. μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My), but Mx and My are in kg.

So Mx = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Wait, that's (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.653e-26) kg.

Wait, 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = approx 1.103e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ = 1.103e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = approx 3.017e-27 kg.

Ok, so I = μ R². R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then B is (ħ²)/(2I). Planck's constant ħ is h-bar = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.207e-46) )

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 = approx 4.608e-23 J.

But wait, let me double-check the computation.

Wait, 1.05457e-34 squared is:

(1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46) = 1.112 / 2.414 = approx 0.4607e-22 = 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponents. Let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1e-34 squared is 1e-68. So 1.05457e-34 squared is approximately (1.05457)^2 = 1.112, times 1e-68, so 1.112e-68.

Then, 2I is 2*(3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 ). Wait, I think I made a miscalculation here earlier.

Wait, let's compute I again more accurately.

R is 2e-10 m.

μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) in kg. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So Mx = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 33.21e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 kg).

Adding the denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

Multiply numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 → approximately 11.03 * 1e-53 = 1.103e-52 kg² m²/s²? Wait, no, units are kg².

Wait, I think the numerator is (3.321e-26 kg) * (3.321e-27 kg) = 1.103e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ = 1.103e-52 kg² / 3.6531e-26 kg = 3.017e-27 kg.

Now, I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Now, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34 J s)^2/(2 * 1.2068e-46 kg m²).

Compute the numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.2068e-46 = 2.4136e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.4136e-46) J.

Wait, units for B should be in Joules because I is in kg m², and ħ²/(2I) would have units J.

So 1.112e-68 / 2.4136e-46 = (1.112/2.4136) * 1e-22 → approx 0.4608 * 1e-22 = 4.608e-23 J.

Hmm, okay, so B is about 4.608e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing ΔE_vibrational = ħ ω. Since ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ħ = 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ΔE_vibrational = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, that's the energy difference for a vibrational transition from N=0 to N=1.

Now, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), with J=0,1,2,...

So the energy difference when J goes from 0 to 1 is E_rot = B*(1)(2) - B*(0)(1) = 2B - 0 = 2B.

So ΔE_rotational = 2B = 2 *4.608e-23 J = 9.216e-23 J.

Now, the photon must have enough energy to cause the molecule to transition to the next state, which requires the smallest possible energy. Comparing ΔE_vibrational and ΔE_rotational:

ΔE_vibrational is 4.218e-20 J, and ΔE_rotational is 9.216e-23 J.

Since 4.218e-20 is way bigger than 9.216e-23, the rotational transition would require less energy. Therefore, the photon's energy must match the rotational transition, which is lower.

Wait, but wait. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state (lowest energy), and wants to switch to the next state with the lowest
