Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about a diatomic molecule, made of elements X and Y. They can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, wait. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state would probably be the first excited state. But I'm a bit confused about what transitions are allowed. Oh right, in rotational and vibrational spectroscopy, the selection rules determine which transitions are possible. I remember that for rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. But wait, this is a rotation-vibration model, so maybe both vibrational and rotational transitions are involved.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and it's switching to the next state. Oh, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be either v=1 or J=1? Or perhaps a combination. Wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of vibrational and rotational states. So the next state would be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So maybe the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), and the next state with the lowest energy would be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which one has lower energy? Let me think about the energies.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vibrational = (v + 1/2) ħω. The rotational energy is E_rotational = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

For a diatomic molecule, the moment of inertia I is μr², where μ is the reduced mass, r is the bond length. So I can calculate μ first.

Masses are given: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So the total mass is 22 amu. Wait, but the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let me calculate that.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh wait, but I need to convert this into kilograms because the units for momentum are in N·s, which is kg·m/s.

So 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (approx 1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988e-27 kg). Wait, but wait, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27:

Calculating 1.818 * 1.6605 = approximately 1.818 * 1.66 ≈ 2.999, so about 3.0e-27 kg? Hmm, precise calculation later.

Next step: the bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ * R². Let's compute that. I = (3e-27 kg) * (2e-10)^2 = 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 12e-47 kg m².

Wait, let me be more precise. The reduced mass I need to compute accurately.

So Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (22) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Let me compute that:

1.81818 * 1.660539 ≈ Let me compute 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 1.818 *1.66 is about 2.999, but let me do it more accurately.

1.81818 * 1.660539:

Break it down:

1.8 *1.660539 = approx 2.989 (since 1.8*1.66 is 2.988).

0.01818 *1.660539 ≈ approx 0.02999.

So total is about 2.989 + 0.03 ≈ 3.019. So around 3.019e-27 kg.

Wait, more accurately: 1.81818 * 1.660539 = let me calculate.

1.81818 * 1.660539:

= (1 + 0.8 + 0.01818) * 1.660539

Wait, perhaps better to compute 1.81818 * 1.660539:

Well, 1.81818 * 1.660539 ≈ 3.0185e-27 kg.

So I = μ r² = 3.0185e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0185e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2074e-46 kg m².

Now, the energy levels for rotational states are E_rot = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I).

The vibrational energy is E_vib = (v + ½) ħ ω.

So the total energy is E = E_rot + E_vib.

In the fundamental state, v=0 and J=0. So E_initial = ½ ħ ω + (0)(1) ħ²/(2I) = ½ ħ ω.

The next state would be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Which one has lower energy than the other? Let's compute both.

First, compute the energy for v=1, J=0:

E1_v = (1 + ½) ħ ω = (3/2) ħ ω.

E1_rot = (0)(1) ħ²/(2I) = 0.

So total E1 = (3/2) ħ ω.

For the state v=0, J=1:

E2_v = (0 + ½) ħ ω = ½ ħ ω.

E2_rot = (1)(2) ħ²/(2I) )= (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So E2 = ½ ħ ω + ħ²/(I).

Now, we need to see which is smaller: E1 or E2.

Compute the two:

E1 = (3/2) ħ ω.

E2 = (½) ħ ω + ħ²/(I).

So the question is, is (3/2) ħ ω larger than [ (1/2) ħ ω + ħ²/(I) ] ?

Let's compute the difference: 

E1 - E2 = (3/2) ħ ω - [ (1/2) ħ ω + ħ²/(I) ] = ( ħ ω ) - ( ħ² / I )

So if this is positive, E1 > E2, meaning the next state with the lowest energy is E2 (v=0, J=1). If negative, E1 is lower.

Wait, let me compute (ħ ω) and (ħ²/I) numerically.

Given that ω is 4e14 rad/s.

Let me compute ħ² / I.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I is 1.2074e-46 kg m².

So ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.2074e-46) ≈ 9.206e-23 J.

Now, compute ħ ω.

ħ ω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So E1 - E2 = 4.218e-20 J - 9.206e-23 J = 4.125e-20 J.

Which is positive (since 4.218e-20 > 9.206e-23). So E1 - E2 is positive, which means E1 > E2.

Therefore, the state with v=0, J=1 has lower energy than v=1, J=0. So the next lowest state is (v=0, J=1). Therefore, the photon should cause a transition to this state.

So the energy difference is ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [ ½ ħ ω + ħ²/(I) ] - [ ½ ħ ω ] = ħ²/(I).

So the photon's energy must be equal to ΔE.

But wait, wait. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy is J=1, v=0.

So the energy change is ΔE = E(J=1, v=0) - E(J=0, v=0) ) = [ ½ ħ ω + (ħ²/(I)) ] - [½ ħ ω + 0 ] = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE = ħ²/(I).

So the photon's energy must be equal to this ΔE.

Energy of photon E_photon = ħ²/(I).

But the question asks for the momentum of the photon, not the energy. Hmm, photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. So p = E/(c).

So once I compute E_photon, I can find p.

So let's compute E_photon = ħ²/(I).

We already calculated ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.206e-23 J.

So p = E_photon / c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.206e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.068e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, earlier I had:

I = μ * R².

μ was calculated as approximately 3.0185e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m. So R² = 4e-20 m².

I = 3.0185e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2074e-46 kg m².

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s² (since J = kg m²/s², but more accurately, J is kg m²/s², so ħ has units J·s.)

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute ħ²/(I) in Joules.

So ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 (J^2 s^2).

I = 1.2074e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/(I) = (1.112e-68 J² s² ) / (1.2074e-46 kg m²) )

Wait, but wait, the units: J = kg m²/s². So J * s = kg m²/s.

So ħ has units J s. So ħ² has units (J s)^2 = J² s^2.

Wait, but when you compute ħ²/(I), units are (J² s²) / (kg m²) ). Let me compute the units:

J = kg m²/s².

So J² s² = (kg^2 m^4 /s^4) ) * s^2 = kg^2 m^4 / s^2.

Divided by kg m²: (kg^2 m^4 / s^2) ) / (kg m^2 ) ) = kg m^2 / s^2.

Which is J, so the result is in Joules. Correct.

So the value is (1.112e-68) / (1.2074e-46) ) ≈ 9.206e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.206e-23 J.

Now, p_photon = E_photon / c.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So p_photon = 9.206e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

J is kg m²/s², so kg m²/s² divided by m/s is kg m/s. So yes, correct.

So p = (9.206e-23) / (3e8) = 3.068e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are much larger, like 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns. Wait, but 1 Ns is kg m/s. So that's the same as momentum's unit.

So my calculation gives p ≈ 3e-31 kg m/s, but none of the options are that small. So what's wrong here?

Hmm. Let me see. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the state. Maybe the allowed transition isn't to J=1, but to a vibrational state.

Wait, maybe I should consider the vibrational transition as the next state. Because in the rotational transition, the energy difference is higher, but perhaps the selection rules allow vibrational transitions as well.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition gives a lower energy than the vibrational one. So why isn't that the right answer?

Wait, the options are all around 1e-27 Ns, which is 1e-27 kg m/s. My calculation got 3e-31 kg m/s, which is much smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Maybe the question is about the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

Wait, perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which accounts for vibration. Or maybe in this model, the molecule can change both rotational and vibrational states upon photon absorption.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the photon is absorbed, causing the molecule to transition from the ground state to the next possible state, which could involve both vibrational and rotational changes.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the fundamental vibrational state, so the next is the first excited vibrational state (v=1), regardless of J.

Wait, going back to the question statement: it says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), so E = ½ ħ ω + 0. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

Earlier, I calculated that the energy for J=1, v=0 is lower than v=1, J=0. So the photon would have to supply the energy difference for J=1, v=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply considering a vibrational transition, without considering rotational. But that doesn't make sense because in the non-rigid rotor model, both are considered.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot. Let me recheck that.
