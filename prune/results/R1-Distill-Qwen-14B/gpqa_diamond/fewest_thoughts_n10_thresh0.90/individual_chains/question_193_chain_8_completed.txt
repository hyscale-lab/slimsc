Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, the formula given is number of stars proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, parallax and distance are related, right? I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, so plx = 1/r where r is the distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So, I need to find how the number of stars depends on r. Let's think about the relationships step by step.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So the reciprocal of that would be r^5. Therefore, N ∝ r^5?

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me double-check. If plx = 1/r, then plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So 1/(plx^5) is 1/(1/r^5) = r^5. So yes, N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so perhaps it's about the number density, like stars per unit volume or something. Or is it about the number of stars in a shell of radius r with thickness dr? Because if you're looking at a region, the number of stars could depend on the volume, which depends on r squared times thickness, but maybe not.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given parallax, N is proportional to plx^(-5). But parallax is inversely proportional to r, so plx = 1/r. Substituting that in, N ∝ (1/r)^(-5) = r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5.

Wait, but does that make sense in terms of star distribution? I mean, usually, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume, which scales as r^3. But here, the relationship is different because it's a specific relation given, 1/plx^5. So perhaps in this scenario, the number of stars isn't following the typical volume-based scaling but a different one.

So the question is about how N changes with r. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But wait, wait a second, that seems counterintuitive because at larger distances, you'd think fewer stars are observed (since they're farther and dimmer). But this question is about the specific relation given, so maybe it's a hypothetical scenario.

So according to the given relation, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So when r increases, N increases as the fifth power. Looking at the options, option B is ~r^5. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse the exponents. 1 over plx^5 becomes r^5 when plx is 1/r. So 1/(1/r^5) = r^5. So yes, N goes as r^5. So the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power. So the correct option is B.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

Thus, the number of stars in the region increases with distance as \( r^5 \). This result directly follows from the given proportionality and the substitution of \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Among the provided options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^5 \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
