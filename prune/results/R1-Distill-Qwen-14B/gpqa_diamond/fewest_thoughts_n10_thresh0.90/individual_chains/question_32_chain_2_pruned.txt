Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see what I remember about relativistic mechanics.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6. 

The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC when the speed v is 0.96c. I remember that relativistic energy formulas involve gamma, which is the Lorentz factor. The total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy, right?

Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let me compute gamma first. Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in.

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². 

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Let me double-check that calculation because I don't want to make a mistake here.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yeah, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98, which is close to 1. Wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 = 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is needed. The rest mass energy E_rest = m c². But I need the mass m of the Li-6 nucleus. Li has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and neutrons are similar. Wait, but the exact mass might need to be considered for precision, but maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleons. Or perhaps it's given earlier? Wait, the problem doesn't provide the mass, so I might need to calculate it.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think about that. The molar mass of Li is about 7 g/mol, but Li-6 is a specific isotope. So the mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. Let me look up (in
