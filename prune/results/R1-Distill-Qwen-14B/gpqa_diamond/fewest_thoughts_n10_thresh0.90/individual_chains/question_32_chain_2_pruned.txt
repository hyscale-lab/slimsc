Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me understand what the problem is about. RHIC collides heavy ions, and here the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, Li is lithium. Oh wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make the isotope Li-6, right? Because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the nucleus in question is a Li-6 nucleus.

So, the speed of the nucleus is given as 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy isn't just kinetic but also includes their rest mass energy. So I think I need to calculate the total relativistic energy of the nucleus.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the equation to find gamma.

Let me calculate gamma first. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 0.28 times 3.5714 should be about 1. 0.28 * 3.5714 = 1. That seems right. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The nucleus's mass is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of approximately 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, wait. I think the exact mass might matter here, but perhaps the standard value is used. Alternatively, maybe I can look up the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. But I don't have that information, so perhaps I have to approximate.

Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for 3 protons, that's 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV. For 3 neutrons, 3 * 939.565 ≈ 2818.695 MeV. Adding them together, 2814 + 2818.695 ≈ 5632.695 MeV. So the rest mass energy m0c² is approximately 5632.695 MeV, which is 5.632695 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the exact composition is the correct approach. Maybe the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is given as a specific value. I recall that the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is around 938 MeV/c², but perhaps for the nucleus, the mass is slightly less due to binding energy. But since the problem is about high-energy physics, maybe we're supposed to use the sum of individual nucleon masses to approximate the nucleus's rest mass? Or perhaps use the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that the mass number A is 6 for Li-6. The mass of a nucleus is given by the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But I'm not sure if I should calculate that here. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to treat the nucleus as having a mass equal to 6 times the mass of a proton, since each neutron is very close in mass to a proton.

So, if each nucleon is about 938 MeV/c², 6 nucleons would be 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Close to the earlier calculation. So perhaps the rest mass energy is approximately 5.63 GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m0c². Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.63 GeV. Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.63: Let me compute step by step.

3 *5.63 is 16.89.

0.5714 *5.63: 0.5 *5.63 is 2.815, 0.0714 *5.63 is approximately 0.404. So 2.815 + 0.404 = 3.219.

So total E ≈ 16.89 +3.219 = 20.109 GeV.

Wait, but let me do it more accurately. 3.5714 multiplied by 5.63.

Breaking it down:

3.5714 *5 = 17.857

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 *0.03 = 0.107142

Adding them together: 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0 (approx) then +0.107142 gives about 20.107142
