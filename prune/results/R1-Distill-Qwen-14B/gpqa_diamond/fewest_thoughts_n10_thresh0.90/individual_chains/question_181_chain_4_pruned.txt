Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III branch of nuclear reactions in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find the ratio flux1/flux2.

Wait, I remember that the pp chain is responsible for most of the Sun's energy production. The pp chain has several branches, but the III branch is one of them. Oh right, the pp-I, II, and III are different steps in the proton-proton fusion process. The pp-III branch is where three protons fuse into a helium-3 nucleus, and then two helium-3 nuclei combine to make helium-4 and two protons. Or wait, no, maybe that's the main one. Anyway, the point is that if this branch stops, some neutrinos would be affected.

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the fusion processes. In the Sun, the main neutrinos are from the beta decay steps in the pp chain and the CNO cycle. Oh, right, in the pp chain, a significant number of neutrinos are produced in the pp-III branch. So if that branch stops suddenly, the production of those neutrinos would abruptly cease.

Now, the neutrino flux from the Sun is made up of contributions from different energy regions. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos at certain energies, and if it stops, that specific part of the flux would drop. But wait, the problem says that all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III branch is stopped.

Wait, but neutrinos have different energies depending on where they're produced. For instance, the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, around 1.4 MeV, I think. The main pp chain produces lower-energy ones, maybe around 0.8 MeV or so. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos via the reaction 3H + 3H → 4He + 2p, which releases energy. The neutrinos emitted would be from the beta decays in this process. I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in a specific energy range. Let me think about their typical energies.

Wait, the neutrinos from the main pp chain (like the dominant branch) are around 0.8 MeV, which is 800 keV. So if the pp-III branch is responsible for a lot of the neutrinos in that region, stopping it would reduce the flux in that band. But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two bands. So band 1 is 700-800 keV and band 2 is 800-900 keV.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, the neutrinos from that process in the 800 keV region would drop. But what about the other sources? Or do other branches contribute to the same energy regions?

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch contributes more to the higher energy neutrinos, like in the 800-900 keV range, whereas the lower energies are from another branch. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the energy distribution of the neutrinos. The dominant neutrinos from the Sun are from the pp chain. The main pp process produces neutrinos with energies around 0.8 MeV. So if the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos does that affect?

Wait, the pp chain has different stages. The pp-I branch is the main one where two protons fuse via a boron intermediate. The pp-III branch is less dominant but contributes to higher neutrino energies. So the neutrinos from pp-III are maybe higher energy than the main branch.

If that's the case, stopping the pp-III would reduce the flux in the higher energy bands. So let's say that the 800-900 keV band (band 2) has a lot of neutrinos from the pp-III. If that branch stops, then the flux in band 2 would drop. But band 1 (700-800) would be unaffected because it's from another process (like the main pp-I or other sources).

Wait, but the problem says that all other reactions remain as they were. So if the pp-III was producing neutrinos in band 2, and it's now stopped, then the flux in band 2 would drop, while band 1 remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in both bands. Or maybe only a part of band 2 is affected.

Wait, another approach: The total solar neutrino flux is measured by experiments like the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. They found that the total flux agrees with the predictions, but earlier experiments thought there was a deficit, the solar neutrino problem. The problem was solved when it was realized that neutrinos oscillate between flavors as they travel through space, but that's a separate note.

But for this problem, the focus is on the production of neutrinos in the Sun. The pp-III branch is one of the steps. Let me think about the reaction: 3H + 3H → 4He + 2p + 2 neutrinos? Or is it one neutrino per reaction?

Wait, the 3H (helium-3) fusions: each 3H decays into 3He + e+ + νe, but no, wait, the decay is 3H → 3He + e− + ν̄e. Wait, no, wait, the beta decay is 3H → 3He + e− + ν̄e. Wait, no, the neutrino is emitted as a ν_e or anti-ν_e?

Wait, protons (hydrogen-1) fuse into deuterons, then into helium-3 via the pp-I branch. The 3H (tritium) is formed, but wait, in the pp-III branch, two 3H nuclei (each is a helium-3 with two protons attached?) No, wait, the reaction is 3H + 3H → 4He + 2p + 2ν. Because each 3H decays via beta decay into 3He, and then when they combine, two neutrons are released as neutrinos? Or perhaps each 3H decay releases a neutrino. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused on the exact process, but I think each 3H → 3He + e− + ν̄e. So when two 3H's combine, each decay emits a neutrino, so two neutrinos are involved.

But the point is, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have energies around 1.4 MeV? Or maybe lower. Wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the main neutrino emission from the pp chain is around 0.8 MeV, and the pp-III contributes a little more around 0.8 MeV, perhaps peaking higher, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have higher energies than the main pp branch. So, for example, the main pp neutrinos are around 0.8 MeV, while the pp-III neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV. But then the question's bands are 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). So if the pp-III neutrinos are higher, say around 1.4 MeV, then they wouldn't be in either of these bands. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up. Let's double-check. The main neutrino emission from the Sun comes from the beta decays in the proton-proton chain. Specifically, the dominant process is the pp-I branch, which produces a helium-3 nucleus, which then combines with another helium-3 nucleus to form helium-4. Each of these steps involves beta decays, producing neutrinos.

In the main pp-I branch, the reaction is:

p + p → 2H (deuterium) + e+ + νe

Then, another proton adds to deuterium:

2H + p → 3H (tritium) + gamma

3H then undergoes beta decay:

3H → 3He + e− + ν̄e (this is where the neutrino comes in; the anti-neutrino is emitted)

Wait, but for the neutrinos, each 3H decay produces an anti-neutrino. So two 3H decays would produce two anti-neutrinos. But wait, the total neutrino emission in the pp chain per helium-4 nucleus would be two neutrinos (or anti-neutrinos) per 4He.

Wait, perhaps each helium-4 production releases two neutrinos. So the neutrino flux from the pp chain is about 2 per 4He.

But then, the energy of these neutrinos is around 0.8 MeV each. So the main pp chain emits neutrinos around 0.8 MeV.

Then, the pp-III branch is a different pathway. So in the pp-III branch, the steps are:

p + p → 2H + e+ + νe

Another p adds to 2H → 3H + gamma.

Then, 3H + 3H → 4He + 2p + 2ν (where ν's are emitted as anti-neutrinos? Or maybe each 3H decay emits a ν, so two in total.)

Wait, if the two 3H's each decay into 3He, each emits an anti-neutrino, so two per 4He.

But perhaps the pp-III branch emits higher-energy neutrinos. Let me think: the energy of the neutrinos depends on the Q value of the decay. The beta decay of 3H (tritium) has a Q value of about 16.6 keV. Wait, that can't be right because the neutrinos would have energies much lower than that, but wait, no, that's the energy available. Wait, no, the Q value is the total energy available, which is around 16.6 keV. But when the neutrino is emitted, it takes away some of that energy. So the average energy of the neutrino from 3H decay is about 5.5 keV, but that's way lower than the 0.8 MeV I thought earlier. This seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the neutrinos from different sources. The main pp neutrinos are from the 8B (boron-8) decay in the CNO cycle, which emits a neutrino of about 15.5 MeV. But no, wait, the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp chain. Oh wait, no, the CNO neutrinos are lower than that. Let me get this straight.

Oh, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me see:

1. The main source of solar neutrinos is the pp chain, which produces neutrinos around 0.8 MeV (or lower, maybe up to 0.4 MeV or so). But I'm not entirely certain.

2. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, around a few MeV. But I think the CNO neutrinos are in a higher energy range than the pp chain.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the neutrino energies. Boron-8 (8B) is a radioactive isotope produced in the CNO cycle, and it decays via beta-plus decay into 8Be, emitting a positron and a neutrino. The Q value of this decay is about 15.5 MeV, so the neutrino energy is about 15.5 MeV minus the kinetic energy of the positron and the binding energy, but on average, the neutrinos from 8B decay are about 3-4 MeV. So they're in a much higher energy range than the pp chain neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch is stopped, which neutrinos are affected? The pp-III branch's neutrinos are from the beta decays in that process. So they would be lower energy than the CNO neutrinos but perhaps higher than the main pp branch.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the main pp chain neutrinos are around 0.8 MeV. So if the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, say around 1.4 MeV, then the neutrinos from that branch would be in the higher end of the Sun's neutrino spectrum.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos in the 1.4 MeV range would stop, but the main pp neutrinos (around 0.8 MeV) would continue.

But the question is about the bands 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). So if the pp-III neutrinos are in a higher energy range, say 1.4 MeV, then stopping the pp-III would have no impact on these bands. So the flux in bands 1 and 2 would remain the same as before, so the ratio would be 1.

But that can't be right because the problem states that the pp-III branch stopped, so something must change.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are at lower energies than I thought. Let me think again. The 3H (tritium) beta decay has a Q value of about 16.6 keV, so the emitted neutrinos would have energies up to about that, but that's way below 0.8 MeV. So the main pp neutrinos are from other sources.

Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos from the pp chain's main branch are in the 0.8 MeV range, and the pp-III branch contributes neutrinos in the same range but perhaps a little higher, maybe. So stopping the pp-III would reduce the flux in the higher part of the 0.8 MeV band.

Wait, the main pp chain produces neutrinos around 0.8 MeV, and the pp-III branch produces a smaller number of neutrinos but with higher energies, like 1.4 MeV. So in the 0.8 MeV band (700-800 and 800-900 keV), the main contribution is from the main pp branch. So if the pp-III stops, the main pp continues, so the flux in both bands would remain about the same. So the ratio would be 1. So the answer would be C) 1.

But wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped, so the neutrinos from that branch would no longer be present. If the main pp branch's neutrinos are in the 0.8 MeV range, and the pp-III's are in higher energies, then the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would be lower if the pp-III was a major contributor there.

Wait, if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV range, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2. So if the main pp branch contributes to band 1 and band 2, but the pp-
