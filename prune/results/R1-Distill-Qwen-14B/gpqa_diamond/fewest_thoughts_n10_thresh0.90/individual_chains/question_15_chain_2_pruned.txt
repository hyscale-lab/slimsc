Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the question says they have the same masses. Interesting. So mass-wise, they're equal. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3.

Both have circular orbits. That probably simplifies things because eccentricity isn't a factor here. 

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, why would that be? Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something, which can have similar radius but higher mass? I'm not too sure, but the key point is same radius for both stars.

The main question is which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So, transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But how do other factors like orbital size, star size, etc., come into play?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit to the size of the star, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think again. Oh right, the transit probability (assuming random orientation) is approximately (R*/a)^2, but wait, no, maybe it's (R* + R_p)/a, but I'm not confident. Wait, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet)Â², or maybe it's (R_star / a_planet) times something else.

Wait, another thought: the transit probability is given by the ratio of the size of the star's disk as seen from Earth compared to the planet's orbital distance. So, the probability is roughly equal to (R_star / a_planet) times (something else?), but I'm not quite
