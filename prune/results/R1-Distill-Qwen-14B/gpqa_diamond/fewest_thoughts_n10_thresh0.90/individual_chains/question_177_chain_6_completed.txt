--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Alright, let me read the details again.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They want to know by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming black body radiation.

Wait, okay, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? Where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But then there's the Doppler shift to consider because of their velocities. Because if a star is moving towards us, its emitted light is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted. But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe that affects their temperatures as observed?

Wait, but the problem says the star's wavelengths are the same. So when we observe the star, the peak wavelength (like from their black body spectrum) is the same. But the actual temperature of each star could be different because of their velocities. Because if the star is moving towards us, its emitted light is blueshifted, making it appear hotter. Or if moving away, redshifted, so cooler.

Hmm, but wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, the observed peak wavelength is the same. So for each star, the observed maximum emission is at the same wavelength. But their actual temperatures might differ because of their radial velocities.

So I think I need to relate the actual temperature of each star to the observed temperature, considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, let me think about the Doppler effect. The Doppler shift formula for light is given by λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the relativistic Doppler shift formula for transverse motion is different, but here we're talking about radial velocity, so it's a longitudinal Doppler shift.

Wait, the formula is λ_obs = λ_em * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. If the source is moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ). Hmm, but for velocities much smaller than the speed of light, the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_em * (1 + v/c), for v positive when moving away.

Wait, but the problem involves the peak emission wavelength. The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So, if the observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars, then λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ. But let’s think about each star’s actual temperature.

So for Star_1, its actual temperature is T1, but due to its velocity, the observed temperature would be different. Wait, but Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift for it. So T_observed for Star_1 is the same as its actual temperature, T1.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the peak wavelength observed is the same for both stars. So for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ2_obs. Let me denote λ1_obs as λ1 and λ2_obs as λ2, but they are equal. So λ1 = λ2.

But because Star_1 has v_r =0, its observed λ is the same as the emitted λ. So for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_em. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_em*(1 + v_r2/c), but wait, wait, no. Because the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive if moving away.

Wait, but the star's own temperature would relate to its emitted wavelength. So the star emits peak wavelength λ_em = b / T. But because of its velocity, we observe λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v_r / c).

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that the observed wavelengths are the same. So for both stars, the observed λ is the same. So let's say λ_obs = λ.

For Star_1: v_r1 = 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_em1. So λ_em1 = λ_obs = λ.

For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. So λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c). But λ_obs2 = λ_obs1 because they are the same. So, λ = λ_em2 * (1 + 700e3 / c), where c is speed of light.

Wait, but let me compute the Doppler factor. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is about 0.002333... times the speed of light, so v/c ≈ 0.002333.

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333.

So λ_em2 = λ / (1.002333) ≈ λ * 0.997676.

So the emitted wavelength of Star_2 is a bit shorter than the observed λ. Which means that Star_2's actual temperature is higher than what we observe because λ is inversely proportional to T.

So, let’s compute the temperatures.

Wien’s law: λ_max = b / T.

So for Star_1: λ_em1 = b / T1 → T1 = b / λ_em1.

But λ_em1 = λ_obs = λ.

So T1 = b / λ.

Wait, no, because for Star_1, λ_obs is the same as λ_em. So T1 is b / λ.

For Star_2: λ_em2 = b / T2.

But λ_obs = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) → λ = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

So T2 = (b / λ) * (1 + v_r2 / c) / (λ_obs) → Wait, no. Let me rearrange.

Wait, from Star_2:

λ_obs = λ_em2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But λ_em2 = b / T2.

So λ_obs = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Rearranged, T2 = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Since λ_obs is the same as λ_em1 for Star_1, which is λ = b / T1.

So substituting λ_obs = b/T1 into the equation for T2:

T2 = (b / (b/T1)) ) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, that's (T1) * (1 + v_r2/c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute 700e3 m/s divided by c (3e8 m/s).

700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

Wait, wait, 700,000 m/s divided by 300,000,000 m/s is 700e3/(3e8) = 7e5/(3e8) = 7/(300) = 0.02333...

So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.023333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by a factor of about 1.023333.

So now, the luminosity L is given by L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So for each star, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

We need to find L1/L2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2.

So R1 = 1.5 R2 → R2 = R1 / 1.5.

Wait, but T2 is T1 * 1.02333.

So let me substitute:

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T1^4.

Wait, wait, no, perhaps it's better to express L1 in terms of R2 and T1, but let's see.

Wait, R1 = 1.5 R2, so R2 = R1 / 1.5 = (2/3) R1.

So R1 = 1.5 R2 → R2 = (2/3) R1.

So substituting into L1 and L2:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

But R2 is (2/3) R1, and T2 is 1.02333 T1.

So substituting R2 and T2:

L2 = 4π ( (2/3 R1) )^2 σ (1.02333 T1)^4.

Compute L1/L2:

L1/L2 = [4π R1² σ T1^4 ] / [4π ( (2/3 R1)^2 σ (1.02333 T1)^4 ) ]

Simplify the terms:

4π cancels, σ cancels.

R1^2 / ( (2/3 R1)^2 ) = [ R1^2 ] / [ (4/9) R1^2 ) ] = 1 / (4/9) )= 9/4 = 2.25.

Similarly, T1^4 / (1.02333 T1)^4 = 1 / (1.02333)^4.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.02333)^4.

Compute (1.02333)^4:

Let me calculate 1.02333^2 first.

1.02333 * 1.02333 ≈ 1.0475 (since 0.02333^2 is about 0.000544, and 2*0.02333 ~0.04666, so 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.0472).

So (1.02333)^2 ≈ 1.0472.

Then square that for (1.02333)^4: 1.0472^2.

1.0472 * 1.0472: Let's compute.

1.0472 * 1.0472:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.0472 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 1 = 0.0472.

0.0472 * 0.0472 ≈ 0.00222784.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 1.0472^2:

= (1 + 0.0472)^2 = 1^2 + 2 *1 *0.0472 + 0.0472^2 = 1 + 0.0944 + 0.00222784 ≈ 1.09662784.

So (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.0966.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ Let me compute that.

2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ let's see.

1.0966 * 2 = 2.1932, which is just a bit less than 2.25.

So 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 1.0966 * 2.05 ≈ 2.222.

But 2.25 is the numerator, so 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ 2.25 * (1/1.0966) ≈ 2.25 * 0.912 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, but wait, that would make the luminosity ratio about 2.05, but the options given are around 2.23, 2.25, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the (1.02333)^4 more accurately.

Alternative approach: compute ln(1.02333) then multiply by 4, then exponentiate.

ln(1.02333) ≈ 0.023, assuming small x, ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x^3/3... so perhaps ≈ 0.023.

But 0.02333 is about 2.333e-2.

Let me compute more accurately. Using a calculator approach.

Wait, but perhaps let me use a better approximation.

1.02333^4:

Let me compute each step.

1.02333^1 = 1.02333.

1.02333^2 = (1.02333)^2.

Calculating:

1.02333 * 1.02333.

= 1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.02333 = 0.02333.

0.02333 * 1 = 0.02333.

0.02333 * 0.02333 ≈ 0.000544.

Adding all terms:

1 + 0.02333 + 0.02333 + 0.000544 = 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.0472.

So okay, that was correct.

Then 1.0472^2 = ?

Compute 1.0472 * 1.0472.

Let me do it digit by digit.

1.0472 * 1.0472:

Break it down:

1.0472 * 1 = 1.0472.

1.0472 * 0.04 = 0.041888.

1.0472 * 0.007 = 0.0073304.

1.0472 * 0.0002 = 0.00020944.

Wait, wait, maybe better to compute 1.0472 * 1.0472.

Multiply 10472 * 10472, then adjust decimal points.

But perhaps a better approach is:

(1 + 0.0472)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0472 + (0.0472)^2.

0.0472 squared is 0.00222784.

So 1 + 0.0944 + 0.00222784 ≈ 1.09662784.

Yes, so 1.09662784.

Thus, (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.0966.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) / 1.0966 ≈ let's compute 2.25 ÷ 1.0966.

Let me do this division.

1.0966 * 2 = 2.1932.

That's less than 2.25. The difference is 2.25 - 2.1932 = 0.0568.

So 0.0568 / 1.0966 ≈ 0.0518.

So total is approximately 2.0518.

Wait, but 2.0518 is about 2.05, which is close to option D which is ~2.23. Hmm, but wait, none of the options are around 2.05. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Doppler shift formula. Let me think again.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away (v positive) is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

Wait, but in our case, Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer than the emitted.

So λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

But in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So λ_obs for Star_2 is λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c ) = λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

Because Star_1 has v_r1=0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

So λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c ) = λ_rest1.

So λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Which means, the emitted wavelength of Star_2 is shorter than Star_1's emitted wavelength. So using Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T.

So for Star_1: λ_rest1 = b / T1 → T1 = b / λ_rest1.

For Star_2: λ_rest2 = b / T2 → T2 = b / λ_rest2.

But λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / (1 + v_r2/c ), so:

T2 = b / (λ_rest1 / (1 + v_r2/c )) ) = (b / λ_rest1) * (1 + v_r2/c )

But T1 = b / λ_rest1.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

That's correct. So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which, as before, with v_r2=700e3 m/s, gives T2 ≈ T1 * 1.02333.

So that part was correct.

Then, luminosity L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 =4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

The ratio L1/L2 is [R1² T1^4] / [ R2^2 T2^4 ]

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2 → R2 = R1 / 1.5.

So R2^2 = R1² / (1.5)^2 = R1² / 2.25.

T2 = T1 * 1.02333 → T2^4 = T1^4 * (1.02333)^4.

So substituting into L2:

L2 = 4π (R1² / 2.25) σ (T1^4 * (1.02333)^4 )

So L1/L2 = [ R1² T1^4 ] / [ (R1² / 2.25) * T1^4 * (1.02333)^4 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ R1² T1^4 ] / [ (R1² / 2.25) * T1^4 * (1.02333)^4 ) ]

The R1² and T1^4 terms cancel out.

So L1/L2 = 1 / [ (1/2.25) * (1.02333)^4 ) ]

= 2.25 / (1.02333)^4.

We already calculated (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.0966.

So 2.25 / 1.0966 ≈ let me compute that with more precision.

Let me calculate 2.25 ÷ 1.0966.

Hmm, 1.0966 * 2 = 2.1932.

2.1932 is less than 2.25 by 0.0568.

So how much more beyond 2 do we need?

0.0568 / 1.0966 ≈ 0.0518.

So total is approx 2.0518.

So about 2.05.

But the options don't have 2.05. The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, so none of the options match. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift.

Wait, another approach: when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the observed temperature is lower. But in our case, the observed peak wavelength is the same, so Star_2 must have a higher actual temperature than Star_1.

Wait, another way: given that λ_obs is same, but Star_2 is moving away, so its emitted λ is shorter (because λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c)), thus, T_emit for Star_2 is higher.

Wait, but let's re-express the temperatures again.

For Star_1:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 → λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b/λ_obs.

For Star_2:

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c ) → since λ_obs2 = λ_obs, λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v_r2/c )

So T2 = b / λ_emit2 → T2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v_r2/c )) ) = (b / λ_obs) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which is T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which brings us back to the same place.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of (1 + v_r2/c )^4.

Wait, v_r2 is 700 km/s.

c is 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 0.00233333333.

So 1 + v_r2/c = 1.0023333333.

So (1.0023333333)^4.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute (1.0023333333)^2.

1.0023333333 * 1.0023333333.

= 1 + 2*0.0023333333 + (0.0023333333)^2.

= 1 + 0.0046666666 + 0.0000054444.

≈ 1.004672111.

Then square that to get (1.0023333333)^4.

(1.004672111)^2.

= 1 + 2*0.004672111 + (0.004672111)^2.

= 1 + 0.009344222 + 0.000021828.

≈ 1.00936605.

So (1.0023333333)^4 ≈ 1.009366.

Wait, that's different from the previous calculation. So earlier I thought (1.02333)^4 was about 1.0966, but that was incorrect because I used 1.02333 instead of 1.002333.

Ah! I think I made a mistake earlier by using 1.02333 instead of 1.002333. That changes things.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ approximately 1.009366.

So going back, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.25 ÷ 1.009366.

Compute that: let's approximate.

1.009366 * 2.23 = ?

Well, 1.009366 * 2.23 → 2.23 *1 is 2.23, 2.23 *0.009366≈ 0.02087.

So total ≈ 2.25087.

Wait, that's very close to 2.25.

Wait, so 2.25 ÷ 1.009366 ≈ 2.23.

Because 1.009366 * 2.23 ≈ 2.25.

So the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.23.

So the correct answer is option D, ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The problem provides the following information:

1. **Radius**: \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\).
2. **Radial Velocities**: \(v_{r1} = 0\) (Star_1 is stationary), \(v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) (Star_2 is moving away).
3. **Observed Peak Wavelengths**: Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\).

### Step 1: Relating Observed and Emitted Wavelengths
The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
\]

For Star_1 (\(v_{r1} = 0\)), the observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}}.
\]

For Star_2 (\(v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)), the emitted wavelength is shorter due to the Doppler shift:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + v_{r2}/c}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law
Wien's law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:  
\[
\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T},
\]
where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant. Using this, the temperatures of the two stars are related as:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_{r2}}{c}\right).
\]

Substituting \(v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\):  
\[
\frac{v_{r2}}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333, \quad \text{so} \quad T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333.
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
\]

Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333\):  
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 (T_1 \cdot 1.002333)^4}.
\]

Simplify the terms:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{1.5^2}{(1.002333)^4}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the Ratio
1. Compute \(1.5^2 = 2.25\).
2. Compute \((1.002333)^4\):  
   Using the approximation \((1 + x)^4 \approx 1 + 4x\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.002333\):  
   \[
   (1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4 \cdot 0.002333 = 1.009332.
   \]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009332} \approx 2.23.
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.

**Answer: D**
