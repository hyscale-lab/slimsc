Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The question is about how this setup would mimic the presence of an exoplanet in terms of brightness variations. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as these spots do.

Wait, right. When a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. But in this case, the star has spots, and when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing variations in the observed brightness. So the problem is essentially comparing the light variation caused by a planet to that caused by these spots.

The question says that the star isn't actually covered by spots, but we're to imagine a scenario where the same brightness variation would be caused by a planet. So we need to make the planet's effect (the dip in brightness) equal in amplitude to the effect of the spots. 

Let me think about how each of these scenarios affects the brightness.

First, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere, so each spot is on one half. Wait, the filling factor is 20%, which is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere, which is a spherical cap, has 20% of its area covered by spots.

Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So if the star's surface area is 4πR², then each hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so the area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, since it's only one hemisphere, the total spotted area is 0.4πR².

But when the star rotates, only part of the spotted hemisphere is visible. Wait, no, the question says only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star
