Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on it. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots are at 5000K, I guess.

The question is about photometric observations. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, the brightness changes periodically as the star spins. The interesting part is that this can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So, they're asking, if the same amplitude in the light curve is observed, what would be the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius?

Hmm. So, to find Rpl/Rstar, where Rpl is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

First, I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots (star's own variation) to the variation caused by a planet transiting.

When a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness is proportional to the area blocked. So the amplitude is (Area of planet / Area of star) = (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2). So that's for the transit method.

But the spots cause a dip in brightness because when the spots are facing us, the star looks a bit dimmer. The amount of dip depends on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the rest of the star.

Wait, but how do I calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots? I remember that the flux from a star with spots depends on the spot coverage and their temperatures.

Let me think. The star's total flux is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area. Each part emits according to their own temperature. The flux from a blackbody is proportional to T^4. So, the total flux when the spots are visible would be lower than when they're not.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, but the hemisphere is the entire visible side from our point of view. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, the hemisphere area is 2πR², so the spotted area would be 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². But when the star rotates, the spot coverage varies. Wait, but the problem states that it's one hemisphere that's covered, so the maximum coverage would be when the entire hemisphere is visible. So when the star is not rotating in a way that brings the spots into view, the spots are on the far side. The brightness variation would be maximum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and minimum when the unspotted side is.

Wait, no. Because the star
