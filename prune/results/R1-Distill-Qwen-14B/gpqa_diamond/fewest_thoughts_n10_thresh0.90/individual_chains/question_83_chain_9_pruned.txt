Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka is 1.85x10^-5.

Wait, okay, first, when we dilute the acetic acid with water, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, so the total volume is 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution would be half, I think. Because concentration is moles over volume. So original moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³, volume is 0.04 L, so new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH needed: same, 0.001. The volume of NaOH required would be 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH used. So at that point, we've neutralized a quarter of the acetic acid.

Wait, let's think. So for the 25% titration point, a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So initially, we have 0.001 moles CH3COOH. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have reacted, forming 0.00025 moles of acetate.

So the remaining moles of CH3COOH would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And acetate is 0.00025 moles. But wait, the total volume at 25% titration is initial solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, to find the pH at this point, I think the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Wait, 1.85e-5 is about 2e-5, so pKa is around 4.74? Wait, 1.85e-5 is the Ka. So pKa is approximately 4.73 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5 - 0.267=4.733). 

So using the Henderson equation, pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 is roughly 0.333. So log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Wait, but wait, 0.00025 / 0.0425 is 0.005882. And 0.00075 / 0.0425 is 0.017647. So 0.005882 / 0.017647 is 0.333. So yeah, ratio is 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = ~4.253, which is approximately 4.26.

So at 25% titration, pH is around 4.26.

Then, at equivalence point. Equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate comes from the moles of acetate divided by the total volume. Moles of acetate at equivalence are 0.001 moles, from the initial 0.001 moles of acetic acid. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH added, which is 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. It will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M, so we can set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x is very small.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. That's [OH^-], so pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I made a mistake here. Because when you have a solution of sodium acetate, the hydrolysis reaction produces OH-, making the solution basic. So the pH should be above 7.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Kb is 5.405e-10. So, setting up the equation:

Let [OH^-] = x.

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So pOH is about 4.98, pH is 9.02. So at equivalence point, pH is around 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have a pH of around 9 for the equivalence point. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → equivalence 8.52? No, that can't be right.

Option B: 3.17; 6.73 → nope.

Option C: 4.73; 7.00 → no, because equivalence is basic.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92 → no, also not matching.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Wait, when you add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, the initial moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Diluting to 40 cm³, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. So moles of acetate is 0.001. Total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) → 50 cm³. So [acetate] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hydrolysis reaction: acetate + H2O → acetic acid + OH^-.

Kb is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH is 9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the equivalence point calculation. Let me think: when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic region, so pH >7. The options only have D's equivalence point at 6.92, which is just below 7. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait,
