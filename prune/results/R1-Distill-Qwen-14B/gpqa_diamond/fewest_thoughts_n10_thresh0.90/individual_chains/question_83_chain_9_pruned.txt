Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I think I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

So, the initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. That means the final volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 = 40. The concentration after dilution will be half, I think. Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant. So the new concentration should be 0.025 M. Oh wait, because 0.05 M times 20 cm³ gives the moles, and then dividing by 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M. Yeah, that makes sense.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, we're adding a strong base to a weak acid. So the reaction will form acetate ions and water. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, first things first, what's the initial moles of acetic acid before titration? Let me calculate that. Moles = concentration (M) * volume (L). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) is 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M in 0.04 L, so moles are still 0.001. Right, because dilution doesn't change moles, just the concentration.

Now, the titration with NaOH: the volume needed to reach equivalence point. So moles of NaOH needed equals moles of acetic acid. Moles NaOH = 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

The question asks about two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. So at 25% of the equivalence volume, how much NaOH have I added?

25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So I've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, but wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and I'm adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So the total volume at 25% is 42.5 cm³.

Now, at 25% titration, what's the reaction? Acetic acid reacts with NaOH to form acetate. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So that's the moles of NaOH added.

Since acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, they react in a 1:1 ratio. So the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) will decrease by 0.00025, and the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) will increase by the same amount.

Initially, after dilution, we have 0.001 moles of CH3COOH and 0 L of NaOH added. So after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

So the solution at 25% titration is a buffer solution, a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733. Hmm, but wait, let me compute it accurately. 1.85 is between 1.78 (which is 10^-0.73) and 1.8 (10^-0.745). So log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so pKa is 4.733.

Wait, let me compute it with a calculator. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 10^-5. So log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672, so pKa is 4.7328, about 4.73.

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log (moles of A^- / moles of HA). But wait, the volumes are the same, so the ratio is just moles ratio.

Moles of A^- (acetate) is 0.00025, HA (acetic acid) is 0.00075. So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) which is about -0.477. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) = approximately 4.253. Hmm, that's about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

The ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771. So 4.733 - 0.4771 = 4.2559, which is approximately 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration. So the first number should be around 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH, forming acetate ions. So the solution will contain Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will dissociate completely, and acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

So the solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate will depend on the total volume.

At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 * 0.010 L = 0.001 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, all the acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate.

The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ (20+20) plus 10 cm³ NaOH added, which is 50 cm³ or 0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is a weak base. It will react with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M, so we can set up the equation for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] is approximately 3.288e-6 M.

Then, pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me calculate that. Log(3.288) is about 0.517, so log(3.288e-6) is 5.517. So pOH is ~5.517. Therefore, pH is 14 - 5.517 = 8.483. So approximately 8.48 at equivalence point.

Wait, but wait a second, I might have made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me double-check. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb is 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Alternatively, maybe using the approximation isn't valid. Let's see. Kb is 5.4e-10, and concentration is 0.02 M. The square root of Kb is sqrt(5.4e-10) = 7.35e-5. Since 7.35e-5 is much less than 0.02 (which is 2e-2), the approximation holds. So x is about 3.288e-6, as before.

So pH is about 8.48. But looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52. So the second value is 8.52. Hmm, our calculation is 8.48, but perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(1.081e-11) more accurately. 1.081e-11 is 1.081 x 10^-11. The square root is sqrt(1.081) * 1e-5.5. Sqrt(1.081) is about 1.04. So sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.5. Wait, 1e-5.5 is sqrt(1e-11), which is 3.16e-
