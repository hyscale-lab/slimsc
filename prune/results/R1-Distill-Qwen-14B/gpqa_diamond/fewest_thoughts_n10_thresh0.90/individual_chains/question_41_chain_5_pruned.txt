Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? We take the speed of light in a vacuum c as 1.

Hmm. The options are A to D. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially involving light, we have to consider special relativity, but maybe this is more of a classical mechanics problem. Wait, but the speed of light is a fundamental constant in any inertial frame. So according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But wait, this isn't a vacuum because it's glass. So the speed of light in glass is different.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where n is the refractive index. So in the glass, the speed is v_glass = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So we have to find the speed of the light beam in the lab frame.

Wait, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards us, and the light is moving in the same direction. So, the question is, from the lab's perspective, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, but hold on. If the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer (so, the lab is the observer's frame), and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Does that mean the light's speed in the lab frame is the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's speed in the glass? Or is it more complicated because of relativity?

Wait, in classical mechanics, velocities add up linearly, but in relativity, it's not that simple. However, since the speed of light in the glass is c/n, which is less than c, but when you add velocities, you have to consider whether to use Galilean addition or relativistic addition.

Wait, but in the problem, the speed of light in the glass is v_glass = c/n â‰ˆ (1/n) since c is 1. So the glass is moving at speed v. The light's velocity in the glass's frame is v_glass (which is 1/n, but it's moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, which is the observer's frame, the light's velocity would be v_glass + v, but wait, no, that's only if we're using Galilean transformations, which are only accurate at low speeds, i.e., when v is much less than c. But in reality, if the speeds are significant compared to c, we need to use the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So let me model this. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the lab is the observer's frame, and the glass is moving at v in the same direction as the light.

Wait, but the light is within the glass. So the speed of light in the glass is v_g = (c/n) in the glass's rest frame. So in the lab frame, which sees the glass moving, how do we find the speed of the light?

Wait, the problem is probably expecting a classical approach because it's a standard refraction scenario, but I might be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

So, let's think about this: the light's velocity in the glass's frame is v_g = c/n. Since the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, we can use the velocity addition formula from special
