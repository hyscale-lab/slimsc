Okay, so I have this physics problem about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, the glass has an index of refraction n. So normally, when the glass is stationary, the speed of light inside it is c/n, right? Because the refractive index n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So v_glass = c/n when it's at rest.

But in this case, the glass is moving. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. Oh, wait, same direction as the beam. So the light is moving, say, to the right, and the glass is also moving to the right but towards the observer. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me visualize the setup.

The lab is the observer's frame. The glass is moving in the direction the light is propagating. So, for example, if the light is going to the right, the glass is moving to the right as well. But wait, the problem says the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, if the light is moving toward the observer, then the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the light beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So if the beam is moving towards the observer, then the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Or is the glass moving in the same direction as the beam, which could be towards or away from the observer. Hmm, the wording says it's moving toward the observer. So the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer.

So, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light is also moving towards the observer through the glass. Wait, but the light's speed in the glass is c/n. But because the glass is moving, we need to consider the velocity addition from relativity.

Wait, wait. This is a problem about relative velocity. But when velocities are involved, we can't just add them directly because of relativity. But wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? So if this is in an inertial frame, the speed of light in the lab frame should be c. So maybe the answer
