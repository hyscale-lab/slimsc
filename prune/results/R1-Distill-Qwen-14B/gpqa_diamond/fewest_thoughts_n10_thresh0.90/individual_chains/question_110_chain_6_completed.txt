Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question is about the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The key point is that each has a different brightness limit for the stars they can observe. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can handle up to V mag 16. So, the stars need to be bright enough to be within both telescopes' capabilities.

Looking at the options, each star has different parameters, so I'll need to calculate their apparent V magnitudes to see which ones fit within both limits.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star 1: RA 15 deg, DEC -75, absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude is the brightness at 10 pc. Since it's already at 10 pc, the apparent mag should be the same as the absolute. So apparent V mag is 15.5. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see this, right? Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, and HIRES up to 16. So 15.5 is within both, so both can detect it.

Star 2: RA 30, DEC 55, apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. But wait, the apparent magnitude is already given. So it's 16.5. Then, for ESPRESSO, since the limit is 17, 16.5 is okay. But HIRES can only go up to 16, right? So 16.5 is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it. So Star2 can't be detected by HIRES. So it's only detectable by ESPRESSO. So in the options, if a star is only detectable by one, it's out unless both can see.

Star3: RA 11h, DEC 48, apparent V 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc. Wait, but E(B-V) is the color excess, which affects extinction. The total absorption (AV) is 3.1 * E(B-V). So AV = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the apparent V mag is affected. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. The apparent magnitude as given is after extinction? Or is that the intrinsic? Oh, wait, the question says Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5, but E(B-V) is 0.6. So, wait, that can't be right. Because the apparent magnitude already includes extinction. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, perhaps I need to calculate the extinction-corrected magnitude.

Wait, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Oh, right. So the apparent magnitude we observe is affected by extinction. So the observed mag (m) is the intrinsic mag (M) plus the extinction (A). Or wait, no. Wait, the formula is m = M + 5 +5 log d - A_V. Oh wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log (d/10) - A_V, I think. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) at 10 pc, so the formula is m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V. Wait, wait. Or is it m = M + 5 log(d) - 5 + A_V? I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, maybe Star3's apparent magnitude is the observed one, which includes extinction. So to find the intrinsic magnitude, you subtract the extinction. But for the purpose of determining if the star is bright enough, the apparent magnitude is what matters because that's what the telescope observes.

Wait, the question says Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So the extinction in V band is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 *0.6 = about 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, no, wait. No, extinction makes stars appear fainter. So if a star's light is extinguished, the observed m is higher (since fainter). So the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, but in this case, Star3's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5. So that's after extinction. Hmm, no, wait, because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the amount of reddening. So the observed V magnitude would be the intrinsic (what it would be without extinction) plus A_V. Therefore, if the apparent magnitude is 15.5, that's the observed m. So the intrinsic m would be m_observed - A_V =15.5 -1.86 = approx 13.64 mag.

Wait, but why do I need the intrinsic magnitude? Or do I? Because for the spectrograph, they observe the apparent magnitude. Because whether a star is bright enough for the instrument depends on its apparent magnitude as seen from Earth.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. For each star, what's the apparent V magnitude? That's what the spectrographs can detect.

So for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed value. Since HIRES can observe up to 16, and ESPRESSO up to 17, Star3 at 15.5 is within both. So both can detect Star3.

Wait, but wait, the star's distance is 15 pc. Star3's absolute magnitude is not given. Wait, no, Star3's absolute magnitude isn't given because the question provides apparent magnitude. So perhaps we don't need to calculate anything else for Star3, because the apparent magnitude is already given.

Wait, no. Wait the question says Star3 has an apparent V mag of 15.5 and E(B-V) of 0.6. So the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is after extinction. So in that case, the star's light is dimmed by extinction, making it appear fainter. But we're given the observed apparent magnitude, so the 15.5 is what the telescope would see. So that's acceptable for both spectrographs, since 15.5 is less than 16 and 17.

Wait, no. Because wait, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is brighter than both 16 and 17. So both can detect. So Star3 is visible to both.

Star4: RA 85 deg, DEC -48, absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc. So to find the apparent magnitude, we need to calculate the distance modulus and add the extinction.

First, distance modulus is 5 log (d/10) where d is in parsecs. d=10 pc, so log(10/10)= log(1)=0. So distance modulus is 0. So the apparent mag without extinction is M + 0 = 15.5. But we need to add the extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 *0.4=1.24 mag. So apparent mag is 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V. Because extinction makes the star appear fainter, which is higher m.

So Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So 5 log (10/10)=0. So m =15.5 + A_V. A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

But wait, the apparent magnitude is 16.74. So can HIRES observe it? HIRES can go up to 16 mag. 16.74 is higher (fainter) than 16, so HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is within its limit. So only ESPRESSO can detect Star4.

Star5: RA 10h, DEC 60 deg, absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. Compute apparent magnitude.

Distance modulus: 5 log (5/10) = 5 log (0.5) = 5*(-0.3010)≈-1.505. So m = M -1.505 + A_V. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_V. So d=5, so log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.301. So m=16.5 + (5 * (-0.301)) + A_V.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no extinction is given for Star5. So A_V is zero? Because E(B-V) isn't given, so no reddening. So m = M +5 log (d/10). So M=16.5, d=5.

5 log (5/10) = 5 * log(0.5) ≈5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505. So m=16.5 -1.505 =14.995, approximately 15.0.

So apparent magnitude is ~15.0, which is within both ESPRESSO's 17 and HIRES's 16. So both can detect Star5.

Wait, but let me double-check. The absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance is 5 pc. So distance modulus is 5*(log(5) -1) =5*(0.69897-1) =5*(-0.30103)= -1.505. So m = M + distance modulus =16.5 -1.505 =14.995, so about 15.0. So yes, apparent V is 15.0. So both spectrographs can see it.

Now, let's recap each star's apparent magnitude as observed:

Star1: 15.5. Both can detect.

Star2: 16.5. ESPRESSO can (17 limit), HIRES can't (16 limit). So only ESPRESSO.

Star3:15.5. Both can.

Star4:16.74. Only ESPRESSO.

Star5:15.0. Both can.

Now, the question asks which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. So which stars have apparent V mag <=16 (for HIRES) and <=17 (for ESPRESSO).

So Star1: 15.5: yes for both.

Star3:15.5: yes for both.

Star5:15.0: yes for both.

Star2:16.5: ESPRESSO yes, HIRES no.

Star4:16.74: ESPRESSO yes, HIRES no.

So which stars are detectable by both?

Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, none of the options say Star1, Star3, and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, wait, let me recheck each star's apparent V mag.

Star1: absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent mag is 15.5, since M is the same as apparent at 10 pc. So yes.

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5, so no for HIRES.

Star3: apparent mag 15.5, yes for both.

Star4: apparent mag 16.74, no for HIRES.

Star5: apparent mag 15.0, yes for both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. Option D is Star1 and Star4. So none have all three.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake with Star3's apparent magnitude. Because the question says that Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, but it's at 15 pc, and with E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, for Star3, the apparent V mag is given as 15.5. The E(B-V) is 0.6, but the apparent V is already observed (so already includes extinction). So the apparent magnitude is 15.5, so no need to adjust it. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is acceptable for both.

So the stars acceptable for both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But looking at the options, none have all three. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I calculate the apparent magnitudes for some stars.

Wait, let's double-check Star5.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc. So distance modulus 5 log(5/10) = 5 log(0.5) =5*(-0.301)= -1.505. So m = M + distance modulus =16.5 -1.505 =14.995 ≈15.0. So yes, apparent mag 15.0.

So in the options, the only stars that are detectable by both are Star3 and Star5 (option B), which would mean Star3 and Star5 are both visible to both telescopes.

Wait, but Star1 is also visible to both. So why isn't it in any option?

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation for Star5.

Wait, wait, Star5's absolute V mag is 16.5, which is higher than Star3's, but closer distance. So with 5 pc, the apparent mag is 15.0.

So which options have both Star3 and Star5? That's option B.

But wait, Star1 is also detectable by both. So why is it not an option? Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Star1. Star1's absolute magnitude is 15.5 and it's at 10 pc, so apparent mag is 15.5. But wait, do I need to account for the distance modulus? No, because 10 pc is the standard for absolute magnitude. So yes, Star1's apparent mag is 15.5.

So, Star1 can be detected by both, Star3 can be, and Star5 can be.

But none of the options include all three. So perhaps the question is only about which stars are detectable by both, and the options might have one pair, but perhaps I have to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about which observatories can see the stars, not just the brightness.

Wait, the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitude, so it's only about the magnitude.

Wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both.

So the correct answer would include all stars that have apparent mag <=16 (for HIRES) and <=17 (for ESPRESSO). So the stars are:

Star1:15.5 → yes

Star2:16.5 → HIRES no

Star3:15.5 → yes

Star4:16.74 → HIRES no

Star5:15.0 → yes.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But looking at the options, none include all three. So perhaps the question is only considering pairs, and the correct option is B) Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but why is that? Because Star1 is also detectable by both.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the apparent magnitude of Star1. Let me check again.

Star1: absolute V mag is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So the apparent mag is the same as absolute, 15.5.

So yes, both can detect it. So the correct answer should include Star1, but none of the options have that except option D, which pairs Star1 and Star4.

But Star4's apparent mag is 16.74, which is beyond HIRES's limit. So option D can't be right.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star3. Because Star3 has E(B-V) =0.6, which adds extinction. So perhaps the observed apparent mag is higher than the given value.

Wait, wait, wait, no. Because Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, which already includes the extinction. Because if you have E(B-V), you can calculate the extinction in V. So the formula is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 1.86. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V =15.5 - 1.86=13.64. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, no. Because when you have extinction, the observed magnitude is m = m_intrinsic + A_V. Because extinction makes the star appear fainter, so higher magnitude.

So if the observed m is 15.5, and A_V is 1.86, then the intrinsic m (without extinction) would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, no, because the star's light is being absorbed, making it appear dimmer (higher m). The observed m is 15.5, which is after extinction. So if the star's true brightness is 13.64, but when observed through the dust, it appears as 15.5.

But when considering if the spectrograph can detect it, the observed m is what matters. So the apparent mag is 15.5. So both can detect it.

Wait, but I'm now confused. Let me think again.

When a star is observed, the apparent magnitude is what the telescope sees, which includes any extinction. So the observed m is 15.5 for Star3, which is the correct value to consider. So Star3 is visible to both.

So the stars that both can detect are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But the options don't have any option with all three. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering Star5.

Wait, Star5's apparent magnitude is about 15.0, which is within both.

So, the correct pair must include either Star3 and Star5, which is option B, or Star1 and Star5, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. But why isn't Star1 included?

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the absolute vs apparent magnitude for Star1.

Wait, Star1's absolute magnitude is 15.5, and it's at 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude is the same as absolute, 15.5. So yes, both can see it. So why isn't Star1 included in any of the options? Because none of the options have Star1 in them except option D, which includes Star4, which isn't detectable by both.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is that both Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps Star5's observed magnitude is 15.0, so both can detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But the options are limited to pairs, so perhaps the correct answer is option B, which includes Star3 and Star5.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me check Star5 again.

Wait, Star5: absolute V mag is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So distance modulus is 5 log (5/10) = 5 * log(0.5) = ~-1.505. So m = M + distance modulus =16.5 -1.505=15.0.

So yes, apparent mag is 15.0, which is acceptable for both.

So Star5 is visible to both.

So looking back at the options, the only pair that includes two stars visible to both is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but Star1 is also visible to both. So why isn't it an option? Because the options don't include a trio, and perhaps I made a mistake in considering Star1's parameters.

Wait, maybe Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but perhaps I need to account for the fact that the observatories have different locations, which affects whether the star is visible.

The question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitudes, so it's only about magnitude. So perhaps Star1 is visible to both.

But the options don't have an option with Star1, Star3, and Star5. So perhaps the intended answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with Star5. Let me recheck Star5.

Star5's absolute mag is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m = M + 5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 + (-1.505) =14.995, ~15.0. So yes, both can detect.

So the correct answer should be the stars that have apparent V mag <=16 and <=17.

Thus, the stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5. But since the options don't include all three, perhaps the intended correct answer is option B (Star3 and Star5) and option D (Star1 and Star4) is incorrect because Star4 is only detected by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but Star1 is in none of the options except option D, which pairs it with Star4, which can't be detected by both.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star3's apparent magnitude.

Wait, Star3's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, which is already observed, so it's correct. So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But since the options don't have all three, the correct answer is the pair that includes both. So option B includes Star3 and Star5, which are both detected by both.

So the answer must be option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we need to compare the apparent V magnitudes of the stars with the brightness limits of the two instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can observe stars up to 16. Stars must have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: 15.5  
   - Distance: 10 pc  
   - Apparent V magnitude: Since the absolute magnitude is defined at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is the same as the absolute magnitude, i.e., 15.5.  
   - Both ESPRESSO (17 limit) and HIRES (16 limit) can detect this star.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: 16.5  
   - HIRES can only observe stars up to 16, so it cannot detect this star. ESPRESSO (17 limit) can detect it.  
   - This star is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: 15.5  
   - E(B-V) = 0.6, so extinction in the V band is \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - The apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction, so the observed magnitude is 15.5.  
   - Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect this star.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: 15.5  
   - Distance: 10 pc  
   - Distance modulus: \( 5 \log(10/10) = 0 \), so apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5.  
   - E(B-V) = 0.4, so extinction in the V band is \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Apparent magnitude with extinction: \( 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - HIRES (16 limit) cannot detect this star, but ESPRESSO (17 limit) can.  
   - This star is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: 16.5  
   - Distance: 5 pc  
   - Distance modulus: \( 5 \log(5/10) = 5 \log(0.5) \approx -1.505 \).  
   - Apparent magnitude: \( 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
   - Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect this star.

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1 (15.5)**, **Star3 (15.5)**, and **Star5 (15.0)**. However, the options provided only include pairs of stars. Among the options, **Star3 and Star5** (Option B) are the correct pair, as both are detectable by both instruments.

Answer: B
