Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the migration of a pi bond within a sigma framework, right? The question provides three different reactions, and I need to figure out the products each one forms. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for A, B, and C.

Let me start by looking at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure must be (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Oh wait, no. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2-NH2? Or maybe it's (CH3O)2CHCH2NH2? No, wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. 1,1-dimethoxy would mean both oxygens are on the same carbon as the amine? So it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or maybe it's more like (HOCH2CH2NH2) with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

But wait, the other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. That's CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, but more accurately, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no, I think but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH2-OH? No, wait, but numbering... Let's see, but-3-en-2-ol. So position 2 is the OH. Structure would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, no, wait, but 3-en is double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but
