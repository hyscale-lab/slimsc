Okay, I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let me see what I can remember and how to approach each step.

So, the first part is about 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, a dehydrohalogenation occurs, leading to the formation of an alkene via an E2 mechanism. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with excess KOH would likely eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds) or perhaps a single double bond if elimination is possible.

Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions would be such that elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, but wait, because in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are on opposite positions, maybe leading to a transannular elimination, forming a bridge or a more complex structure.

Wait, no, actually, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a base like KOH, it probably undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form 1,3-adamantadiene. But wait, that's a conjugated diene, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a single double bond. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's forming a single double bond because the two Brs are on adjacent positions in the adamantane structure. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So elimination of two HBr molecules would require the loss of two Hs from adjacent carbons to form a double bond, but wait, if the Brs are on non-adjacent carbons, can they both eliminate?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. In a molecule, for elimination to form a double bond, you need two adjacent halogen atoms. Because E2 mechanism requires the leaving groups (Br-) to be antiperiplanar and the H to be abstracted from the adjacent carbon. So if the two Br
