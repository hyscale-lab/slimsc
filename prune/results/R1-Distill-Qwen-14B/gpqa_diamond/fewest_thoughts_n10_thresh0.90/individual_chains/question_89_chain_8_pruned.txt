Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to walk through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with an excess of KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone. The ¹H NMR spectrum has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). 

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative. When you have two bromines on adjacent positions, heating with a strong base like KOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction. But wait, if it's a dihalide, perhaps it's undergoing a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. So, could it form a ketone? Or maybe an elimination to form an alkene, but that doesn't fit the IR peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction? Wait, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution. Hmm.

Wait, wait, another thought: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in a case where the two leaving groups are on adjacent carbons, it's more likely an elimination to form a double bond. But the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent X) are treated with a base, they can undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkyne. But that would give a carbon-carbon triple bond. But an alkyne's IR peak is around 2220 cm⁻¹, which isn't matching here. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the bromides are replaced by something else. But wait, the product is a solid, and the IR has a carbonyl. Another possibility: the base could cause the formation of an epoxide, but that's usually with peracids or other conditions. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a ketone via some rearrangement. Oh! Maybe it's an example of the pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement occurs when a 1,2-diol is treated with acid, leading to a carbonyl. But wait, in this case, we have a dihalide. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a cyclopropane? No, that's usually for geminal dihalides. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not geminal, so elimination would form a double bond, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait a minute, perhaps the base is causing a ring-opening of the adamantane structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, quite stable, but perhaps under strong basic conditions, it can undergo some ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm region is usually for something like an oxygen-bearing CH2, maybe an ether or an alcohol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: the product is an epoxide. No, because an epoxide's protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm as a triplet or something else, but more importantly, the IR for epoxides show a peak around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here. So probably not.

Wait, if it's a ketone, then the carbonyl is at 1720 cm⁻¹. Then where are the protons? The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or alcohol. But why would the reaction produce a ketone and something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that's for coupling two aryl halides, which doesn't fit here.

Wait, considering that the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a neighboring group participation. For example, in some bicyclic compounds, elimination can lead to a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond and a carbonyl in a cyclic transition state.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl via some rearrangement. But I'm not exactly sure about the mechanism here.

Wait, perhaps the product is an adamantyl group with a ketone substituent. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. If the starting compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH could lead to a diketone? Or perhaps a single ketone.

Wait, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol, which upon heating could undergo a cyclization. But that's just speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the KOH is not just a base but also a deprotonating agent. Maybe it's an E2 elimination where two H's are abstracted, leading to a double bond, but again, I'm not seeing how that would form a ketone.

Wait, another angle: looking at the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H, which makes me think of maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 ppm is a multiplet for 10H, which suggests a lot of equivalent protons in a ring structure, perhaps the adamantane part. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps connected to the carbonyl.

So perhaps product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone and an ethyl group attached. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where both Br atoms are replaced by hydroxide groups, but that would form a diol. But then the IR would show O-H stretches, which are usually broad. The IR given doesn't mention that, so maybe it's not a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the base isn't substituting but causing some kind of elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of an epoxide, but as I thought earlier, that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond, but if each Br is on a different position, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl. But that would require two eliminations, which might not be feasible.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an adamantanone, where one of the bridgehead carbons has a ketone group. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent bridgeheads. Eliminating both Br atoms might form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but elimination typically forms a double bond, not a carbonyl. Unless it's a conjugated diene or some other structure. I'm getting stuck here.

Maybe I should move on to the next step and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone, as per the IR. So heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might be a Friedel-Crafts acylation? Or perhaps it's a Grignard reagent formation, but I don't think so because Grignard reagents are usually formed from alkyl halides with Mg.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide might cause some kind of aldol condensation or another type of carbonyl reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen or Dieckmann condensation, but those usually require esters.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkyne, but the IR doesn't support that. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but again, I don't think so.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an enol ether. Enol ethers can undergo various reactions, but I'm not sure how Al isopropoxide would react with that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a result of a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but I'm not sure what the substrate would be. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps in product 2 it's being used to form an acylium ion, which would then react with something else. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the Al isopropoxide is causing it to form an ether via acid-catalyzed dehydration. But then product 2 would be an alkene, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to think differently.

Product 1's NMR: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

The 10H in that region suggests perhaps a bicyclic structure, maybe a bridge. The 2H at 1.94 could be a CH2 group attached to something, like a carbonyl.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Singlet implies no neighboring protons. So maybe it's a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like O or N. But the IR is 1720, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps it's an acetate group or something similar.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone and an ester group? But that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a secondary alcohol, but then the IR would have an OH peak, which isn't mentioned.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. So the NMR shows a singlet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 connected to the carbonyl. For example, (CH2)CO.

So perhaps the structure is something like CH2-CO-adamantane. Then the 4.79 ppm would be the CH2 next to the carbonyl. The 1.94 ppm would be another CH2 group, maybe part of the adamantane structure.

So, for product 1, the structure might be 1-adamantyl methyl ketone. So, the molecule would have a carbonyl group attached to a CH2, which is connected to the adamantane ring.

Now, moving to the next step: product 1 is heated with excess Al(i-Pr)3, forming product 2. So, Al(i-Pr)3 is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But for Friedel-Crafts, we need an aromatic ring and an acyl chloride or similar. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation.

Wait, but product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave double bonds, breaking alkenes into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must contain a double bond because ozonolysis is used on alkenes.

Hmm. So product 2 must have a double bond, so product 1 must have undergone some reaction that forms a double bond. Wait, earlier I thought product 1 was a ketone. So how does product 2 get a double bond?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination. But product 1's IR doesn't show O-H stretch, so maybe it's not an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bromide, but no, the reaction with KOH would replace Br with something else.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. The IR at 1
