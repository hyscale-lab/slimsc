Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI elimination reaction, which is a type of dehydrohalogenation. Wait, no, wait. Wait, another thought: when alcohols react with HI and red phosphorus, it's usually a substitution reaction. Red phosphorus is a catalyst in the formation of H-I, which is a good nucleophile, right? So maybe it's an SN2 reaction.

But first, I need to figure out what Compound X is by looking at the IR and NMR data provided.

Let's look at the IR data first. The IR shows strong peaks around 3400-2500 cm⁻¹. That broad region is usually indicative of O-H or N-H stretching. But another peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ could be aromatic C=C stretching, so maybe there's a benzene ring involved.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which might correspond to an acidic proton. Could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But a broad peak might also suggest an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acid protons are usually broad because they're exchanging with water. Wait, but 10.5 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid; I thought they are around 10-12, but maybe it's just the case here.

Wait, what about aldehyde? Aldehydes have a sharp peak around 9-10 ppm. But the integration here is 1H, so maybe it's a proton next to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like in a phenol? Or perhaps it's an aldehyde.

Then, there's a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7
