Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

So the problem gives me a state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states. The state is written as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). 

The non-Gaussianity, nG, is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula provided is delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

The question asks for the nG when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

First, let me write down the given values. Phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(2phi) would be sin(-pi/2) which is -1. Alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. Exp(-2alpha²) is exp(-0.5) which is approximately 1/sqrt(e), about 0.6065.

Now, let's compute N. N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). Plugging in the values: sin(2phi) is -1, exp(-2alpha²) is ~0.6065. So 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Taking the square root gives N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, the normalization N is needed because |psi> must be a unit vector. So the state is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N.

But wait, what's the state structure? It's a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian states. So a superposition of two coherent states is typically a non-Gaussian state, unless they are in a specific way.

Wait, but when phi is such that the state becomes a coherent state itself, maybe it's Gaussian. Let me think. For instance, if phi is zero, then the state would be |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, if phi is pi/2, maybe it's | - alpha>, which is also Gaussian. What about other values of phi?

But in this case, phi is -pi/4. Let's calculate cos(phi) and sin(phi). Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. Wait, but the state is (0.7071 |0.5> -0.7071 | -0.5>)/N. So it's a symmetric superposition, but with a minus sign on the second term.

Wait, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are different. The state |alpha> is a displaced vacuum state with amplitude alpha in the positive real direction. |-alpha> is the same but in the negative real direction.

But when you take a superposition of these two, with a phase factor, what happens? For example, when phi is zero, you get |alpha>, which is Gaussian. When phi is pi/2, you get | - alpha>, which is also Gaussian. But when phi is something else, like pi/4, the state becomes a superposition of two different coherent states and thus is non-Gaussian.

So in this case, with phi = -pi/4, the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive, right?

But the options include D) 0, which would imply the state is Gaussian. So when does this happen? Let me think.

Wait, wait. If the state can be rewritten as a single coherent state, then it's Gaussian. Let's see. The state is [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

Is this a coherent state? Let me think about the sum.

A coherent state is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator, a. Let me write |beta> as the coherent state, which satisfies a|beta> = beta |beta>.

Suppose I take a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, maybe with some phase factors. Let me compute the sum.

Let me set beta = e^{i theta} alpha, perhaps. Let's see. The state is ( |alpha> + e^{i phi} |-alpha> ) / N.

Wait, but maybe for a specific phi, the state becomes a single coherent state. Let me think about what the sum would look like.

Wait, perhaps when the superposition can be written as a single coherent state. For instance, when phi is such that the coefficients make it a single coherent state.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a squeezed state or something else. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the superposition leads to a state that's Gaussian. For example, for certain phi, the state might be Gaussian.

Wait, but in our case, phi is -pi/4, which is 45 degrees, but negative. So the coefficients are cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So the state becomes [ sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 | -0.5> ] / N, with N ~0.6275.

But is this state Gaussian? I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about the density matrix.

Wait, the problem says that the relative entropy is between the non-Gaussian state and a reference Gaussian state. The nG is the difference between the entropy of the non-Gaussian state and the Gaussian reference.

Wait, but if the non-Gaussian state is itself Gaussian, then the difference would be zero, implying nG=0.

So when would our |psi> be Gaussian?

Wait, coherent states are Gaussian. The sum of two coherent states with coefficients could also form a Gaussian state if they are in a certain relation.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the structure of the state. |alpha> and |-alpha> are two coherent states. They are eigenstates of a and a†, respectively, but with different eigenvalues.

Let me compute the state when phi is -pi/4.

The state is (|alpha> - | - alpha> ) / sqrt(2). Because cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, so the numerator is sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> + (-sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> = (|alpha> - | - alpha> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but when you have a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, is that state Gaussian?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a squeezed state or a coherent state.

Wait, another approach: The density matrix of the state |psi> is |psi><psi|. For the state to be Gaussian, its density matrix must be that of a Gaussian state, which has a Wigner function that's Gaussian.

But perhaps for the specific case when phi is -pi/4, the state is actually a squeezed vacuum state. Because a squeezed vacuum is a superposition of two coherent states, but with a specific phase.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an even or odd coherent state. An even state is (|alpha> + | - alpha> ) / sqrt(2), and an odd state is (|alpha> - | - alpha> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, yes! So when phi is 0, the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. When phi is pi/2, the state is |-alpha>, also Gaussian. When phi is pi/4, the state is [ |alpha> + i | - alpha> ] / something. Hmm, but perhaps for phi = -pi/4, the state is an odd coherent state.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The state is (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi)| - alpha> ) / N.

If phi is -pi/4, then cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ |alpha> - | - alpha> ] / sqrt(2), assuming N is sqrt(2) in that case.

Wait, but wait, let's compute N for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5. Earlier, I found N≈0.6275.

Wait, but N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). For phi = -pi/4, sin(2phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. Exp(-2*(0.5)^2) is exp(-0.5)≈0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1-0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935)≈0.6275.

So the state is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, which is (approximately 0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 | -0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, but wait: When you have a superposition of |alpha> and | - alpha>, that's an even or an odd state. Let me think.

An even coherent state is (|alpha> + | - alpha> ) / sqrt(2), and the odd is (|alpha> - | - alpha> ) / sqrt(2). But these are specific cases. Are these states Gaussian?

Wait, I think even and odd coherent states are non-Gaussian. Because their Wigner functions are not Gaussian; they have interference terms.

Wait, no. Let me think again. I thought that even and odd states are non-Gaussian because they are superpositions, leading to non-Gaussian Wigner functions. So perhaps the state here is non-Gaussian, which would mean that the non-Gaussianity measure would be non-zero.

But wait, the options include D)0. So when would the non-Gaussianity be zero? That would happen when the state is Gaussian, so the relative entropy difference is zero.

Hmm. So perhaps when the state |psi> is a Gaussian state, meaning that it's a coherent state, or perhaps a squeezed state, or a thermal state, etc.

Wait, but when is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)| - alpha> )/N a Gaussian state?

Let me think about the parameters. Let me compute N again. N = sqrt( 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) )

Let me see what happens when phi is 0: sin(2*0) = 0, so N=1. The state becomes |alpha>, which is Gaussian. So in that case, nG would be zero because rho is the same as the reference Gaussian state.

Similarly, when phi is pi/2, sin(2phi)=sin(pi)=0, so N=1. The state becomes |-alpha>, which is Gaussian.

What about when phi is pi/4: sin(2pi/4) = sin(pi/2)=1. So N= sqrt(1 + exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Wait, alpha is 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is ~0.6065. So N = sqrt(1 + 0.6065) = sqrt(1.6065)≈1.267.

So the state is (cos(pi/4)|0.5> + sin(pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 1.267.

But is this state Gaussian? Probably not, because it's a superposition of two different coherent states unless they combine into a single coherent state.

Wait, another approach: the state |psi> can be rewritten as e^{i theta} |beta>, where beta is some complex number, only if the superposition can be expressed as a single coherent state. Otherwise, it's a non-Gaussian state.

So let me try to see if this is possible.

Assume that |alpha> and |-alpha> can be combined into a single coherent state.

Wait, |alpha> = e^{alpha a† - alpha^* a} |0>, and |-alpha> = e^{-alpha a† + alpha^* a} |0>.

So adding these, perhaps with coefficients, can we write them as a single coherent state?

Alternatively, perhaps using some identities.

Wait, maybe for certain phi, the state becomes a coherent state.

Wait, let me consider the case when the state is (|alpha> + i | - alpha> ) / sqrt(2). That's similar to what happens when phi is pi/4.

Wait, but let me compute N in that case. For phi= pi/4, sin(2phi)=1. So N= sqrt(1 + exp(-2 alpha^2)).

But unless N is 1, it's not a coherent state. So unless exp(-2 alpha^2) is zero, which it's not, N is greater than 1. So the state can't be a coherent state in this case.

Therefore, in general, the state is non-Gaussian unless phi is 0 or pi/2.

Wait, but in our problem, phi is -pi/4, which is not 0 or pi/2. So the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So the answer can't be D)0.

Hmm, but wait a second. Another possibility: the reference Gaussian state tau is chosen to be the closest Gaussian approximation to the non-Gaussian state rho. In that case, the relative entropy might be positive, meaning nG is positive.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the relative entropy is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Wait, no: the formula given is delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

But wait, relative entropy, also called Kullback-Leibler divergence, is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = trace(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). This is always non-negative. So if the state is Gaussian, then rho would be the same as tau, so delta_b would be zero. But if rho is non-Gaussian, then delta_b would be positive, meaning that rho has higher entropy than the reference Gaussian tau.

Wait, but wait. The relative entropy is not symmetric. So if tau is a Gaussian state, and rho is the non-Gaussian state, the relative entropy S(rho || tau) is not necessarily the same as S(tau || rho).

So in our case, the formula given is delta_b = S(rho) - S(tau), which is the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau.

Wait, but wait: if rho is Gaussian, then S(rho) would be the entropy of a Gaussian state, and tau is another Gaussian state. But if rho is non-Gaussian, its entropy would be higher than that of the closest Gaussian state tau.

Wait, not necessarily. The entropy of a Gaussian state is determined by its covariance matrix. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the entropy is (1/2) ln(2 pi e sigma^2), where sigma is the standard deviation of the quadrature.

But for a non-Gaussian state, the entropy can be higher or lower depending on the state. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the reference Gaussian state tau is the vacuum state. Let me think.

Wait, no, because the non-Gaussian state is a superposition of two coherent states, each with amplitude alpha and -alpha. The reference Gaussian state might be another state, perhaps the vacuum, a coherent state, or a thermal state. But without knowing what tau is, it's hard to compute the relative entropy.

Wait, but the problem states that the relative entropy is given by that formula, and we are to compute the non-Gaussianity using that. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the entropy of the state and compare it to a specific Gaussian state.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the structure of the state. When phi is -pi/4, the state is (|alpha> - | - alpha> ) / N. As we saw, this is an odd coherent state, which is a known non-Gaussian state. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But the options include 0, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says "using relative entropy measure." So the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between the state and the reference Gaussian. But if the state is Gaussian, the relative entropy would be zero.

Wait, but when is the state Gaussian? Let me think. If, for some reason, the state |psi> is a Gaussian state, then tau could be the same as rho, leading to nG=0.

But when is the state Gaussian? For example, if the state can be written as a Gaussian wavefunction, then it is Gaussian. Coherent states are Gaussian. Thermal states are Gaussian. Squeezed states are Gaussian.

But is the state |psi> for phi=-pi/4 a Gaussian state?

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me compute the density matrix of |psi> and see if it's Gaussian.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. The state is (|alpha> - | - alpha> ) / N, where N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6275.

The density matrix would be (|alpha> - | - alpha> ) ( <alpha| - < - alpha| ) / N².

Expanding this: (|alpha><alpha| - |alpha>< - alpha| - | - alpha><alpha| + | - alpha>< - alpha| ) / N².

So rho has four terms. The first and last terms are |alpha><alpha| and | - alpha>< - alpha|, which are Gaussian. The cross terms are -|alpha>< - alpha| and -| - alpha><alpha|.

But wait, are these cross terms Gaussian? Well, the problem is that the coherences between |alpha> and | - alpha> involve terms that are not present in a single-mode Gaussian state.

Because a single-mode Gaussian state has a density matrix of the form exp( - (a a† - a† a ) / 2 + ... ), which doesn't have terms like |alpha><-alpha|. So in the density matrix rho, these cross terms are non-Gaussian.

Therefore, the state rho is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity nG should be positive, so the answer can't be D)0.

Wait, but perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the vacuum state, which is Gaussian. Let's try to think about that.

If tau is the vacuum density matrix, then what would be the relative entropy?

But the problem says that the relative entropy measure is given as delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Wait, no: the relative entropy is usually defined as trace(rho ln rho - rho ln tau), which is the same as trace(rho ln (rho/tau)).

In that case, the relative entropy is always non-negative, and it measures how non-Gaussian the state is. So if rho is Gaussian, then the relative entropy would be zero when tau is the same Gaussian state. But in our case, tau is a different Gaussian state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that rho would become if it were Gaussian. But without knowing what tau is, I can't compute the exact value.

Wait, but the problem gives the formula for delta_b as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is the same as (S(rho) - S(tau)), where S is the von Neumann entropy.

Wait, but that's not the standard relative entropy. The standard relative entropy is S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(tau) - trace(rho ln tau).

Wait, no: S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau) = S(rho) - S(rho; tau), where S(rho; tau) is the conditional entropy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho). The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau).

But the problem's formula is delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau), where S(rho) is the entropy of rho, and S(tau) is the entropy of tau, because S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho), so trace(rho ln rho) = - S(rho).

Wait, no: because S(rho) is - trace(rho ln rho), so trace(rho ln rho) = - S(rho).

Hmm, okay, let me think again. So delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] = (- S(rho)) - (- S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho).

Wait, because S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho), so trace(rho ln rho) = - S(rho). Similarly, trace(tau ln tau) = - S(tau).

So delta_b = (- S(rho) ) - (- S(tau) ) ) = S(tau) - S(rho).

So delta_b = S(tau) - S(rho).

Wait, but that's the opposite of the relative entropy. Usually, relative entropy S(rho||tau) = S(rho) - S(rho; tau) = S(rho) - [S(rho|tau) + S(tau)], but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

In any case, the formula given is delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Which equals [ - S(rho) ] - [ - S(tau) ] = S(tau) - S(rho).

So delta_b = S(tau) - S(rho).

Wait, but the
