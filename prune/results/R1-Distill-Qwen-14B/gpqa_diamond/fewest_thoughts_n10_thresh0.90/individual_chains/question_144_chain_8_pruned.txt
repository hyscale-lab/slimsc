Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read it again: X is a meson resonance. The question is about the mean decay distance. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons have a certain lifetime before they decay, and the mean decay distance is related to how fast they're moving and how long they live. So the decay distance (d) should be the product of the particle's velocity (v) and its lifetime (τ), right? So d = v * τ.

Wait, but first I need to find the lifetime τ of the meson. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty relation says that the product of the energy uncertainty (Γ, which is the width) and the time uncertainty (τ) is on the order of ħ (reduced Planck's constant). So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ, which gives τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should be precise. The exact formula for the lifetime in particle physics is τ = ħ / Γ. So, yes, that's the way to go. So I can compute τ first.

Then, I need to find the velocity. The velocity depends on the energy and mass of the particle. Since the particle is moving relativistically, I'll probably need to use the energy-momentum relation.

The total energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So, the energy is much larger than the mass, which means it's a high-energy particle, and maybe moving at a speed close to the speed of light.

The relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². I can solve for the momentum p: p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)²) / c.

Once I have p, I can find the velocity using the relation p = γ m v, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Alternatively, I can find the velocity from beta (β) since β = v/c, and β = p c / (E).

Wait, let me think. Since E = γ m c² and p = γ m v. So, another way to get β is p c / E = (γ m v c) / (γ m c²) ) = v / c. So yes, β = (p c) / E.

So, steps to take:

1. Compute the momentum p using E and m: p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

But wait, the units here are in GeV. I need to convert them to SI units so that I can calculate c in m/s.

Wait, perhaps I can manage the units more carefully. Let me think about the energy and mass in units where c=1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's proceed step by step.

First, let's compute E, m, Γ in Joules because I need to calculate in SI units.

So, 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.

E_X = 8 GeV = 8e9 eV → 8e9 * 1.60218e-19 J = 1.281744e-9 J.

m_X = 1.2 GeV/c² → but wait, when converting to kg, I think the formula is m (kg) = E (GeV) / (c² * (1.60218e-13 J/GeV)).

Wait, correct formula: 1 GeV/c² is approximately 1.7827e-27 kg. Because E = mc² → m = E/(c²). So 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J, so 1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J. So 1 GeV/c² is (1.60218e-10 J) / (c²) → but c is about 3e8 m/s, so c² is 9e16 m²/s².

So m_X = 1.2 GeV/c² → 1.2 * (1.60218e-10 J) / (9e16 m²/s²) ) = 1.2 * (1.60218e-10) / 9e16 kg.

Wait, let's compute that:

1.60218e-10 / 9e16 = 1.60218e-10 / 9e16 ≈ 1.780198e-27 kg per GeV/c².

So 1.2 GeV/c² is 1.2 * 1.780198e-27 kg ≈ 2.136e-27 kg.

Wait, alternatively, I think 1 GeV/c² is about 1.7827e-27 kg, so 1.2 GeV/c² is 1.2 * 1.7827e-27 ≈ 2.139e-27 kg. Okay.

Similarly, Γ_X is 320 MeV → 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV =
