Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. Let's see, the goal is to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid needed to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution, and then determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and can react with a strong acid. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. So, the acid will donate H+ ions to dissolve the Fe(OH)3.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 I have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Iron is about 55.85 g/mol, Oxygen is 16, and Hydrogen is 1. So, 55.85 + (3*(16+1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol. Oh wait, wait, wait, no: wait, Fe(OH)3 has one Fe, three O from each OH? No, each OH is O and H. So each OH is 16+1 =17, times 3: 51. Plus Fe (55.85). So yeah, 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85—let me compute that.

0.1 / 106.85 = 0.00093597 mol, approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, the reaction equation: Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. So, for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+.

So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.00093597 ≈ 0.0028079 moles.

The acid is monobasic and strong, so it will fully dissociate. Let's assume it's HCl, for example. So, the concentration is 0.1 M. The volume needed (V) can be found by moles = M * V → V = moles / M.

So V = 0.0028079 / 0.1 = 0.028079 liters, which is 28.079 cm³. Wait, but wait, the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh no, wait, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. So wait, the solution's total volume is 100 cm³, which includes the acid volume.

Wait, but the acid's volume is being added, so the total volume might be larger than 100 cm³? Or is it that the solution after reaction has a total volume of 100 cm³, and the acid's volume is part of that? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just about the amount of acid needed, regardless of the final volume.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "dissolve ... in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed...". So the total solution after adding the acid and dissolving the Fe(OH)3 is 100 cm3. So the acid volume plus the solution volume equals 100 cm³.

Wait, but when you add the acid, the volume might change. But maybe it's assumed that the volumes are additive, so the volume of the acid is just what's needed to get the moles required, without considering any change in volume upon mixing. So perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume, which includes the acid and the solution.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation I have. So, if I need 0.0028079 moles of H+, then the volume of 0.1 M acid is 0.0028079 / 0.1 = 0.028079 liters, which is 28.079 cm³. So approximately 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³, which is close. But wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the molar mass. Fe is 55.845 g/mol, each OH is 17. So 55.845 + 3*(17) = 55.845 + 51 = 106.845 g/mol. So 0.1 g is 0.1 / 106.845 ≈ 0.0009358 mol. So 3 times that is 0.0028074 mol H+ needed.

So, with
