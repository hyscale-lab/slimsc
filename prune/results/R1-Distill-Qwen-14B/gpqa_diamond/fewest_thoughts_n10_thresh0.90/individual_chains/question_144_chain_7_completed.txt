Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance, and we need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with varying values in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula, I think, is something like L = gamma * c * tau * beta, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, tau is the proper lifetime, and beta is v/c.

But wait, how do I find tau? Oh right, the mean proper lifetime tau is related to the width Γ. I think the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy ΔE, so Γ * tau ≈ ħ. Therefore, tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I should double-check the exact formula. I think Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy width of the resonance. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: Γ is the total width, and it's related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / tau. Because the width is the inverse of the lifetime. So tau = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, when units are involved, I have to be careful. The natural units in particle physics often set ħ = c = 1, but when converting to meters or seconds, I need to include those constants.

So, first, I need to compute tau (the lifetime). Tau is ħ divided by Γ.

Hmm, what's ħ in units that are useful here? ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But eV is 1.602e-19 J, so ħ in GeV·s would be hbar = 6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

So, ħ = 6.5823e-25 GeV·s. Got it.

Now, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So, tau = (6.5823e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.5823e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.05696875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.5823e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me calculate that. 6.5823 / 0.32 is roughly 20.5696875. So 20.5696875e-25 s is 2.05696875e-24 seconds. Yeah.

Next, I need to find gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is E / (m c²), but since we're using units where c=1, E is the total energy, and m is the rest mass. But wait, E is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

But wait, I can write gamma as (E)/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.666... So gamma = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, beta is v/c. For a relativistic particle, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) )? Wait, no. Wait, beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2) )? Let me think. Or wait, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²) ). Let's compute that.

gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/gamma² is 9/400 = 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately sqrt(0.9775). Let me calculate that. Let me see, 0.9775 is about 0.9887^2? Wait, 0.988 squared is about 0.976. 0.989 squared is about 0.978. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. Let's say approximately 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, but maybe it's better to calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, for high gamma, beta is approximately 1, but here gamma is about 6.66, so beta is less than 1, but close.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute beta using the relation E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Then, beta = p c / E.

Wait, yes. Since momentum p is sqrt( (E^2 - (m c²)^2 ) ) / (c^2 ), but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of beta = (p c) / E.

So, E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (p c)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So p c = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

Beta is (p c)/(E) = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. So that's about 0.98875, which matches the earlier approximation.

So beta is approximately 0.98875.

Now, gamma is about 6.6667.

We have tau, the proper lifetime, as 2.05696875e-24 seconds.

The mean lifetime from the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma * tau. Because time dilation: moving clocks run slower, so the lifetime in lab frame is longer.

Wait no, wait: Proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the rest frame. So from the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

So, tau_lab = gamma * tau ≈ 6.6667 * 2.05696875e-24 s.

Let me compute that: 6.6667 * 2.05696875e-24 ≈ 13.646e-24 s.

Wait, 6.6667 * 2.05696875 = about 13.646, so 13.646e-24 s.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is approximately 1.3646e-23 seconds.

Wait, wait, wait: Let me compute 6.6667 * 2.05696875e-24.

6.6667 * 2.05696875 = approx 6.6667 * 2.057 ≈ let's see:

6 * 2.057 is about 12.342, and 0.6667 * 2.057 ≈ 1.371, so total approx 13.713. So 13.713e-24 s is 1.3713e-23 s.

Wait, but wait, wait. Is the lab frame the one moving, or is the particle moving? Hmm, the tau is the proper lifetime, so when the particle is moving, its lifetime from the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the lifetime in the lab is gamma * tau.

So now, the mean decay distance is L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Because, velocity v = beta c. So v = beta c. The time in lab frame is gamma tau. So the distance is v * t = beta c * gamma tau.

Yes, that's correct. So L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

We have beta ≈ 0.98875, gamma ≈ 6.6667, c ≈ 3e8 m/s, tau ≈ 2.05696875e-24 s.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, I thought tau is the proper lifetime. Then tau_lab = gamma * tau. So the decay occurs in the lab frame, so the time is gamma tau, and the distance is v * (gamma tau).

So L = v * (gamma tau) = beta c * gamma tau = beta gamma c tau.

Which is the same as beta * gamma * c * tau.

Yes, that's correct.

So, substituting the numbers:

beta = 0.98875, gamma = 6.6667, c = 3e8 m/s, tau = 2.05696875e-24 s.

So:

L = 0.98875 * 6.6667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s.

Let me compute step by step.

First, multiply 0.98875 and 6.6667.

0.98875 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.6.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

0.98875 * 6.6667.

Hmm, 6.6667 is 20/3. 0.98875 * 20/3 = (0.98875 * 20)/3 ≈ 19.775 /3 ≈ 6.5917.

So approximately 6.5917.

Then, 3e8 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s = (3e8) * (2.05696875e-24) = 6.17090625e-16 m.

Because 3e8 * 2.05696875e-24 = 3 * 2.05696875e-16 = 6.17090625e-16 meters.

Now, multiply all three terms:

6.5917 * 6.17090625e-16 m.

Wait, 6.5917 * 6.17090625 ≈ let's compute that.

First, 6 * 6 = 36, but let me do exact:

6.5917 * 6.17090625.

Hmm, 6 * 6.1709 is 37.0254.

0.5917 * 6.1709 ≈ approximately 3.653.

So total approx 37.0254 + 3.653 = 40.678.

So 6.5917 * 6.17090625e-16 ≈ 40.678e-16 m = 4.0678e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.0678e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 meters, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m, which is about 5e-15.

Hmm, so my approximate calculation gives about 4.0678e-15 m, which is very close to option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me redo some steps more accurately.

Wait, let me compute beta * gamma:

beta = 0.98875, gamma = 6.6667.

0.98875 * 6.6667 = let's compute:

6.6667 * 0.98875 = ?

Compute 6 * 0.98875 = 5.9325.

0.6667 * 0.98875 = approx 0.6667*0.98875.

Compute 0.6667 * 0.98875:

0.6667 * 0.98875 = 0.6667 * (1 - 0.01125) ≈ 0.6667 - 0.6667*0.01125.

0.6667 * 0.01125 = approximately 0.0075.

So 0.6667 - 0.0075 = 0.6592.

So total beta*gamma ≈ 5.9325 + 0.6592 = 6.5917. So that part's correct.

Then, c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s = 6.17090625e-16 m.

Then, L = 6.5917 * 6.17090625e-16 m.

Wait, 6.5917 * 6.17090625 = let me compute this exactly.

6.5917 * 6.17090625.

Let me compute 6 * 6.17090625 = 37.0254375.

0.5917 * 6.17090625.

0.5 * 6.17090625 = 3.085453125.

0.0917 * 6.17090625 ≈ let's compute 0.09 *6.17090625 = 0.5553815625, and 0.0017 *6.17090625=0.0104905406. So total 0.5553815625 + 0.0104905406 ≈ 0.5658721031.

So 3.085453125 + 0.5658721031 ≈ 3.651325228.

So total 37.0254375 + 3.651325228 ≈ 40.67676273.

So 40.67676273e-16 m = 4.067676273e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0677e-15 m. So option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close enough, considering the approximation.

But wait, perhaps I should use more precise values in the calculations to get a more accurate result.

Let me try to compute beta more accurately.

Earlier, beta was calculated using p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.

Wait, wait, 62.56 is 62.56, square root is sqrt(62.56) = approx 7.91 GeV.

Wait, 7.91^2 = 62.5681, so yes.

So beta = p c / E = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

Let me compute 7.91 /8.

7.91 divided by 8.

8 × 0.98875 is 7.91.

So 7.91 /8 = 0.98875. So that's accurate.

But perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I should not approximate beta*gamma so quickly.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more precise approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta*gamma exactly.

Beta = 0.98875, gamma=6.6667.

So 0.98875 * 6.6667.

Let me compute 0.98875 * 6.6667.

6.6667 is 20/3.

So 0.98875 * 20/3.

Compute 0.98875 * 20 = 19.775.

Divide by 3: 19.775 /3 = 6.591666667.

So beta*gamma = 6.591666667.

Then, c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s.

Wait, 3e8 is 3 *1e8, so 3e8 * 2.05696875e-24 = 3 *2.05696875e-16 = 6.17090625e-16 m.

So L = 6.591666667 * 6.17090625e-16 m.

Compute 6.591666667 *6.17090625.

Let me compute it as:

6 *6.17090625 = 37.0254375.

0.591666667 *6.17090625 = ?

Compute 0.5 *6.17090625 =3.085453125.

0.091666667 *6.17090625.

Compute 0.09 *6.17090625=0.5553815625.

0.001666667 *6.17090625=0.01028484375.

So total 0.5553815625 +0.01028484375=0.56566640625.

So 3.085453125 +0.56566640625=3.65111953125.

Total L=37.0254375 +3.65111953125=40.67655703125e-16 m.

Which is 4.067655703125e-15 m.

So L ≈4.06766e-15 m.

Hmm, the options are:

A)5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

So 4.067e-15 is closest to option B, 4.0655e-15.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation with the units. Let me double-check the units in the tau calculation.

Tau is ħ/(Γ). So ħ is 6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = 6.5823e-25 /0.32 = let's compute that more accurately.

6.5823e-25 /0.32 = (6.5823 /0.32 )e-25.

6.5823 /0.32 = 20.5696875.

So tau = 20.5696875e-25 s =2.05696875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculations look correct. So the answer should be option B) 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but looking back, my final L was approximately 4.06766e-15 m, which is a bit higher than option B's 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, but perhaps the exact calculation would give the precise option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ. Let's see.

The exact value of ħ is 6.582332963e-25 GeV·s. Let me take ħ as 6.582332963e-25 for more precision.

So tau = ħ / Γ = 6.582332963e-25 / 0.32 GeV.

Compute that: 6.582332963 /0.32 = 20.569790509375.

So tau = 20.569790509375e-25 s = 2.0569790509375e-24 s.

So, beta*gamma = 6.591666667.

c * tau =3e8 m/s * 2.0569790509375e-24 s = 3e8 *2.0569790509375e-24 = 6.1709371528125e-16 m.

Then, L = 6.591666667 *6.1709371528125e-16.

Compute 6.591666667 *6.1709371528125.

Let me compute this more accurately.

6.591666667 = 6 + 0.591666667.

6 *6.1709371528125 = 37.025622916875.

0.591666667 *6.1709371528125.

Compute 0.5 *6.1709371528125 =3.08546857640625.

0.091666667 *6.1709371528125.

Compute 0.09 *6.1709371528125 =0.555384343753125.

0.001666667 *6.1709371528125= 0.0102848952546875.

So total 0.555384343753125 +0.0102848952546875=0.5656692390078125.

So 3.08546857640625 +0.5656692390078125 =3.6511378154140625.

Adding to the 37.025622916875 gives 37.025622916875 +3.6511378154140625 =40.67676073228906.

So L=40.67676073228906e-16 m =4.067676073228906e-15 m.

Hmm, that's about 4.0677e-15 m. So the options are:

Option B:4.0655e-15.

Option D:4.0655e-16.

Wait, but my calculation gave 4.0677e-15, which is close to option B's 4.0655e-15, but a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the beta*gamma term.

Wait, let me compute beta*gamma precisely.

Beta was calculated as 7.91 GeV /8 GeV =0.98875.

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

So beta*gamma = 0.98875 *6.666666666666667.

0.98875 *6 =5.9325.

0.98875 *0.666666666666667=0.98875 * (2/3) ≈0.6591666666666666.

So total beta*gamma=5.9325+0.6591666666666666=6.591666666666666.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for c.

c is approximately 2.99792458e8 m/s.

So let me use c=2.99792458e8 m/s.

Then, c * tau =2.99792458e8 m/s * 2.0569790509375e-24 s.

Compute that: 2.99792458e8 *2.0569790509375e-24 = (2.99792458 *2.0569790509375 )e-16.

2.99792458 *2.0569790509375 ≈ let me compute:

2 *2.05697905 =4.1139581.

0.99792458 *2.05697905 ≈.

Compute 1 *2.05697905=2.05697905.

Subtract 0.00207542 *2.05697905≈0.004265.

So 2.05697905 -0.004265≈2.052714.

So total 4.1139581 +2.052714≈6.166672.

So 6.166672e-16 m.

Then, L =6.591666666666666 *6.166672e-16 m.

Compute 6.591666666666666 *6.166672.

6 *6.166672=37.000032.

0.591666666666666 *6.166672≈.

0.5 *6.166672=3.083336.

0.0916666666666666 *6.166672≈0.0916666666666666 *6=0.55, and 0.0916666666666666 *0.166672≈0.015277777777777774.

So 0.55 +0.015277777777777774=0.5652777777777777.

So 3.083336 +0.5652777777777777=3.648613777777777.

Total L=37.000032 +3.648613777777777=40.64864577777777e-16 m.

Which is 4.064864577777777e-15 m.

Hmm, that's about 4.06486e-15 m.

So, with more precise calculation, it comes to about 4.06486e-15 m.

The options are B:4.0655e-15 and D:4.0655e-16.

So 4.06486e-15 is very close to 4.0655e-15 meters, which is option B.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar = 6.5823 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.5823 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.05696875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),

we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) can be calculated using the relation:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E},
\]

where \( p c \) is the momentum. Using the energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2,
\]

we solve for \( p c \):

\[
p c = \sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta \approx 0.98875 \),
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.05696875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = 0.98875 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.05696875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, compute \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.98875 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5917.
\]

Next, compute \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.05696875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.17090625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Finally, compute \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5917 \cdot 6.17090625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0677 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.0677 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.
