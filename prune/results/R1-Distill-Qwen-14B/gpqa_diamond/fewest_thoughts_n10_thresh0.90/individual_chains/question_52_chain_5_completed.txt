Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll walk through my thoughts step by step.

The question is about stars with and without dark spots affecting the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. So, when the star doesn't have spots, its effective temperature is higher, but when 40% of its surface is covered, the overall temperature drops. And when the spots are present, the ratio of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) )

So, the ratio depends exponentially on the temperature. Oh right, because when temperature changes, the populations of the energy levels change accordingly.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff drops from 6000K to 5500K. So the temperature is lower when spots are present. But the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. Let me think: the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), because if T decreases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. Wait wait, because if T is lower, the exponential term is larger, meaning n1/n2 is higher. But the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, let me clarify. The ratio is n1/n2. The Boltzmann factor is exp( (E1 - E2)/(kT) ), but wait, E2 is higher than E1, right? Because level 2 is higher in energy. So (E2 - E1) is positive. So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So when T is lower, the exponent becomes a larger negative number. So the exponential term becomes smaller. So if T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases because the exponential term is getting smaller. Oh, that makes sense.

Wait, so when the spots are present, T is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Which matches the problem statement. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So we need to find the ratio of (n1/n2) when no spots are present to when spots are present.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Let me compute this factor. Let me denote T1 as 6000 K and T2 as 5500 K.

The ratio is [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so the factor is exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T1) + (E2-E1)/(k T2) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, 1/T2 is less than 1/T1 since T2 is lower than T1. So 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) is positive. Therefore, the exponent is positive.

But wait, E2-E1 is positive, and the term would be positive. So the exponential is e^{ positive }, which is greater than 1. So the factor is greater than 1, meaning the ratio without spots is higher than when spots are present.

Wait, but let's get back to the factor. The problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the factor is (no spots) / (spots) = higher number. So the ratio increases when there's no spots, which is what the question is about.

The next part is to compute this factor. We need to know E2-E1, but we're given the wavelength of the transition between the two levels: approximately 1448 Å. Oh, so that's the photon emitted when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1. So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

Let me compute E2 - E1. Let's compute that using hc over the wavelength.

I remember that hc is about 12400 eV·Å. So λ is 1448 Å. So E = 12400 / 1448 ≈ let me calculate that.

1448 × 8 is 11584, 1448 × 8.5 is about 12308, which is close to 12400. So 8.5 would be 12308. So 12400-12308=92. So 92/(1448) ≈ 0.0636. So approximately 8.56 eV.

So E = 8.56 eV. But wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules, but maybe I don't need to convert to joules because we'll use it in terms of k*T.

Wait, the Boltzmann constant k is about 8.617e-5 eV per K. So, E in eV, T in K.

So E = 8.56 eV.

The exponent in the ratio factor is (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ].

Wait, let me compute the term inside the exponent:

(E2-E1)/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] 

E in eV, k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, let's compute (E)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

E = 8.56 eV

1/T2 is 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1

1/T1 is 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1

Difference: 1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4 = 1.51e-5 K^-1

So, (E/(k)) is 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ let's calculate:

8.56 / 8.617e-5 = 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ approximately 8.56 / 8.6e-5.

Wait, 8.6e-5 is 0.000086. So 8.56 / 0.000086.

Let me compute that. 8.56 / 0.000086 = (8.56 * 1e5) / 8.6 ≈ 856000 / 8.6 ≈ let's see: 8.6 * 100,000 is 860,000. So 856,000 is about 99535 * 8.6 ≈ wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 8.56 / 8.6e-5 = 8.56 / 0.000086 = 8.56 * (1/0.000086) ≈ 8.56 * 11627.9 ≈ Let me compute 8 * 11627.9 = 93,023.2, 0.56 * 11627.9≈6550.8. So total approximately 99,574.

So E/(k) ≈ 99,574 K.

Now, multiply by (1/T2 - 1/T1) which is 1.51e-5 K^-1.

So 99,574 * 1.51e-5 ≈ 99,574 * 0.0000151 ≈ Let me compute 1e5 * 0.0000151 = 1.51. So 99,574 is ≈ 99,574 ≈ ~1e5. So 1e5 * 0.0000151 is 1.51. So 99,574 * 0.0000151 is approximately 1.505.

Wait, but more accurately: 99,574 * 1.51e-5.

Let me compute 99,574 * 1.51e-5:

1.51e-5 is 0.0000151.

99,574 * 0.0000151.

Let me compute 100,000 * 0.0000151 = 1.51. So minus 426 (since 100,000-99,574=426) * 0.0000151 = 426 * 1.51e-5 ≈ 0.00643.

So 1.51 - 0.00643 ≈ 1.5036.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5036.

So the factor is exp(1.5036) ≈ e^1.5036. What's e^1.5?

e^1 = 2.718, e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817. e^0.0036 is approx 1.0036. So 4.4817 * 1.0036 ≈ 4.499.

So about 4.5, which would be option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated the term (1/T2 -1/T1). Let's double-check:

1/5500 = approximately 0.000181818 K^-1

1/6000 = approximately 0.000166667 K^-1

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151 K^-1.

So 1.5151e-5 K^-1.

E/(k) is about 99,574 K.

So 99,574 * 1.5151e-5 = 99,574 * 0.000015151.

Let me compute 99,574 * 0.000015151.

Hmm, 99,574 * 1.5151e-5.

Wait, 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = 1.5151. So 99,574 is 99,574 = 9.9574e4.

So 9.9574e4 * 1.5151e-5 = (9.9574 * 1.5151) * 1e-1.

9.9574 * 1.5151 ≈ Let me compute 10 * 1.5151 =15.151, minus 0.0426 * 1.5151.

0.0426 *1.5151 ≈ 0.0645, so 15.151 - 0.0645 ≈ 15.0865.

Multiply by 1e-1: 1.50865.

So the exponent is about 1.50865.

e^1.50865 is approximately e^1.50865. Let me compute.

I know that ln(4.5) is around 1.504, because ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, so e^1.504 ≈4.5.

Wait, yes. Because e^1.504077 is exactly 4.5: because ln(4.5) ≈1.504077.

So our exponent is 1.50865, which is slightly higher than 1.504077. So e^1.50865 is a bit higher than 4.5.

Compute e^0.004573 more accurately. Because 1.504077 + 0.004573=1.50865.

So e^0.004573 ≈1 + 0.004573 + (0.004573)^2/2 ≈ 1.004573 + 0.00001045 ≈1.004583.

So 4.5 * 1.004583 ≈4.5 *1.004583 ≈4.5206.

So approximately 4.52.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, so the answer should be option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does, we use the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]

The ratio of the populations depends on the temperature \(T\), where \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the two levels. The problem provides the effective temperatures of the star: \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (with spots). The transition wavelength is given as \(1448 \, \text{Å}\), which corresponds to the energy difference \(E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\). Using \(hc \approx 12400 \, \text{eV·Å}\), we calculate:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{12400}{1448} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant is \(k \approx 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation, the \(g_1/g_2\) terms cancel, leaving:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

First, calculate \(1/T_2 - 1/T_1\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \approx 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Next, compute \((E_2 - E_1)/k\):

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,574 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, multiply:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,574 \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.50865.
\]

Finally, evaluate the exponential:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.50865) \approx 4.52.
\]

This matches closely with option C, which is approximately \(4.5\). Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is:

**Answer: C**
