Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and products for three different reactions, labeled A, B, and C. The question gives me four options, each with different products for A, B, and C. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll try to understand each of the reactions one by one.

Starting with reaction A: It's a Michael addition between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, using NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. 

Wait, Michael addition is when a nucleophile (the enolate) attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The enolate is formed from a beta-keto ester or similar, right? So dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, which can form an enolate easily.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the acrylate group is E-configuration, so the substituents on either end are opposite each other. The p-tolyl group is attached to the acrylate. So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position of this acrylate, where does the addition happen?

The enolate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So, the acrylate is the Michael acceptor here. Let me draw this in my mind. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with the central CH2 substituted by a p-tolyl group. Wait, no, the structure is probably CH2=CH-C-O-OCH3, but the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, maybe it's something like CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so 3-(p-tolyl) would be the substituent on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-position is the CH2 part. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the structure where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2-C(=O)-COOCH3? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait, no, the acrylate is usually CH2=CHCOO-. So the substituent is at the 3-position. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OOCCH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, the molecule is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the second carbon of the acrylate. Maybe I should think about it differently. Regardless, the key is that the acrylate is the acceptor, and the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is a strong enough base to form the enolate) will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me think about the structure. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3O)2CCH2COOCH3? No, wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. So when deprotonated at the alpha position, it forms an enolate with a negative charge on the central carbon. This enolate will attack the acrylate.

In a Michael addition,
