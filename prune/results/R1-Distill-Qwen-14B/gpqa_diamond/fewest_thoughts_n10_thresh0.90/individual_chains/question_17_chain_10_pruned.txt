Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh, and the pH is ideal, which I think means we don't have to worry about the EDTA being protonated or anything like that. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, I guess. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed here is Ca-EDTA. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- or something like that. Wait, no, EDTA is usually H4Y, and in solution, it can lose protons. But since the pH is ideal, maybe we don't have to consider that. So the formation constant K is for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2−, and K is 5e10.

Wait, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So initially, without any dissociation, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But because the complex can dissociate, some of it will break down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So K is a very large number, which means the complex is very stable, so the dissociation won't be much. But let's proceed.

Let me denote the dissociation as:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

Let the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium be x. Since the dissociation is small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so the change can be approximated. So if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then, after dissociation, it's 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. And the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will each be x.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, is the EDTA in solution just from the dissociation? Or is there any free EDTA initially? Because in the solution, the only source of EDTA is the complex dissociating. So initially, the solution has only the complex. So, the only species are the complex and the ions it dissociates into.

Wait, no. Because the complex is made of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in a 1:1 ratio. So, when the complex dissociates, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2-.

Let me set up the variables. Let's let the change be x, where x is the concentration of Ca²+ produced. So, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02 / x².

Given that K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Then, x² = 0.02 / 5e10

Let me compute that
