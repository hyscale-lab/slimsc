Alright, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about neutrino flux from the Sun, specifically comparing two energy bands. Hmm, okay, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and the pp chain is a big one, especially in the core.

The question says that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's roughly the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III stopped, the effect would be noticeable on Earth only after that time delay. But the question is about the neutrino flux now, so we're looking at the situation after that time.

The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The main source of solar energy. So if this branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that part would cease. But wait, how does the pp-III branch affect neutrino production?

I think the proton-proton chain produces neutrinos mainly in the pp-I branch, which is the dominant one. The pp-II and pp-III are less significant. Oh wait, wait. The pp-I branch is the main one, which produces two positrons and two neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III are higher energy processes and contribute less. So if pp-III stops, maybe the production of a specific type of neutrino (like the Beryllium-7 neutrinos) would be affected, but I'm not sure.

Wait, neutrinos from the Sun come from different processes. The main ones are the proton-proton chain (pp) and the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain produces neutrinos with lower energies, while the CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. Oh wait, no, actually, the majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp chain, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. The CNO contributes a smaller fraction but higher energy.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The pp chain's main branch, pp-I, produces neutrinos at around 0.5 MeV (or lower?), but wait, the question is about neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV ranges. So that's lower than a MeV (since 1 MeV is 1000 keV). Wait, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, 800 is 0.8 MeV, 900 is 0.9 MeV.

So neutrinos from the pp chain have lower energies, while the CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, which part of the neutrino flux is affected?

Wait, the pp chain produces two types: the main pp-I, which produces lower-energy neutrinos (like ~0.5 MeV), and the pp-II and pp-III which produce higher-energy neutrinos. So pp-III is a branch that produces higher energy neutrinos compared to pp-I.

If pp-III stops, the flux of higher energy neutrinos (like from 0.7 to 0.9 MeV) would drop, while the lower energies would remain the same (since pp-I is still active).

So the question is about the ratio of flux between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Before the pp-III stopped, both bands would have some flux. But after stopping, the higher band (800-900) would have less, because pp-III contributed to that.

Wait, but wait. Are the neutrinos from the pp-III branch in the higher energy bands? Yes. So if pp-III stops, the flux in higher bands (like 800-900 keV) would decrease. But the lower band (700-800) would still have contributions from other sources, perhaps.

Wait, what are the other sources? The main pp-I produces lower energy neutrinos, but perhaps there's also the CNO cycle. Do CNO neutrinos have higher energies? Because CNO involves heavier elements, so the reactions might release more energy.

So the CNO cycle's neutrinos are higher energy compared to the pp chain. If pp-III stops, and the CNO is still active, then the higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would still get some neutrinos from CNO.

But wait, the CNO neutrinos are a smaller fraction of the total solar neutrino flux compared to the pp chain. So in the original situation, the higher energy bands (like 800-900) would have a mix of pp-III and CNO. If pp-III stops, then that band would lose some of its flux.

So the question is about the ratio (flux band1)/(flux band2) after pp-III stops.

Band1 is 700-800 keV. Band2 is 800-900 keV.

In the original scenario, before the pp-III stopped:

Band1 would have contributions from pp-I and any higher branches (like pp-II) that fall into that range. Band2 would have contributions from pp-III and possibly CNO.

After pp-III stops, band2 would lose all its pp-III contribution, so only the CNO neutrinos would contribute. But wait, do CNO neutrinos fall into band2?

CNO neutrinos are typically higher energy than the pp chain. The pp neutrinos are up to around 1 MeV, but the CNO neutrinos are higher. Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think about the energy distributions.

The main pp-I neutrinos are around 0.5 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III branches might produce neutrinos around 1-2 MeV, perhaps. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, pp-III could produce around 0.8-1.0 MeV.

Wait, maybe I should look up the typical neutrino energies from each process. But I can't look things up right now, so I have to rely on memory.

I remember that the majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp chain, peaking around 0.5 MeV. The CNO neutrinos are a smaller fraction but have higher energies, maybe around 2-4 MeV or so. So if that's the case, the 800-900 keV band (0.8-0.9 MeV) would get some neutrinos from the pp-III branch, which is perhaps active in that range.

So if pp-III stops, then the flux in band2 (800-900) would drop significantly, because a large part of that flux was from pp-III. But the band1 (700-800) would have contributions mainly from pp-I and possibly pp-II, which are not affected.

So, the original flux ratio: (band1)/(band2) would be something. After pp-III stops, the band2 flux decreases. So the new ratio would be (band1)/(band2_new).

Wait, the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stopped. So what's the ratio now compared to before?

Wait, no, the question is asking for the ratio of the current fluxes. So after the pp-III stopped, band1 is as it was, while band2 is lower.

So let's imagine that without any stoppage, the flux in band2 is mainly from pp-III and perhaps some CNO. But if pp-III stops, band2's flux drops to just CNO.

But wait, if CNO neutrinos are higher than band2 (like >1 MeV), then perhaps band2 wouldn't have any CNO contribution. Alternatively, maybe CNO neutrinos are in higher energy bands beyond 900 keV.

Wait, if the CNO neutrinos are around 2-4 MeV, then in the scenario after pp-III stops, the 800-900 keV band (band2) would have almost nothing, because the pp-III was the main contributor in that range. So the flux in band2 would drop to a very low level, possibly close to zero.

But the band1, 700-800 keV, would still have pp-I and possibly pp-II neutrinos, so its flux would stay roughly the same.

So after stopping, the flux in band1 is similar to before, while the flux in band2 is much lower.

So the ratio (band1)/(band2) would be much higher than before. But what was the original ratio?

In the original scenario, band2 had a significant contribution from pp-III, which is higher energy than band1. So the original flux ratio (F1/F2) would be less than 1, since F2 is larger.

After the pp-III stops, F2 drops. So the new F1/F2 would be higher.

But let me think about the actual numbers. Let's say initially, F1 is X and F2 is Y. Suppose Y is much larger than X, so the initial ratio X/Y is small. But after Y drops to Y', which is much smaller than X.

Wait, for example, suppose F1 is 100, F2 is 500 (so the ratio is 0.2). If pp-III stops and F2 drops to 10, the new ratio is 100/10 = 10.

So the ratio would increase by a factor of 50.

But in reality, what's the initial flux ratio?

If the pp-III was a major contributor to the higher band (band2), then the initial F2 would be much higher than F1. So F1/F2 is small, perhaps around 0.1 or so. After stopping, F2 would drop, making the ratio much larger.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. I'm more confident about the trend that the ratio would increase.

Looking at the options:

A) 10.

B) 0.01 (10^-2).

C) 1.

D) 0.1 (10^-1).

If the answer is A (10), that suggests that F1 is ten times F2. But that would imply that F2 is lower than F1, which I'm not sure is the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which band is higher. Let me think: the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy than the pp-I. So band1 is 700-800 keV, band2 is 800-900. So pp-III might contribute more to band2 than band1.

In the original situation, the majority of neutrinos in band2 would be from pp-III, while band1 might have some from pp-I and possibly some from pp-II if their energies fall into that range.

If pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in band2 would drop significantly, perhaps to almost zero if the CNO neutrinos are above 900 keV.

In that case, band1's flux is still at its original level, and band2's flux is now much lower. So the ratio (band1)/(band2) would be much greater than 1.

Looking at the options, the only option higher than 1 is A) 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are a significant but not dominant part of band2.

Wait, another angle: the pp-III branch produces a specific type of neutrino. The main source for the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range would be from the pp-I and possibly pp-II. The pp-III neutrinos are higher, so the 800-900 band is where pp-III would contribute more.

So if pp-III stops, band2 would have less, but band1 would stay the same.

So the initial F1/F2 = (flux700-800) / (flux800-900) = let's say 1/5 = 0.2.

After pp-III stops, band2's flux is only from CNO if any. But if CNO's neutrinos are higher than 900 keV, then in band2, the flux is zero.

So the new F2 is zero, so the ratio F1/F2 would
