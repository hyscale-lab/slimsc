Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are still happening as usual. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio is flux(band1)/flux(band2), and the options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C) 1, D) 0.1.

Hmm. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. The main pp chain goes through several steps, including the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh wait, right, the pp-I branch is the dominant one, and the others are minor. So if pp-III stops, what does that mean for neutrino production?

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun through the beta decay steps in these fusion processes. The pp-I branch produces a lot of neutrinos, I think, but the pp-III branch is a different pathway. Wait, what happens in the pp-III branch? Let me recall. The pp-III branch involves the fusion of a proton with a helium-3 nucleus, right? So the reaction is p + He-3 → C-12 + a neutrino. Oh yeah, that's one of the steps. But wait, wait—no, I think the pp-III branch starts with He-3 fusing with He-3 to make C-12, but I'm a bit hazy on the exact steps. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a specific part of the chain where a proton captures onto a carbon-13, leading to nitrogen-14 emitting a neutrino. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again.

The primary pp chain is pp-I, where two protons fuse to form deuterium, then another proton adds to make tritium, which decays via beta decay to helium-3 and emits a neutrino. Then, that He-3 can combine in various ways—either two He-3 fusing to make C-12 (which is the pp-III branch), or a He-3 fusing with a He-4 to make two He-4 and a photon, that's the pp-II branch maybe.

Wait, maybe the pp-II branch is where the He-3 captures a proton to form C-13, which then undergoes beta decay to N-13, emitting a neutrino. Then N-13 captures a proton to become O-16 and emits another neutrino. So each of these steps produces neutrinos.

So the pp-I branch emits neutrinos at a certain energy, but the pp-II and pp-III branches emit neutrinos at different energies. But wait, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping. So if the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected?

Wait, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch must be at a certain energy. Oh, right, the neutrinos from the main pp chain (pp-I) are around 0.5 MeV or so. But the higher energy neutrinos come from other branches. Oh, wait, the pp-III branch might produce higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop more than the lower ones.

But the question is about the ratio between two specific bands: 700-800 keV (band1) and 800-900 keV (band2). So after the pp-III branch stops, how does that affect the flux in these bands?

Wait, when the pp-III branch is active, it produces neutrinos in certain energy ranges. If it stops, the flux from that part would drop, but the rest of the reactions
