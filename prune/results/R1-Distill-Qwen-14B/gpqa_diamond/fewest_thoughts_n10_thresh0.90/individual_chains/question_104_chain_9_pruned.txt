Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

The question says that astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars with the same mass as the Sun. They found one planet each, both similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets have circular orbits. 

They detected these using the RV method, which I remember stands for radial velocity. The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum because the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is, the bigger the Doppler shift.

So, planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift. Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude K (the maximum velocity) is related to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity due to the orbit.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ (something?)). No, wait, maybe I should look up the formula again.

Wait, the formula I know is K = (v) = [ (G * M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(c)) ), but maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I think the RV method's measured velocity is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P / (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) )^(something). Wait, perhaps a better approach is to relate the velocities to the orbital periods.

Wait, let's think about the Doppler shift. The star's velocity (v) is related to the orbital period. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (like Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So that simplifies to K ≈ ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but in this problem, the two stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like). So M_p1 ≈ M_p2, and M_star1 ≈ M_star2. So the only varying factors are the velocities (K) and the periods (P).

Wait, but the question states that the stars have the same mass, and the planets are similar. So K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). Because looking at the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), since K = [ ... ] * (1/P)^(1/3).

So if K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7 milliangstrom, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3). So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Wait, no, wait. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

We know K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2 =5/7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

We want to find P2/P1. So let's cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3. Let me compute that.

5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So 125/343 = approximately 0.364.

Wait, but wait. The question asks: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So P2 is longer than P1 by a factor of (5/7)^3 ≈0.364. So 0.364 times. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because a larger Doppler shift (K) would mean a shorter period? Because if the star is moving more, the planet is closer, hence shorter period.

Wait, let me think again. If the star's velocity is higher (K is higher), that implies a more massive planet or a closer orbit. So higher K implies shorter period.

So if K2 is larger (7 mA) than K1 (5 mA), then planet #2's period should be shorter than planet #1's.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then the factor is less than 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine the RV semi-amplitude formula.

The correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p)^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 (1 - e^2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / c) * (2π/(P)) )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the Doppler shift and the velocity.

The star's velocity (v) is given by v = (2π a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis. But since the orbit is circular, a is the radius.

But wait, actually, the formula for the star's velocity is v = (2π a_star) / P, where a_star is the star's orbit around the barycenter. Since M_p << M_star, a_star ≈ (M_p/(M_star)) * a. So a_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) a ≈ (M_p/M_star) a.

So v ≈ (2π (M_p/(M_star)) a ) / P.

But using Kepler's third law, (a^3) / (P^2) = G (M_star + M_p) / (4π^2). Again, M_p << M_star, so approx (a^3)/(P^2) ≈ G M_star/(4π^2).

So a^3 = G M_star P^2 / (4 π^2).

Substituting a into the velocity formula:

v ≈ (2π (M_p/(M_star)) * [ (G M_star P^2/(4 π^2) )^(1/3) ]) ) / P.

Simplify this.

Let me compute a in terms of P:

a = [ G M_star (P/(2π))^2 ]^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express velocity in terms of P.

Alternatively, since v = 2π a / P, and from Kepler's law, a^3 = (G M_star P^2)/(4 π^2). Taking cube roots:

a = [(G M_star P^2)/(4 π^2)]^(1/3).

So substituting into v:

v = (2 π /
