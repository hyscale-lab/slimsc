Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered with dark spots. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So, the spots are at 5000 K, right? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000.

The question says that because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness as observed from Earth (or wherever) will vary periodically. But without the spots, another scenario is considered where an exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation. We need to find the radius of such a planet relative to the star's radius.

Wait, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness which we can observe as a light curve. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So the formula for the change in brightness (delta) is delta = (Rp / Rstar)^2, because area scales with the square of the radius.

But in this case, the star's spots are causing a similar effect. So I need to model how the spots affect the observed brightness and then compare that to a planetary transit.

Hmm. So the star has spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. The effective area of the spots is 20% of half the star's surface, right? Because a hemisphere is half the star. Wait, let's think. The total surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So a hemisphere is 2πR². If the filling factor is 20%, then the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no, wait. The problem states that the hemisphere is covered with spots with a filling factor of 20%. I think the filling factor is the fraction of the area covered. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So hemisphere area is 2πR². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Each spot is cooler, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. Since it's only one hemisphere with spots, as the star rotates, the spots will rotate into and out of our field of view.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, "as only one hemisphere is spotty," so when we observe the star, the spots will be on the surface that we can see as the star rotates. So when the star rotates, the spots will come into view and then leave, causing a change in the observed brightness.

The brightness variation due to the spots is similar to the planet transit. So the idea is that the change in brightness caused by the spots (over time) is the same as the change caused by a planet transiting.

But wait, the star's spots are cooler. So when a spot is visible, the star's brightness is less than when it's not. For a planet transit, when the planet covers part of the star, the brightness also decreases.

So the problem is asking, if we have a star without spots, what planet radius would cause the same brightness variation as the spots do when the star has them.

So, let's model the brightness.

First, the star without spots emits a certain amount of flux. The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So the total flux we receive is proportional to the star's area times T_eff^4.

But when there are spots, a fraction of the star's surface emits less flux because the spots are cooler. Let me see. The spot's temperature is 5000 K, and the star's is 6000 K.

So the flux without any spots is F0 = σTeff^4. The flux from the spotted region is F_spot = σ*(T_spot)^4. The area of the spots is A_spot = 0.2 * 2πR² (since the spot is on one hemisphere, which is 2πR² area, and 20% of that is spots).

Wait, no. Wait, the entire surface of the star is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so A_spot = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the total flux from the star without any spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * 4πR².

But when the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (A_spot * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) * (something?) Wait, no. Let me think again.

The total flux from the star would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

So the unspotted area is the total area minus the spotted area. But wait, only one hemisphere is spotty. So, the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one with spots (20% of its area), and the other without spots. But wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, so the spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere (so 0.2 * 2πR²), and the rest is unspotted.

So the total flux when the star is viewed so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us is F_spotty = (Flux from unspotted areas) + (Flux from spotted areas).

Flux from unspotted areas: the unspotted part of the spotty hemisphere plus the entire other hemisphere.

Wait, the star has two hemispheres. One has 20% spots, the other is completely unspotted (as only one hemisphere is spotty). So the unspotted area is the entire other hemisphere (2πR²) plus the unspotted part of the first hemisphere.

Wait, no. The problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the other hemisphere is spot-free.

So the total unspotted area is 2πR² (other hemisphere) + (1 - 0.2) * 2πR² (the unspotted part of the first hemisphere).

So that's 2πR² * (1 + 0.8) = 2πR² * 1.8 = 3.6 π R².

The spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R².

So the total flux from the star when the spotty side is facing us is:

F_spotty = (3.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The star's entire surface emits flux. When we see the spotty hemisphere (i.e., when it's facing us), the flux is the sum of the unspotted parts and the spotted parts
