Okay, I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, let me think. So the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). And the question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2.

Wait, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But how does that relate to the metric? Oh right, the metric describes the geometry of the space. So I should probably figure out what kind of space this metric represents.

Looking at the metric, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That looks a bit like the equation of a sphere. The standard sphere metric has something like (1 - r²/R²) where R is the radius. Wait, no, maybe I should think of the metric in terms of conformal geometry. Because this metric is conformally flat, right? It's a multiple of the flat metric (dx² + dy²) by some function.

So, the metric is conformally Euclidean. The function in front is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). Let me think about the form. If I have a metric like ds² = f(r) (dx² + dy²), where f depends on r² = x² + y², then the Gaussian curvature K can be found using the formula for conformal metrics.

The Gaussian curvature K for a conformal metric ds² = f(r) (dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(2 f)) * Δ(ln f), where Δ is the Laplacian in two dimensions. Alternatively, I might have the formula a bit off, but I remember it's related to the function f and its derivatives.

Wait, another approach: maybe the metric is similar to that of a hyperbolic plane, which has constant negative curvature. The hyperbolic metric in the Poincaré disk model is ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dx² + dy²), where r² = x² + y². So comparing this to our metric, our denominator is (4 - x² - y²) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ), so r² is (x² + y²) and the denominator is 4(1 - r²/4).

So the metric can be written as 32/(4(1 - (x²+y²)/4)) (dx² + dy²) = 8/(1 - (x²+y²)/4) (dx² + dy²). Hmm. So that's 8 * [1/(1 - (r²/4))], where r² = x² + y².

Wait, the standard hyperbolic metric is 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dx² + dy²). So comparing, our function here is 8/(1 - (r²/4)) = 8 * (1 - r²/4)^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature. For the hyperbolic plane, the Gaussian curvature K is -1/(a²), where a is the curvature radius. Alternatively, let's think about the function f(r) = (4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². So f(r) = 4 - r², and the metric is ds² = (32/f(r)) (dx² + dy²) = 32/(4 - r²) (dx² + dy²).

Wait, but in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dx² + dy²), which has curvature K = -1. So our metric is different. Let me compute the curvature.

The formula for the Gaussian curvature K of a conformal metric ds² = e^{2λ} (dx² + dy²) is K = -e^{-2λ} (Δλ), where Δ is the Laplacian. Alternatively, another formula: K = - (1/(2e^{2λ})) (Δ (e^{2λ})).

Wait, maybe a better way is to recall that for a metric ds² = (4/(a² - r²)) (dx² + dy²), where a is the radius, the Gaussian curvature is K = 1/(a²). Wait, no, no. Wait, the Poincaré disk model has ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dx² + dy²) and Gaussian curvature K = -1. So our metric is 32/(4 - r²) (dx² + dy²), which is 8/(1 - (r²/4)) (dx² + dy²) = 8 * (1/(1 - (r²/4)) ) (dx² + dy²).

Hmm, so let me factor out the denominator. Let me write the denominator as (4 - r²) = 4(1 - (r²/4)). So the metric becomes (32)/(4(1 - (r²/4))) ) (dx² + dy²) = (8)/(1 - (r²/4)) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, so it's like 8/(1 - (r²/4)) times dx² + dy².

Wait, comparing to the Poincaré disk model: the model's metric is 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dx² + dy²) = (2/(1 - r²))^2 (dx² + dy²). So our metric is 8/(1 - (r²/4)) = 8 * [1/(1 - (r²/4)) ].

Wait, so perhaps I can write it as [something]^2 * (dx² + dy²), so let me see: 8/(1 - (r²/4)) = [sqrt(8) / (1 - (r²/4))^{1/2}]^2? Not sure if that helps, but perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature K of the given metric. Since the metric is conformally Euclidean, the Gaussian curvature can be computed using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 f)) * (d² ln f) 

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is:

K = - (1/(2 f)) * [ ( (∂² ln f)/(∂x²) + (∂² ln f)/(∂y²) ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it using the standard formula for the Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates. The formula is:

K = - (1/(2 f)) * ( ∂² ln f / ∂x² + ∂² ln f / ∂y² )

Alternatively, another approach: the Gaussian curvature for a metric ds² = A(r)² (dx² + dy²) is K = - (1/(2 A²)) * d/d r ( (A')/A ) * 2r. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Let me think.

Wait, r = sqrt(x² + y²). So if A(r) is a function that depends on r, then the Gaussian curvature can be found as:

K = - (1/(2 A²)) * [ (d(A²)/dr) / r ]

Wait, perhaps better to compute it using the Lagrange formula. The formula is K = - (1/(2 A²)) [ (A')² / r - A A'' ] where A is the conformal factor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me let f(r) = 32/(4 - r²), since r² = x² + y². So f(r) = 32/(4 - r²). Then, the metric is ds² = f(r) (dx² + dy²).

The Gaussian curvature K for a conformal metric is given by:

K = - (1/(2 f)) [ ( (df/dr) )^2 / (2 r) ) - (d²f/dr²) / f ]

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should compute it directly using the formula K = - (1/(2 f)) * (Δ (ln f)) ), where Δ is the Laplacian.

Wait, because the metric is conformally flat, the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2 f)) * (Δ (ln f)) ), where Δ is the 2D Laplacian.

So let's compute ln f(r) first. ln f(r) = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

The Laplacian in 2D for a function that depends only on r is Δ (ln f(r)) = (1/r) d/dr ( r d/dr (ln f(r)) ) ).

Wait, ln f(r) = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

Compute d/dr (ln f(r)) = d/dr [ - ln(4 - r²) ] = (2r)/(4 - r²).

Then, d/dr [ r * (2r)/(4 - r²) ] = d/dr [ (2 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ].

Let me compute this derivative:

Let’s let u = 2 r², v = 4 - r².

So the derivative is (u’ v - u v’) / v².

u’ = 4 r, v’ = - 2 r.

So derivative is [4 r (4 - r²) - (2 r²)(-2 r)] / (4 - r²)^2.

Simplify numerator: 4 r (4 - r²) + 4 r^3 = 16 r -4 r^3 +4 r^3 = 16 r.

So the derivative is (16 r) / (4 - r²)^2.

So the Laplacian Δ(ln f(r)) is (1/r) * (16 r) / (4 - r²)^2 )= 16/(4 - r²)^2.

So, K = - (1/(2 f(r))) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 )

But f(r) = 32/(4 - r²). So 1/(2 f(r)) = (4 - r²)/(64).

Putting it together: K = (4 - r²)/(64) * 16/(4 - r²)^2 ) = (16 (4 - r²)) / (64 (4 - r²)^2 ) )

Simplify: (16) / (64 (4 - r²) )) = 1/(4 (4 - r²)).

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the Gaussian curvature should be a constant for a pseudosphere. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the Laplacian part. So ln f(r) = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

Then, d/dr ln f(r) = (2 r)/(4 - r²).

Multiply by r: r * (2 r)/(4 - r²) = 2 r²/(4 - r²).

Then, take derivative of that with respect to r:

d/dr (2 r²/(4 - r²)) = [ (4 r (4 - r²)) + 2 r² (2 r) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Let’s use the quotient rule: derivative of (2r²)/(4
