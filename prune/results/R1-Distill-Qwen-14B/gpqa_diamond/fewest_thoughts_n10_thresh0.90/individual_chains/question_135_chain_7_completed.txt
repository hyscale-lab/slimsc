Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The mass of X is 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure how that plays into the decay options. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay products.

Hmm, I remember that when a particle decays, the total energy has to be enough to produce the rest masses of the decay products. So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of each particle in the decay products. Because in a decay, the energy must be enough to create the rest mass of both particles (since they're produced as a pair, like fermions).

First, I should list the masses of the possible fermions. Since X is a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The options include particles like b quarks, c quarks, s quarks, u quarks, top quarks, tau leptons, muons, electrons, etc.

Wait, what are the masses of these particles? Let me think.

Electron (e⁻): about 0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ⁻): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ⁻): ~1.78 GeV
Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (but sometimes approximated as 2 MeV)
Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV (around 4 MeV)
Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV (about 95 MeV)
Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
Bottom quark (b): ~4.1 GeV
Top quark (t): way heavier, like ~173 GeV, but wait, X is 6 GeV, so t is way too heavy.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays into a pair of particles, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Since each particle in the pair has to be at least half of 6 GeV, so 3 GeV each.

Wait, wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when a particle at rest decays, the total energy available is its rest mass. The decay products have to have their rest mass energies, plus any kinetic energy. So the condition is that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

But for each pair, each particle must have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because each would get half the energy in the center of mass frame, but wait, no, that's not the case. The correct condition is that 2m ≤ M, where M is the mass of the decaying particle, and m is the mass of each particle in the pair. Because each fermion in the pair has mass m, so 2m must be ≤ M. So for each possible fermion, check if 2m ≤ 6 GeV.

So let's go through each possible option.

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Check each pair:

b quark: m=4.1 GeV. 2m=8.2 GeV. Which is larger than 6 GeV. So this decay isn't allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Check each:

c quark: m=1.27 GeV. 2m=2.54 GeV ≤6. So allowed.

s: 0.095*2=0.19 ≤6.

u: 0.003*2=0.006 ≤6.

d: 0.004*2=0.008 ≤6.

tau: 1.78*2=3.56 ≤6. So allowed.

mu: 0.105*2=0.21 ≤6.

e: 0.0005*2=0.001 ≤6.

So all the pairs in option B are allowed, except for b, which is not included here. So B is a possibility.

Option C: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, top quark mass is ~173 GeV, so 2m would be 346 GeV, which is way bigger than 6 GeV. So t tbar would require X to be at least 346 GeV, but X is only 6 GeV. So this decay is impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, check each pair.

b quark: 4.1*2=8.2>6, so b decay not allowed, so D is incorrect.

So only option B is correct, as all its pairs have 2m ≤6 GeV.

Wait, but wait another thing. What about the interaction term? The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should think about what particles the boson X can interact with.

Wait, the Lagrangian has a term λ f ψ_f X ψ_f. So it's a Yukawa-like coupling. The fermion fields ψ_f are in the interaction term, so which fermions f can X couple to? Because only then can X decay into those fermions.

Wait, the fermions ψ_f could be any, but perhaps the question is just about what's kinematically allowed, regardless of the interaction. But sometimes, even if kinematically allowed, the decay isn't possible if the interaction doesn't allow it.

Wait, but the question is about kinematically allowed decays, so maybe the interaction isn't a factor here. Because the question is asking about what's allowed kinematically, not whether the interaction term allows it.

Wait, the question says, "What are the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order?"

Ah, right, so kinematics is about energy and mass, not about the interaction. So the interaction only determines possible couplings, but for kinematics, it's about whether the energy is sufficient.

But wait, the interaction term here is a Yukawa coupling. The term is L = -λ f ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps the fermion field ψ_f is the same in both terms, so it's a Yukawa coupling where X couples to a fermion f. So X can decay into f and f-bar only if the interaction allows it. So perhaps only the fermions that are in the Lagrangian can be decay products.

Wait, but the problem statement says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, but the options include various fermions. So perhaps all the fermions in the options are those that X can interact with, hence decay into. But wait, the options include all the particles in the Standard Model, but perhaps the coupling λ is such that it's non-zero only for certain fermions.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions are coupled. It just says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So perhaps the Lagrangian can have any fermions ψ_f, but perhaps the question is assuming that all fermions are possible, so we just look for kinematic limits.

Wait, but the problem as stated is about the kinematically allowed decays, regardless of whether the interaction term allows it. Because the question is about what's allowed kinematically, not whether the interaction exists.

Wait, but in reality, the decay would only happen if the interaction exists. But the question is about kinematics, so perhaps we only consider the mass.

But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the interaction is possible for any fermion, so any fermion with 2m ≤ M can be a decay product.

So the only thing to check is whether each fermion's mass allows the decay.

Going back, option B includes c quarks, which have 2m=2.54 GeV ≤6. So c is allowed.

Option C includes top quarks, which are not allowed, so C is wrong.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), we analyze the possible decay products based on the condition that the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). For a fermion-antifermion pair \( f\bar{f} \), the condition is \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \).
