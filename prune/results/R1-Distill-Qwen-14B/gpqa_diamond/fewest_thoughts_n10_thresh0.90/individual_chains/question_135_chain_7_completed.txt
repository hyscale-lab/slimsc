Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the decay of a boson X, right? Let me see what I remember.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that better. Oh, I think the interaction is between the boson field X and some fermion fields. The fermions in the interaction would be the ones with mass m_f, I suppose.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I remember that when a particle decays, the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. Because energy and momentum conservation, right? So for X to decay into two particles, each must be less than half of X's mass. Wait, no, wait. Because if X is at rest and decays into two particles, each particle's energy would be (m_X + m_product)/2 or something like that. Wait, actually, the condition is that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than m_X. Because each must have energy less than m_X/2 plus any kinetic energy, but I think the key point is that each product's mass must be less than m_X. Oh wait no, wait. For a decay into two particles, each must have a mass such that 2m < m_X, but that's only if they are the same particles. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. For a decay into a pair of particles like a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of each must be less than m_X/2. Because if each is m, then the total rest mass would be 2m. So 2m < m_X => m < m_X/2. So for X boson, m_X=6 GeV, each fermion must have mass less than 3 GeV. So which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV?

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV, so way less than 3 GeV. The strange quark is a bit heavier, like about 100 MeV or so. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, I think. The bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV. The top quark is way heavier, like 173 GeV. The electron is about 0.0005 GeV, so negligible. Muon is about 0.1 GeV. Tau is about 1.77 GeV. So, let's list the fermions and their masses:

- e: ~0.0005 GeV
- mu: ~0.1 GeV
- tau: ~1.77 GeV
- u: ~2-5 MeV
- d: ~3-7 MeV
- s: ~95-110 MeV
- c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- b: ~4.1-5 GeV (wait, I thought it was around 4.5, but perhaps some sources say higher, but let me check in my mind)
- t: ~173 GeV

So, the X boson has a mass of 6 GeV. So any fermion pair it decays into must have each fermion mass less than 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by two is 3 GeV.

Wait, but the fermion pair must each have mass less than 3 GeV because each would have a mass m, and 2m <6 GeV. So m <3 GeV.

So which fermions are lighter than 3 GeV? Let's go through each fermion:

e: 0.0005 GeV → yes
mu: 0.1 GeV → yes
tau: 1.77 GeV → yes (since 1.77 <3)
u: 2-5 MeV → yes
d: 3-7 MeV → yes, 7 MeV is 0.007 GeV, which is less than 3
s: 100 MeV → 0.1 GeV, yes
c: 1.2-1.5 GeV → yes
b: 4.5 GeV → wait, 4.5 is greater than 3 GeV. So for b quark, 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3. So cannot decay into b and anti-b because each would require 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3. So X cannot decay into b b-bar.

Wait, but wait. If the X is 6 GeV, and the b quark is about 4.5 GeV, then 4.5 * 2 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So for X to decay into b and anti-b, the sum would be 4.5 +4.5 =9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So that's not allowed kinematically. So decay into b quarks is not allowed. So the decay channel X→b b-bar is not allowed.

Similarly, the top quark is way too heavy, but the top isn't an option in the choices, I think.

So looking at the options, the allowed fermions are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but what about the charm quark? 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3. So X can decay into c c-bar, because 2 *1.5=3 GeV, which is equal to half of X's mass. Wait wait, no, wait. Let me think again: the maximum mass a fermion can have for X → f f-bar is m_f ≤ m_X /2.

Because, X is at rest, and the two fermions fly off in opposite directions. Each gets some energy, but their rest mass must be less than m_X /2.

So m_f must be less than m_X /2. So for X=6 GeV, each fermion must be less than 3 GeV.

So for c quark, at 1.5 GeV, that's okay. So X can decay into c c-bar.

But what about the b quark? At 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so it's not allowed.

So the possible decay products are fermion pairs where each fermion has a mass less than 3 GeV.

Looking back at the fermion masses:

e (0.0005 GeV) → allowed
mu (0.1 GeV) → allowed
tau (1.77 GeV) → allowed
u (2-5 MeV) → allowed
d (3-7 MeV) → allowed
s (~100 MeV) → allowed
c (~1.5 GeV) → allowed
b (4.5 GeV) → not allowed
t (173 GeV) → not allowed

So the possible fermion pairs are all except the b and t quarks.

Wait, but the options given in the problem are:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

So, from our analysis, the allowed decay channels are those where the fermion pair has m_f <3 GeV. So decay into b quarks is not allowed.

Now looking at the options:

Option A includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So A is not correct.

Option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. So all of these are allowed.

Option C includes t tbar, which is not allowed (since m_t is way larger than 3 GeV), so option C is incorrect.

Option D includes b bbar, which is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option would be B.

Wait, but wait. What about the tau in option B? Tau is about 1.77 GeV, which is less than 3, so allowed.

Also, what about the muon? 0.1 GeV, allowed.

So in option B, all the decay channels are allowed.

Wait, but wait. Does the interaction Lagrangian affect which fermions can be decay products? The interaction is given by L(y) = -λf ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)).

Wait, perhaps the fermion fields ψ_f are the ones that interact. So the interaction is for each fermion species f, so X can decay into any of the fermion species that are present in the Lagrangian.

Wait, but the question is about kinematical allowability, not whether the interaction exists.

So regardless of whether the Lagrangian includes a specific fermion, the kinematics depend on whether the fermion's mass is below m_X/2.

Wait, but maybe the Lagrangian only includes certain fermions. Let me look again.

The interaction is given as: -λf ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)).

Wait, perhaps this is a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be something like -λ X ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y), but perhaps the exact form is not as important as the fact that X couples to all fermions f.

But the problem doesn't specify which fermions are in the theory. So I think we have to assume that X can decay into any of the available fermions, as long as their mass allows it.

So, given that, the kinematically allowed decays would be all fermion pairs where each m_f < 3 GeV.

So that includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So looking at the options:

Option B lists c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

So all these are allowed.

Wait, but what about the top quark? It's not present in the options, so probably not required.

So from the options, the correct one is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but the focus is on kinematic constraints, which depend on the masses of the decay products. For \( X \) to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of each fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( m_f < m_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the total rest mass of the decay products is less than the mass of \( X \).

The known fermion masses are as follows:
- \( e \): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( u \): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( d \): \( \sim 3-7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( s \): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( c \): \( \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, \) and \( c \). Therefore, the allowed decay channels for \( X \) are \( X \to e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, \) and \( c \bar{c} \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \) and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \).

Answer: B
