Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options given are four different organic compounds. I need to match the spectral data with the structure.

First, the FTIR part: There's a very broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around 3000 is usually due to O-H stretching. Wait, but wait—no, wait. Wait, O-H is typically around 3200-3600. If it's a very broad peak, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Oh, wait, wait. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because they're strong hydrogen bond formers. The peak here at 3000 seems a bit lower than typical. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but that's less likely because the O-H is usually higher. Wait, another thought: maybe it's an amine? No, because the question doesn't mention any amine. Wait, but the options all include a COOH group. So the peak at 3000 is probably the O-H from the carboxylic acid. Because the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually broad and around 2500-3300. But 3000 is a bit on the lower side, but possible. And then the peak at 1700 is a strong absorption, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or ester. But in this case, given the options, the carbonyl is likely from the COOH group, which usually has a peak around 1700, but maybe a little lower. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H and C=O. So that makes sense.

So the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds, or if there are, they don't have hydrogens adjacent (like in a benzene ring, but that's not suggested here). So the compound is probably fully saturated.

The NMR has several signals. Two of them have complex splitting: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. That's a bit tricky. Let's think about splitting patterns.

Each splitting indicates the number of neighboring protons. For example, a doublet means each proton has one neighboring set (n+1 rule). A triplet would be two neighboring protons. So a doublet of triplets would imply that each proton is next to two different sets of protons. Let's think about possible structures.

Looking at the options, all of them have a similar structure. Let me write them down:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

Wait, maybe I should look at the structures more clearly. Let me draw each one.

Option A: The skeleton is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the middle two carbons each have a CH group with two ethyl groups attached. So the structure is something like CH3-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH. So the -COOH is directly attached to the second CH(Et) group.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the middle two are CH(CH3) groups, each attached to two methyl groups. So the structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So structure is CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The COOH is directly attached to the second CH(CH3).

Wait, but all these have a COOH group, possibly as a terminal group. So in the NMR, the protons near the COOH would be deshielded, but that's more about chemical shift than splitting.

Now, the NMR has some complex splitting. Let's think about each option's structure and what splitting their protons would show.

Looking for a doublet of triplets of quartets. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of vicinal coupling, where a proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons.

Let me take each option and imagine their NMR.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

The structure is:

CH3-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH.

So each CH(Et) group is connected to the next.

The protons on the CH(Et) groups will be split based on their neighboring groups. Let's think about the middle CH(Et) groups. Each is connected to the other CH(Et) group and to the CH3 or CH2CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the substituents on each carbon.

Wait, the first CH(Et) is connected to CH3 on one side and CH(Et) on the other. So the protons on the first CH(Et) are next to the CH3 and the middle CH(Et).

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible coupling in each structure.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH2CH3-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH.

The protons on the CH(Et) groups are adjacent to each other, so each will couple with the other. Additionally, each CH(Et) is attached to an ethyl group, which has three protons on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but the ethyl groups (C2H5) are attached to the central CH groups. So each CH(Et) has two ethyl groups attached. Wait, no—each CH(Et) is CH attached to one Et group? Or each CH(Et) is attached to two Et groups? Wait, the formula for option B is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So each of the two middle CH groups has one C2H5 substituent. So each CH has one ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps each CH(Et) is connected to one ethyl group and the adjacent CH(Et) group.

So the structure would be:

CH2CH3 - CH(Et) - CH(Et) - COOH.
