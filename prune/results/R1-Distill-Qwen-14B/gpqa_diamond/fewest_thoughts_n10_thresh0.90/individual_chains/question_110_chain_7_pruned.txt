Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The question is about which stars can be observed by both spectrographs. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect stars with certain apparent magnitudes. So, the key here is to find out the apparent V magnitude of each star because each instrument has a different limit.

I remember that apparent magnitude is how bright a star appears from Earth. The lower (more negative) the magnitude, the brighter the star. But wait, no—wait, no, higher magnitudes mean dimmer objects. So, a magnitude of 17 is dimmer than 16, right?

Looking at the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag. Wait, does that mean stars with V magnitude less than or equal to 17? Or brighter than 17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, its magnitude would be less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤ 17. Similarly, HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag ≤ 16.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read again: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, if a star is brighter, its magnitude is lower. So if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that would mean stars with V mag less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V mag less than 16.

Wait, no, wait. Because apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star that's brighter than 17 would have a magnitude less than 17. So for a star to be detectable, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤ the limit. So ESPRESSO detects stars with V ≤17, HIRES with V ≤16.

So, each star must have apparent V magnitude ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO and ≤16 to
