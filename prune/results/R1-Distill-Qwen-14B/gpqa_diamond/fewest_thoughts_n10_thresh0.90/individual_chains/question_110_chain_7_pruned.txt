Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. I think ESPRESSO is on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal, Chile, and HIRES is on the Keck Telescope in Hawaii. Both are used for things like radial velocity measurements, which helps in finding exoplanets.

The question gives me some data about each star, and I need to figure out which ones are bright enough to be observed by both instruments. The key point is their apparent magnitude. Oh wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can observe brighter than 16 V mag. So, the star must have an apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16 (since brighter is lower magnitude) for HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is <=17 for ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so apparent mag <=16.

Wait, no, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because, for example, a 5th magnitude star is brighter than a 15th. So the limit is: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag <=17, and HIRES can observe V mag <=16. Because anything brighter (i.e., magnitude smaller) than those limits can be seen.

So the star must have an apparent V magnitude <=16 to be seen by HIRES, and <=17 to be seen by ESPRESSO. So in order to be detectable by both, the apparent V mag must be <=16. Because if it's <=16, then
