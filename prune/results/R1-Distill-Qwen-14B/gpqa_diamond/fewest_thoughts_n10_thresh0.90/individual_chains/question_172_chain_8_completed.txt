Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let's break it down. So, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles, like electrons or atoms, follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution. So the population of different energy levels is determined by temperature. 

The formula for the Boltzmann distribution is something like (n_i) / (n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Oh right, because higher energy levels have fewer particles unless the temperature is high enough. 

In this case, the energy difference is given, E. So let's think. Star_1 has twice as many atoms in a higher energy level compared to star_2. Wait, no, wait. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Oh wait, I should clarify: does that mean that the number of atoms in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 relative to star_2 for the same energy level?

So, if we denote the number of excited atoms as n1 for star_1 and n2 for star_2, then n1 = 2*n2.

But according to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations depends on the energy levels and temperature. Since the energy difference is the same for both stars (same energy levels), the ratio n1/n2 would be exp( -(E)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(E)/(k T2) ) ?

Wait no, wait. Let me get this right. Let me think. Let's say the energy levels in question are level 1 (excited) and level 2 (ground). So the ratio for each star would be n1/n2 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). But wait, E2 is higher than E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. Wait, actually, E is given as the energy difference between the considered levels. So E = E_high - E_low. So for star_1, the ratio n_high/n_low is proportional to exp( -E/(k T1) ). Similarly for star_2, it's exp( -E/(k T2) ). 

Wait, but the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So n_high1 / n_low1 = 2 * (n_high2 / n_low2) ?

Wait, no. The problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." I'm not sure if that's the same level or a different one. Wait, the energy difference is given, so I think we're looking at the same transition for both stars. So the same E.

So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or lower state) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, n1 = (n_low1) * exp( -E/(k T1) ). Similarly, for star_2, n2 = (n_low2) * exp( -E/(k T2) ). 

Wait, but I'm not sure about the setup. Let me think again. The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So n_high1 / n_low1 = 2 * (n_high2 /n_low2). Because in star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2.

So the ratio (n_high1 / n_low1) = 2 * (n_high2 /n_low2).

But according to the Boltzmann distribution, n_high/n_low = exp( -E/(k T) ). So for star_1, n_high1/n_low1 = exp( -E/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's exp( -E/(k T2) ). 

Putting this together: exp( -E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -E/(k T2) ). 

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2. So:

exp( -E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -E/(k T2) )

But wait, if E is the same for both, then taking the ratio:

exp( -(E/(k T1)) ) = 2 * exp( -(E/(k T2)) )

Hmm, maybe I should take the ratio of the two equations. Let me think. Let me denote R1 = n_high1/n_low1 = exp(-E/(k T1)), and R2 = n_high2/n_low2 = exp(-E/(k T2)). 

Given that R1 = 2 * R2.

So R1 / R2 = 2.

Substituting R1 and R2,

[ exp(-E/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-E/(k T2)) ] = 2.

Which becomes exp[ E/(k T2) - E/(k T1) ] = 2.

Because when you divide exponents, you subtract. So that's exp( E [ (1/(k T2) ) - (1/(k T1)) ] ) = 2.

Wait, no: let me compute the exponent correctly. 

E/(k T2) is positive because all terms are positive. E/(k T1) is also positive. So when you subtract, it's E/(k T2) - E/(k T1) = E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So,

exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking natural logs on both sides:

E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

But E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the question doesn't give the value of E because in the options, E is not present. So perhaps the options are written in terms of T1 and T2.

So let me rearrange the equation:

E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

But I can write this as E/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting,

E/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but I don't see E in the options. So perhaps the question is designed so that E/(k) is a known factor. Let me compute E/(k):

E=1.38e-23 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, wait, that's interesting. Because 1.38e-23 J is the same as k's value in J/K multiplied by some temperature. So wait, E = 1.38e-23 J. Let's see: k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So E = k * T where T is 1 K. So E = k * T => T = E/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= 1 K.

So E/(k) = T=1 K.

Wait, really? So E/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back into our equation:

(1 K) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 ) / (1 K )

But since the units are in K, and the right side is unitless? Wait, no, ln(2) is unitless, and 1 K is a unit. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, E is given as 1.38e-23 J. So E = k * T, where k is Boltzmann's constant. So solving for E/k = T. As I said, E is 1.38e-23 J, which is k * (1 K), so E/k = 1 K. So yes, E/(k) = 1 K. 

So substituting back,

1 K * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2 ) / (1 K )

Wait, but that leaves the equation as (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2) / (1 K), but K is a unit. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to reorganize the equation without substituting E/(k) right away.

Wait, the equation is:

E/(k) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But E/(k) is 1 K, so:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, but that would mean that (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/ (1 K )

But that introduces units into the equation, which may complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed in such a way that E/(k) equals 1, so the equation simplifies to (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) )= ln(2 )

Wait, but that's a unit issue. Because E is in J, and k is J/K, so E/k is K. So E/(k) is 1 K. So the equation:

(1 K) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But the left side is in K, the right is unitless. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the substitution.

Wait, let me go back. The original equation after taking natural logs was:

E/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2 )

Which is the same as:

E/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but let me compute E/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= 1 K.

So substituting,

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But that's 1 K multiplied by (something). So the left side has units of K, and the right is unitless. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should not have E/(k) in the equation. Let me think again.

Let me re-derive.

The ratio of the populations is given by:

n_high1 / n_low1 = exp( -E/(k T1) )

Similarly,

n_high2 / n_low2 = exp( -E/(k T2) )

But according to the problem statement, n_high1 / n_low1 = 2 * (n_high2 / n_low2 )

So,

exp( -E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -E/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -E/(k T2) ):

exp( -E/(k T1) + E/(k T2) ) = 2

Which is,

exp( E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2

Taking natural log of both sides,

E/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2 )

But 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

E/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

But, as E/(k) is 1 K, the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 ) / (1 K )

Wait, but the units don't match. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, E/(k) has units of K, right? Because E is J, and k is J/K, so E/k is K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = (ln(2 )) / (E/k )

Wait, no, because E/(k) is 1 K. So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 ) / (1 K )

But that can't be correct because the left side is unitless (since (T1-T2) is in K and denominator is (K^2), so (K)/(K^2)=1/K. Hmm, wait no, wait, let me check the units:

(T1 - T2) is in K, denominator is T1*T2, which is K^2. So (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) is (K)/(K^2) )= 1/K. So the left side has units of 1/K. The right side is ln(2)/ (1 K ) which is same as 1/K. So the units do match. So that's okay.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / (E/(k) )

But E/(k) is 1 K, so,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / (1 K ) * (K )

Wait, because E/(k) is 1 K. Let me think again. The equation after substitution is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / (E/(k) )

Wait, but E/(k) is 1 K, so,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) * (k/E )

Because 1/(E/(k)) = k/E.

But E is k, so E = k * 1 K, so E/k = 1 K. So k/E = 1/(1 K) * K/(J) ? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on units here. Let me instead express the equation without units for the sake of matching the options.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2 ) * (k )/(E )

Because,

E/(k) = 1 K,

so,

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2 ) * (k )/(E )

But since E =k, k/E = 1. So,

(T1-T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

So,

ln(2 ) = (T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

Which can be rewritten as,

ln(2 ) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is ln(2 )= (T1 - T2 )/(T1 T2 )

That's exactly what we have here. So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves two stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), where the number of iron atoms in a specific excited energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

In LTE, the distribution of atoms across energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( n_{\text{high}} \) and \( n_{\text{low}} \) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \( E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to ground state populations are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high,1}}}{n_{\text{low,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{high,2}}}{n_{\text{low,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \( \frac{n_{\text{high,1}}}{n_{\text{low,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{high,2}}}{n_{\text{low,2}}} \). Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \frac{E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K} \) (since \( E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
