--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a meson resonance named X. The problem asks for the mean decay distance. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters. 

Hmm, I remember that when particles are produced, they can decay after traveling some distance before they break down. The mean decay distance probably has to do with how long the particle lives on average and how fast it's moving. 

Wait, right, the mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. The width Γ is the total decay rate. I think the relation is Γ = ħ/τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. Oh wait, no, wait. Γ is the decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ * τ, but actually, I might have that backward. Let me think: the uncertainty principle. The product of the energy uncertainty (Γ) and the time uncertainty (τ) should be on the order of ħ, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. 

But wait, actually, the exact formula for the mean lifetime τ is τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that sounds right. So knowing Γ, I can find τ. Then, the mean decay distance would be the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. So the formula would be L = v * τ. 

But wait, I also need to find the velocity of the meson. For that, I can use the energy and mass to find the velocity. The particle is produced with energy E_X, so its total energy is E = γ m c², where m is the rest mass. 

Wait, but the units here are in GeV. I might have to convert them into standard units. Let me get the constants right. ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and ħ is h/(2π), so around 1.055e-34 J·s, but when working in GeV units, it's often expressed as about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. 

So, first, let's compute the mean lifetime τ. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, wait, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. 

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, so τ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. 

Wait, let me do that division properly. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s. 

Next, I need the velocity of the meson. Since the meson has a production energy E_X of 8 GeV, and its rest mass is 1.2 GeV, I can compute its gamma factor. 

The total energy E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²). But wait, when using units where c is 1 (like in particle physics), E (in GeV) is γ m (in GeV/c²) * c². So GeV is GeV, so E = γ m. So γ = E / m. 

So γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. 

Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so to find v, we can rearrange. Let me compute beta (β = v/c). 

We have γ = 6.6667, so γ² = (1 - β²)^-1. So 1 - β² = 1 / (γ²). 

β² = 1 - (1 / γ²) = 1 - (1 / (44.444...)) ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. 

Wait, wait. Let me compute that more accurately. γ is 8/1.2 = 6.666666..., so γ squared is (6.666666...)^2 = 44.444444... So 1/(γ²) is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So β² is 0.9775, so β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let me compute that. 

The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c. 

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute it more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I can express it as beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) )? Wait, no, E is the total energy, so E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So beta is (pc)/(E). Hmm, maybe another approach. 

Alternatively, the velocity can be found using the relation:

v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4) / (E²)) )

Wait, but I'm working in units where c is 1, so E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c². Hmm, maybe it's easier to remember that for high-energy particles, beta is approximately sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2). 

So, yes, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) ). Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, (m/E)^2 is (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775, so beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v is about 0.9887 c. 

So v ≈ 0.9887 * c. Now, c is about 3e8 meters per second. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s. 

Now, the mean decay distance L is v multiplied by the mean lifetime τ. 

So L = v * τ. 

We have τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. 

So L ≈ 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ let's compute that. 

Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24. 

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 10^(8-24) 

Calculate 2.966 * 2.056875. Let's compute that:

2.966 * 2 is 5.932. 

2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1687 (since 2.966 * 0.05 is 0.1483, 2.966 * 0.006875 ≈ approx 0.0204, so total around 0.1687).

So total approx 5.932 + 0.1687 ≈ 6.1007. 

So 6.1007e-16 meters. 

Wait, wait, 10^(8-24) is 10^-16. So L ≈ 6.1e-16 m. 

But looking at the options, the options are about 5e-15 and 4e-16 etc. Hmm, none of the options are near 6e-16. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me check the calculations again. Maybe I messed up a step.

Wait, the decay width Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Correct. So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s. That seems right.

Gamma is E/m = 8/1.2 = 6.666667, correct. Beta squared is 1 - (1.2/8)^2 = 1 - (0.15)^2 = 0.9775. Beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v = 0.9887 c ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. Correct.

Then, L = v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = approx 6.1e-16 m. 

But wait the options don't have 6e-16. Let me see the options again: options are A) 5.02e-16, B)4.06e-15, C)5.02e-15, D)4.06e-16. 

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 6e-16, which isn't an option. So maybe I made an error in the calculation of v or tau.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in calculating beta. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately. Let's see, 0.9775 is between 0.98^2=0.9604 and 0.99^2=0.9801. Oh wait, wait, 0.9775 is less than 0.9801, so sqrt(0.9775) is approx 0.98869... Let me compute it more accurately.

Use a better approximation for sqrt(0.9775). Let me think: 0.99^2=0.9801, which is higher than 0.9775. So 0.99^2 = 0.9801. 0.98^2 = 0.9604. So 0.9875^2? Let's see:

0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144.

Hmm, 0.988^2 = 0.976144. 0.976144 is less than 0.9775, so we're looking for a number a bit higher than 0.988.

Let me compute 0.9885^2.

0.9885^2 = (0.988 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2.

We know 0.988^2 is 0.976144.

2*0.988*0.0005 = 0.000988.

0.0005^2=0.00000025.

Adding up: 0.976144 + 0.000988 = 0.977132, plus 0.00000025 is 0.97713225.

That's still less than 0.9775. So 0.9885^2 = 0.97713225.

We need 0.9775, which is 0.9775-0.97713225 = 0.00036775 higher.

The next step: let's find how much more beyond 0.9885 is needed.

Let me denote delta as the small increment beyond 0.9885.

We have (0.9885 + delta)^2 ≈ 0.9885^2 + 2*0.9885*delta.

We need this to be 0.9775. So:

0.97713225 + 2*(0.9885)*delta = 0.9775.

Subtract: 2*0.9885 * delta ≈ 0.9775 - 0.97713225 = 0.00036775.

So delta ≈ 0.00036775 / (2 * 0.9885) ≈ 0.00036775 / 1.977 ≈ approximately 0.0001863.

So delta is about 0.0001863. So beta is approximately 0.9885 + 0.0001863 ≈ 0.988686. So beta ≈ 0.988686.

So v ≈ 0.988686 * c ≈ 0.988686 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. Wait, same as before. So my earlier approximation was correct; perhaps the beta is about 0.9887, so the velocity is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the lifetime tau?

Wait, tau is ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = let's compute that more accurately.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4. So 6.582 - 6.4 = 0.182. So 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875. So total is 20.56875.

So tau is 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s. That seems correct.

So the product v * tau is 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 equals (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Wait 2.966 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.966 * 2.056875: Let's compute 0.9 * 2.056875 = 1.8511875.

0.066 * 2.056875 = approx (0.06 * 2.056875) = 0.1234125, plus 0.006 * 2.056875 = 0.01234125. So total 0.1234125 + 0.01234125 = 0.13575375.

So 0.966 * 2.056875 = 1.8511875 + 0.13575375 = 1.98694125.

So 2.966 * 2.056875 = 2 * 2.056875 + 0.966 * 2.056875 = 4.11375 + 1.98694125 = 6.10069125.

So L = 6.10069125e-16 m ≈ 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option A:5.0223e-16, option D:4.0655e-16.

Hmm, nowhere near 6e-16. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use relativistic equations correctly. Because the mean path length is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, I think that's another way to express it. Because the mean lifetime is tau, but the particle is moving at velocity v, so the lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer due to gamma. So L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, but I thought tau is already the mean lifetime. Wait, no, time dilation tells us that the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (which is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, which is tau = ħ / Γ). So yes, the mean lifetime observed is gamma * tau. But wait, no, wait: the width Γ is the same in all frames, because it's the decay rate, which is a Lorentz invariant. Or maybe not; I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the mean proper lifetime by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. So when the particle is moving, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the mean path length is L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, but v is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau = beta gamma c tau.

But how does that fit into the equation?

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the particle's speed correctly using energy and mass, and then plug into the decay length formula.

Wait, let me think again. The mean decay length is L = (gamma * beta) * c * tau. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau, and the speed is beta c. So the product is (gamma beta c) * tau.

So let me compute gamma * beta. Gamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887. So gamma * beta = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887. Let me compute that:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 0.6667 * 1 = 0.6667, but 0.9887 is 1.13% less than 1. So 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6667 - (0.6667 * 0.0113) ≈ 0.6667 - 0.00754 ≈ 0.65916.

So total gamma beta ≈ 5.9322 + 0.65916 ≈ 6.59136.

So L = gamma beta c tau.

c is approx 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.59136 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.59136 * 3 = 19.77408.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24: 19.77408 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute that.

19.77408 * 2 = 39.54816.

19.77408 * 0.056875 ≈ let's compute 19.77408 * 0.05 = 0.9887, and 19.77408 * 0.006875 ≈ 0.1357. So total ≈ 0.9887 + 0.1357 = 1.1244.

So total is 39.54816 + 1.1244 ≈ 40.67256.

So 40.67256e-24 * 1e8? Wait, wait no: 3e8 is 3 * 1e8, so 6.59136 * 3e8 is 1.977408e9 m/s? Wait, no, wait: 6.59136 * 3e8 = 1.977408e9 m/s. So then multiply by tau, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = (1.977408e9 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 1.977408e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977408 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Wait, because 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

1.977408 * 2.056875 ≈ let me compute that.

1.9774 * 2 = 3.9548.

1.9774 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1123.

So total approx 3.9548 + 0.1123 ≈ 4.0671.

So L ≈ 4.0671e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.067e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. So 4.067e-15 m is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. 

Hmm, so why did I get a different result earlier? Oh wait, because earlier I used L = v * tau, but didn't account for gamma correctly. So the correct approach is to use L = gamma * beta * c * tau, which gives a more accurate result. 

So the correct calculation gives L ≈4.067e-15 m, which matches option B. 

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for gamma * beta. Gamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887. So 6.6667 * 0.9887 = let me compute that more accurately.

6.6667 * 0.9887:

Break it down:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ (0.6 * 0.9887) + (0.0667 * 0.9887) 

0.6 * 0.9887 = 0.59322.

0.0667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 0.0659.

So total for 0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.59322 + 0.0659 ≈ 0.6591.

So total gamma * beta is 5.9322 + 0.6591 ≈ 6.5913.

So 6.5913 * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So 6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97739 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 1.97739 * 2 = 3.95478.

1.97739 * 0.056875 = let's compute 1.97739 * 0.05 = 0.0988695, and 1.97739 * 0.006875 = approx 0.013542.

So total 0.0988695 + 0.013542 = 0.1124115.

So adding to 3.95478, we get 3.95478 + 0.1124115 = 4.0671915.

So 4.0671915e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m. The options have option B as 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ and other constants to get a more accurate result.

Let me try that. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. That's precise enough, I think.

So, with more accurate gamma * beta:

gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666666666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.988685.

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.988685 ≈ 6.59132.

So with 6.59132 * c * tau.

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s (using more precise value for c).

tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.59132 * 2.99792458e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.59132 * 2.99792458e8 = 6.59132 * 2.99792458e8 ≈ let me compute that:

6.59132 * 3e8 ≈ 1.977396e9. But more accurately:

2.99792458e8 = 299,792,458 m/s.

6.59132 * 299,792,458 ≈ let me compute that.

6 * 299,792,458 = 1,798,754,748.

0.59132 * 299,792,458 ≈ 0.5 * 299,792,458 = 149,896,229, plus 0.09132 * 299,792,458 ≈ 27,370,000 (approx). So total approx 149,896,229 + 27,370,000 = 177,266,229.

So total 6.59132 * 299,792,458 ≈ 1,798,754,748 + 177,266,229 ≈ 1,976,020,977 m/s.

So L = 1,976,020,977 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 1,976,020,977 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, 1,976,020,977 is approx 1.976e9. 1.976e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.976 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.976 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute:

1.976 * 2 = 3.952.

1.976 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1123.

So total 3.952 + 0.1123 = 4.0643.

So L ≈ 4.0643e-15 m.

Which is very close to option B's 4.0655e-15 m. So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the mean decay length:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the mean proper lifetime, with \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and mass \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), so:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \beta \)
Using \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \tau \)
The mean proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \gamma \beta \)
\[
\gamma \beta = \gamma \cdot \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5913
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau = 6.5913 \cdot (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s})
\]

First, compute \( 6.5913 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.5913 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1.97739 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Now, multiply by \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (1.97739 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = (1.97739 \cdot 2.056875) \times 10^{-15}
\]

Compute \( 1.97739 \cdot 2.056875 \):

\[
1.97739 \cdot 2.056875 \approx 4.0672
\]

Thus:

\[
L \approx 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 4.0672 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.
