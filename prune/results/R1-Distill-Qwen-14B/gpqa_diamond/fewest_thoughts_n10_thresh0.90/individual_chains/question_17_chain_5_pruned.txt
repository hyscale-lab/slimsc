Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. Hmm, I think K here refers to the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion.

So, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like Ca²+ to form a complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- or similar. The formation constant Kf is a measure of how strong the complex is. The larger the Kf, the more stable the complex.

Wait, the problem gives KCa-EDTA as 5x10^10. I think KCa-EDTA is the same as Kf, the formation constant. So when they say the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, that means the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Because the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, right? So each Ca-EDTA complex has one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

But wait, if the complex dissociates, then the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be much lower because the complex is very stable (due to the high Kf). So the concentration of Ca²+ is what we're supposed to find.

The formation reaction is:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-
The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, the concentration of free EDTA might not be straightforward because EDTA can also be in various protonated forms. Oh, wait, the problem says the pH is ideal. I think that means the pH is such that EDTA is fully deprotonated and exists as EDTA^4-; that would make the calculation easier because we don't have to consider the different protonation states of EDTA.

So, under ideal pH, we can assume [EDTA^4-] is a certain value, and since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, the total concentration of EDTA would be 0.02 M as well because the complex is 1:1 with Ca²+. But wait, the EDTA is in the complex or free form. So the total EDTA is 0.02 M (all of it is complexed), but wait, no—wait, no, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, which is the complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that's all the EDTA and Ca²+ that's present, right? Because the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

No, wait. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. But when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the reaction is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf for the formation of CaEDTA^2- is given as 5e10. Wait, but Kf is the formation constant, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant. So Kd, the dissociation constant for the complex, would be 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this problem, we're dealing with the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse, so the equilibrium constant for that is 1/Kf. So if the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the K for that would be 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So, let's denote the dissociation as:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-; Kd = 2e-11.

We can set up an ICE table. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero.

Let x be the amount that dissociates. So,

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kd is very small, x is negligible)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Putting into the Kd expression:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-] = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02.

Set Kd equal to 2e-11:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 → x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Let me compute sqrt(4e-13):

sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) → since 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7 → 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So x
