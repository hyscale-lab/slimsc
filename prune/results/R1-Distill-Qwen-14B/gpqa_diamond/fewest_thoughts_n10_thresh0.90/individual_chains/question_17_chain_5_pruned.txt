Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my EDTA stuff, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when it's a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration is 0.02 M for the complex, and the stability constant, K, is 5x10^10. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability constant (K) is a measure of how strong that complex is. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So, the Ca-EDTA complex is pretty stable because K is like 5e10, which is a huge number.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is ideal. I think that under ideal pH conditions, the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex without any issues. So, the complex doesn't dissociate much under these conditions.

Now, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. Oh wait, wait a second. If the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, and the complex is 1:1 (since it's Ca-EDTA, which is Ca^2+ to EDTA^4-), then in pure solution without any dissociation, the concentration of Ca^2+ would be 0.02 M. But wait, that's probably not the case because the problem gives a K value, implying that the complex might dissociate some.

Wait, no. The problem says it's the stoichiometric solution, meaning that all the Ca is in the complex. Or does it? Hmm, the term 'stoichiometric' here might mean that the concentration given is the total concentration of calcium in the form of the complex. So, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.

Wait, but if the solution is just the complex, then in reality, there might be some dissociation, but given the huge K value, the dissociation would be minimal. So, the concentration of free Ca^2+ would be very low, because K is large, meaning the complex doesn't release much Ca^2+.

So, the formula for the stability constant K would be K = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[Ca-EDTA]. But in this case, the [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression.

Wait, the complex is CaY^2- where Y^4- is the EDTA. The formation reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

So the equilibrium expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Since the solution is 0.02 M in CaEDTA^2-, we can say that [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But wait, if the solution is only the complex, then the concentrations of free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are what we need to find.

But, wait, under ideal pH, the concentration of EDTA^4- is such that it's the dominant species. So, the concentration of EDTA^4- is not zero, but a certain value. Hmm, but in this case, I think we can consider that the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, and the only thing present is the complex, so the free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- come from the dissociation of the complex.

So, the dissociation would be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

So, the K for this dissociation is 1/K_form, because K_form is for the formation. Wait, K_form is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. So, the dissociation constant K_dissociation would be 1/(5e10), which is a very small number, 2e-11.

So the dissociation equation is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

K_d = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = 2e-11.

But wait, when you have a solution of the complex, the initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let me denote the change in concentration as x. So, as the complex dissociates, it produces x concentration of Ca^2+ and x concentration of EDTA^4-.

So,

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small, given K is so small).

[Ca^2+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

So, substituting into the K expression:

K_d = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

So, x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait. Let me calculate it correctly.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 10^-13 is 10^(-
