Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says I need to find out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. From the information given, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude, and HIRES can observe brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO (since it's brighter than 17) and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES (since it's brighter than 16). Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The way it's worded: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, so apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag <=16. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V mag must be <=16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. So any star that has an apparent V mag <=16 can be seen by both. But wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. So, for ESPRESSO, the V mag must be less than 17 (brighter). For HIRES, stars brighter than 16 can be observed, so V mag <16. So the star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO? No, wait, no. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star's V mag is 16, it's brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag up to 17 (so fainter than 17 is not visible, but waitâ€”wait, the question says 'brighter than 17 mag can be observed.' So stars with apparent V mag brighter (i.e., smaller number) than 17. So for ESPRESSO, the maximum observable V mag is 17, but anything brighter (lower mag) is okay. Similarly
