Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Oh right, you can't just say 0.6c minus 0.5c because that's 0.1c, but that's only true in classical mechanics. Relativity says you have to use the velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So let me plug in the values. The astronaut moving at 0.6c is the first one, and the second is at 0.5c. So from the first astronaut's frame, what's the speed of the second?

Wait, no, actually, the relative speed depends on who's measuring. If they are moving in the same direction, then their relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, u and v are their velocities relative to a common frame, so which one is u and which is v? Let me get this straight. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction.

From A's frame, what is B's speed? Because B is moving slower than A. So from A's perspective, B is moving backward? No, wait, no. Both are moving in the positive x-direction. Wait, but if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then relative to A, B is moving at a lower speed, but in the same direction.

So the formula for the relative velocity is (v' - u)/(1 - (v' u)/(c²)), I think. Wait, no, no. Wait, there's a standard formula for relative velocity in relativity. Let me think. If frame S' is moving at speed u relative to frame S, then an object moving at speed v in S would have speed v' in S' given by (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Oh wait, I'm mixing up the frames here.

In this case, perhaps the relative speed is calculated as (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 + (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²). Wait, why plus? Because if both are moving in the same direction, the denominator adds their product terms. Wait, when velocities are in the same direction, the relative speed formula's denominator would have a plus, but wait no. Let me get this right. The formula for the velocity of B as seen from A's frame is (B's speed - A's speed) divided by (1 - (B's speed * A's speed)/(c²)). But wait, no, because if you're moving in the same direction, the relative velocity is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, when you're in frame S, and frame S' is moving at velocity u, then the velocity v' of an object in S' is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)).

So in this case, from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would be (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²) → (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction. But since speed is a positive quantity, the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that matches option C and D for the relative speed.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c:
gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut with mass 3m and speed 0.5c:
gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Let's round that to about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc^2. Option D has E as 5 mc², which is less, so no.

Wait, but wait. The question says "the total energy of the system." But in relativity, the total energy is the sum of each individual energy. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct option would have relative speed 0.14c and total energy 5.96 mc². Looking back at the options:

Option C: v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc^2.

So option C matches the calculations.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. The formula when both are moving in the same direction. The relative speed is (0.5c -0.
