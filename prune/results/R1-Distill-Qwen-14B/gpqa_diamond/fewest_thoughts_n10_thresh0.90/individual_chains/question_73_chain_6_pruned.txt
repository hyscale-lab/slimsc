Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, I remember that in relativity, adding velocities isn't as straightforward as in classical mechanics. Oh right, you can't just add the speeds because that could exceed the speed of light, which isn't possible. So I think the formula for relativistic velocity addition is needed here. The formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the speed of one object as seen from the other's frame. Wait, actually, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think: if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Or wait, maybe it's (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/c²), but I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no, because both are moving in the same direction. So maybe it's (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). No, wait, because if u is the speed of one object relative to another, perhaps I should take u as the speed of the moving frame relative to the stationary one. Or maybe I should approach it differently. 

Wait, the problem says they're moving in the positive x-direction, so both are moving in the same direction. Let's say astronaut 1 has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, astronaut 2 has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. So from the perspective of astronaut 1, what is astronaut 2's speed? Because we're looking for the relative speed.

So the formula for relative velocity is (u' - v) / (1 - (u' v)/c²), where u' is the speed of the second astronaut in the first's frame. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. When you're in the frame of astronaut 1, astronaut 2 is moving at a speed (v') given by (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) ). Because v1 is the speed of the first astronaut from the lab frame, and v2 is the speed of the second. So substituting the values, v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Wait, no, wait. Wait, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. Astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the lab frame. So from astronaut 1's perspective, the speed of astronaut 2 is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²))).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 -0.3= 0.7. So v_rel is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.142857...c. Oh, but speed can't be negative,
