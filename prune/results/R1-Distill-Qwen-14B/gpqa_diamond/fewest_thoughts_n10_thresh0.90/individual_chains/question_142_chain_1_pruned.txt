Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is equal to (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), and mixed states are combinations of these.

So, the matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out in matrix form. The |0> state is [1, 0]^T and |1> is [0, 1]^T. So, |0><0| would be a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0, and |1><1| would be diagonal with 0 and 1. Adding these would give a diagonal matrix [1, 1]. Then multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So, ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements 0.5.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit unclear on what that refers to. Oh wait! I think it's about the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector has components (x, y, z), and each Pauli matrix corresponds to a direction.

Wait, but how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector? Oh right, any single-qubit state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. So for a density matrix ρ, this should hold.

Let me write that out. The identity matrix I is [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, the expression (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2 should equal ρ.

Our ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Let me compute (I + r·σ)/2. So,

(I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz) / 2 = (1/2) * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me compute each component.

The matrix (I + r·σ) is:

[[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
 [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]]

Divided by 2 gives:

[[ (1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
 [ (r_x + i
