Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star's surface affect certain atomic ratios in the photosphere. 

So the setup is: there's a star with 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, when looking at the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), the ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We're to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Alright, so I think the key here is understanding how temperature affects the energy levels of atoms. Since the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann equation would apply. The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations of two energy levels to the temperature. 

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Here, n1 and n2 are the number densities of atoms in levels 1 and 2, g's are the statistical weights, and E's are the energies. The ratio (n2/n1) depends exponentially on temperature. Since the transition is at a certain wavelength, the energy difference (E2 - E1) can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, and λ the wavelength.

But wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to 6000 K when it's spotless. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. How does this affect the ratio (n1/n2) or (n2/n1)?

Wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star's Teff is 5500 K, the ratio (n1/n2 or n2/n1) is lower. Wait, wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So let me clarify: when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So comparing when it's spotless (6000 K) to when it has spots (5500 K), the ratio is higher in the spotless case.

Wait, the observed ratio is lower when there are spots. So the ratio without spots (R1) is higher than the ratio with spots (R2). So R1/R2 would be the factor by which the ratio
