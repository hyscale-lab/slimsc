Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main observation is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They notice that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels depends on the temperature. This is governed by the Boltzmann equation, right? The Boltzmann factor tells us how the populations of energy levels change with temperature. The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels is given by (n1/n2) = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. Oh, right, the transition wavelength is given as approximately 1448 Å. So the energy difference between the two levels corresponds to that wavelength. Let me think about how to calculate the energy difference from the wavelength. Since E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

So first, I'll need to calculate the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. Once I have that, I can plug it into the Boltzmann equation to find the ratio n1/n2 at the two different temperatures (unspotted and spotted).

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the unspotted case has Teff of 6000 K, spotted is 5500 K. But wait, the spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the overall effective temperature is lower. But how does this affect the photospheric conditions?

Wait, no. The photosphere's effective temperature is given as 5500 K when spots cover 40% of the surface. So in the observed spectrum, the majority of the light comes from regions with 6000 K, but when 40% is covered by cooler spots, the average emission is at 5500 K.

Wait, but how does this relate to the local temperature where the Ti atoms are? Hmm, the problem states that the stellar photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so each region's spectrum is determined by its local temperature.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But the spots themselves are cooler than the rest. So maybe the unspotted regions are hotter. Wait, no, when the spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So let me think: the star's total luminosity is the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions. The effective temperature is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πR² σ Teff⁴.

But wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the unspotted part is at 6000 K, and the spotted part is cooler, but we don't know by how much. However, the question is about the photospheric conditions. Oh wait, perhaps the photosphere as a whole has a different temperature when spots are present.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at a lower temperature when spots are present, but that seems counterintuitive because spots are just part of the surface. Alternatively, perhaps the star's total emission is what defines Teff, which is lower when spots are present.

Wait, but in reality, the presence of spots doesn't change the photospheric temperature of the unspotted regions. The unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, say, maybe 4000 K or something. But in the problem, instead of giving the temperature of the spots, it tells us that the overall effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. Hmm, but perhaps the problem is simplifying it, so that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. So the star has a lower photospheric temperature when it's spotted.

Wait, but that can't be
