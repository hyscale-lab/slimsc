Okay, so I have this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again. 

The question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. And we have to choose the right combination from the options A to D, which involve terms like stronger, weaker, faster, slower.

Hmm, I think this has to do with the reactivity of oxygen in different solutions. Let me break it down. 

First part: Thermodynamically, oxygen as an oxidant in basic solutions. So, thermodynamic factors relate to the tendency or favorability of a reaction. The standard electrode potentials might come into play here. 

I remember that in basic conditions, the oxygen reduction reaction is more favorable. The standard reduction potential for O2 in basic solution is higher than in acidic. Wait, wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact values. Let me think. In acidic solution, the O2 reduction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, and the E° is around +1.23 V. 

But in basic solution, the same reaction would lose H+ because H+ isn't present. Instead, OH- would be involved. So the reaction becomes O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH- with a higher E°, maybe around +0.4 V or so? Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Wait, the standard potential for O2 in basic solution is actually higher than in acidic? Or is it lower? I think I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, in acidic conditions, the O2 reduction is more favorable because H+ is available. But in basic conditions, the same reaction involves OH- instead. So the standard reduction potential in basic might be lower than in acidic. But wait, no, wait—wait, the standard potentials are relative. Let me get this straight. 

The standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic is E° = 1.23 V. In basic, the potential is calculated differently. The Nernst equation might come into play. Alternatively, I remember that the E° for O2 in basic is about 0.40 V. So in basic, the E° is lower than in acidic. So that means in basic solution, the oxidizing power of O2 is less than in acidic. Because a higher E° means a stronger oxidant. 

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the E° for the reduction reaction is higher in acidic conditions. So O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent in acidic solution because the E° is higher. So in basic solution, the E° is lower, meaning O2 is a weaker oxidant there. 

Wait, but the question says, "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So comparing to acidic, in basic it's a weaker oxidant. So the first blank should be 'weaker'.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The standard E° in acidic is higher, so O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic. In basic, with lower E°, it's a weaker oxidant. So the first part is weaker.

Now the second part: Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. Kinetic factors relate to the rate of reaction. So, if a reaction is kinetically faster, it proceeds more quickly.

Oxygen's reactivity can be influenced by the solution's pH. In acidic solutions, perhaps the reaction is faster because H+ ions can act as catalysts or stabilize transition states. On the other hand, in basic solutions, maybe the OH- ions hinder the reaction by making the solution more viscous or by some other means. 

Wait, but another angle: the rate of the oxygen reduction reaction. The reaction in acidic might have a lower activation energy. Or perhaps the presence of H+ ions makes the reaction proceed more quickly. Alternatively, maybe the reaction in acidic is faster because the reaction involves H+ which are more available, leading to faster electron transfer.

Alternatively, I'm trying to remember the kinetics of oxygen reduction. I think that in acidic conditions, the reaction is generally faster. Because in basic conditions, the reaction forms OH- which can form a barrier or require more steps, slowing down the reaction.

So if in acidic, the reaction is faster, so the second blank is 'faster'.

Putting it together: The first blank is 'weaker' and the second is 'faster'. Now, looking at the options:

Option A) stronger – faster: No, first part is weaker.
Option B) stronger – slower: No, first part is weaker.
Option C) weaker – faster: Yes, this fits.
Option D) weaker – slower: No, second part should be faster.

So the correct combination is weaker and faster, which is option C.


Thermodynamically, the oxidizing power of oxygen depends on the solution's pH. In acidic solutions, the standard reduction potential of oxygen is higher (approximately +1.23 V), making oxygen a stronger oxidant. In basic solutions, the reduction potential is lower (approximately +0.40 V), meaning oxygen is a weaker oxidant. Therefore, the first blank should be "weaker."

Kinetically, the reactivity of oxygen is influenced by the availability of ions that facilitate the reaction. In acidic solutions, H⁺ ions are present and can act as catalysts, lowering the activation energy and making the reaction proceed faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, OH⁻ ions may hinder the reaction, leading to slower kinetics. Thus, the second blank should be "faster."

Combining these observations, the correct combination is "weaker – faster," which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
