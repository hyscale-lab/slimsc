Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of an operator P along some arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

First, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles like a muon, the Pauli matrices are involved. The operator P is a vector operator, so I guess it's the sum of the components multiplied by the Pauli matrices. Wait, no, each component Px, Py, Pz is given as ħ/2 times a matrix. So maybe P is a vector composed of these operators.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, so the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, I suppose. Since it's an arbitrary direction, the operator P along n would be a combination of Px, Py, and Pz. But because n is in x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero, so the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Or wait, no, wait, direction in x-z plane would have n_y =0, so the direction is (n_x, 0, n_z). So the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming theta is the angle from z-axis.

Wait, no, the unit vector in spherical coordinates would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ must be zero. So the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? So the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P along n would be P_n = (P · n) = (n_x Px + n_z Pz) because n_y is zero.

Wait, actually, Py is given as another matrix, but since the direction is in x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero, so P_n is just n_x Px + n_z Pz.

So let me write that out. Let me compute each component:

Given:
Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, P_n = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ.

So,

P_n = (sinθ)*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)*(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix:

First term: (ħ/2) * sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Second term: (ħ/2) * cosθ * [[1, 0], [0,-1]]

Adding them together:

Top row: [ (ħ/2 cosθ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ]
Bottom row: [ (ħ/2 sinθ), (-ħ/2 cosθ) ]

So the matrix P_n is (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

Now, I'm to find eigenvectors of P_n corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Hmm, but let me write the matrix and do the eigenvalue problem.

The matrix P_n can be written as (ħ/2) times the matrix M where M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2), we get M |v> = |v>, so M has eigenvalue 1.

So I need to find eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1.

The matrix M is:

[ cosθ    sinθ ]

[ sinθ   -cosθ ]

So the equation (M - I) |v> = 0.

M - I is:

[ cosθ -1    sinθ     ]

[ sinθ      -cosθ -1 ]

So the system of equations is:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

Let me write the first equation:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 => [ (cosθ -1) ] v1 = - sinθ v2

So v1 = [ (- sinθ) / (cosθ -1) ] v2

Hmm, but cosθ -1 can be written as -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So let me substitute these identities:

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2)

So v1 = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] v2

Simplify numerator and denominator:

-2 cancels, and sin(theta/2) in numerator and denominator.

So v1 = [ (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / ( 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) ] v2

Wait, wait, let me compute the fraction:

(- sinθ ) / (cosθ -1 ) = [ -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / [ -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ]

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels.

So I get [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin²(theta/2) ) ] = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2)

So v1 = [ cot(theta/2) ] v2

Hmm, so v1 = cot(theta/2) v2

So the ratio v1/v2 = cot(theta/2)

Which can be written as tan(theta/2) = v2 / v1

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the eigenvector in terms of a parameter.

Let me set v2 = 1 (since eigenvectors are up to a scalar multiple), then v1 = cot(theta/2)

But wait, when theta is 0, cos(theta) =1, sin(theta)=0.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the eigenvector can be represented as [ a, b ].

So from the first equation, (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0.

So a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Which is same as a = [ sinθ / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] b.

Since 1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] * b

Simplify: a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * b = cot(theta/2) * b

So a = cot(theta/2) b

So the vector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) b, b ] = b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

To make it a unit vector, we need to normalize.

The magnitude squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = | cot(theta/2) b |^2 + |b|^2 = b² (cot²(theta/2) + 1) )

But cot² x +1 = csc² x, so sqrt of that is |csc x|.

So the magnitude is |b| csc(theta/2).

We can choose b = sin(theta/2), so that the magnitude becomes | sin(theta/2) | * csc(theta/2) ) = 1.

Wait, because csc(theta/2) is 1/sin(theta/2), so:

|b| * csc(theta/2) = |b| / sin(theta/2) = 1 → |b| = sin(theta/2)

But since theta is between 0 and pi (because in x-z plane), sin(theta/2) is positive.

So let's set b = sin(theta/2).

Then a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

So the vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, in the first component, I have a = cos(theta/2), and b = sin(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But eigenvectors are up to a phase factor. Since quantum states are defined up to a global phase, but the options given have different forms.

Looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes, that's exactly what I have here. But wait, the question says 'what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector'. So this vector is already normalized.

Wait, but let me check. The length of [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] is sqrt( cos² + sin² ) = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

But wait, the problem states that the operator is P along direction n, so P is the sum of Px, Py, Pz multiplied by their respective components in direction n. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that.

But wait, another option is option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)). Hmm, why would there be ħ factors in the eigenvectors? Because the operator components have ħ/2, but when we find eigenvectors, the eigenvalue is ħ/2, but the eigenvector is a vector, not including ħ. Because ħ is a constant scaling factor in the operator.

Wait, the options have some options with ħ, but eigenvectors are dimensionless. Because the operator is in units of ħ/2, but when you write the eigenvector, it's just a vector of complex numbers, not involving ħ. So options A and D include ħ in their elements, which doesn't make sense for eigenvectors. So options A and D are probably incorrect.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). That looks like spherical coordinates but for spin-1/2, which has a spinor structure. But I derived (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C. So perhaps C is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thing: when the direction n is along the z-axis (theta =0), the eigenvector should be [1, 0], which is the eigenstate of Pz with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So let me plug theta=0 into option C: cos(0) =1, sin(0)=0 → [1,0], correct.

If theta is 180 degrees (pi), then cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1 → [0,1], which is the eigenstate for Pn pointing along -z (since theta is pi).

But wait, when n is along positive z, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and the state is [1,0]. If n is along negative z (theta=pi), then the operator Pn is aligned along -z. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 would correspond to the state [0,1], because Pn would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So yes, that makes sense.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly this.

What about option B: (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). Hmm, that's more like the spherical harmonics for higher spins, but for spin-1/2, the eigenvectors are these half-angle functions.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be expressed as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z
\]

Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we compute:

\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |v\r
