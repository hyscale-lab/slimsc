Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, I remember that operators in quantum mechanics can be represented by matrices. The operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. 

Let me jot down the given matrices:

- P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
- P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P here, wait, the question says it's a vector operator. Oh right, for any direction n, the operator is P · n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, because y-component is zero. Hmm, wait, n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so it can be parameterized by an angle θ from the z-axis, and φ = 0 because it's in x-z plane. Or maybe it's more general to say that the direction is given by some θ where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So φ=0 or π, but probably just θ for direction in x-z.

Wait, but the eigenvector for a spin-½ particle along an arbitrary direction n is the same as the spin-up state along n. The eigenvectors are the same as the spin states. But how does that translate into the components here?

The general form for the spin operator in direction n is P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0, so the operator simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, let me think. The direction n is an arbitrary unit vector in the x-z plane, so n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So the operator P·n is (sinθ)(P_x) + (cosθ)(P_z).

So P · n = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that matrix. So:

First, compute each term:

First term (sinθ * P_x):
(ħ/2) * [
 [0, sinθ],
 [sinθ, 0]
]

Second term (cosθ * P_z):
(ħ/2) * [
 [cosθ, 0],
 [0, -cosθ]
]

Adding them together:

P · n = (ħ/2) * [
 [cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]
 ]

Wait, because when you add the two matrices, the diagonal elements are cosθ and -cosθ, and the off-diagonal elements are sinθ.

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

So we need to find a vector (a, b) such that:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Let me write this out in components.

First component:
(ħ/2 cosθ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b = (ħ/2) a

Second component:
(ħ/2 sinθ) a + (ħ/2 (-cosθ)) b = (ħ/2) b

Simplify each equation. Let's divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify.

First equation:
cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

Second equation:
sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

So we have two equations:

1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, we can solve this system for a and b.

Let me write equation 1 as:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] b

Wait, but if I factor out a negative from denominator, cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ). So,

a = [ - sinθ / ( - (1 - cosθ) ) ] b = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator using trig identities.

I remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

sinθ / (1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] ] = cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2)

So, a = cot(θ/2) * b

So a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] b → a = [cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] * b

Let me write that as a = cot(theta/2) b.

Now, let's plug this into equation 2 to see if it holds.

Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Substituting a = cot(theta/2) b:

sinθ * cot(theta/2) b + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

[ sinθ * cot(theta/2) + (-cosθ -1) ] b = 0

Since b can't be zero (otherwise, the vector would be trivial), the term in brackets must be zero.

Let me compute sinθ * cot(theta/2):

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

sinθ * cot(theta/2) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] ] = 2 cos²(theta/2)

So back to the term:

[ 2 cos²(theta/2) + (-cosθ -1) ] = 0

Wait, because I have [ sinθ * cot(theta/2) + (-cosθ -1) ] = [ 2 cos²(theta/2) - cosθ -1 ]

Now, let's compute cosθ in terms of cos(theta/2):

cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) - 1

So substituting:

2 cos²(theta/2) - (2 cos²(theta/2) -1 ) -1

= 2 cos² -2 cos² +1 -1 → 0

So equation 2 is satisfied, which is good. So our substitution works.

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

Let me express the eigenvector in terms of b.

We can write the vector as (a, b) = b ( cot(theta/2), 1 )

We can factor out b, but to make it a normalized vector, we need to choose b such that |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar, so let's set b = 1/sqrt( |cot(theta/2)|^2 + 1 ), but wait, no, let me compute the normalization.

Wait, a = cot(theta/2) b → a = (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) b

So the vector is [
