Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Right, effective theories are used when you want to include higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the Standard Model physics. These operators are organized by their dimension, and they respect the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model.

The question is which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental part of the Standard Model. Effective theories should preserve the symmetries of the original theory. So SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, in the SMEFT framework, when you're working in a particular frame (like the lab frame), do the operators have to respect Poincare? Or does it depend on how you're considering the theory?

Wait, no. Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translational symmetries. SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory because the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant. But does SMEFT necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz, but in the effective theory, you can have operators that break translation symmetry if you're working in a specific frame. Wait, but no, because effective field theories are typically formulated in a way that respects Lorentz symmetry. So maybe Poincare is also a symmetry that must be respected.

Wait, no. Wait, the Poincare group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. In effective field theory, you're considering local symmetries in a particular spacetime, but I'm not entirely sure about whether SMEFT requires Poincare. Or does it automatically include it because it's a relativistic theory? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry is about how the theory looks under Lorentz transformations. Poincare symmetry includes that plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, it's automatically part of Poincare symmetry, but does SMEFT necessarily have to include the translation part?

Wait, in the SMEFT, you're working in a particular reference frame, right? Because
