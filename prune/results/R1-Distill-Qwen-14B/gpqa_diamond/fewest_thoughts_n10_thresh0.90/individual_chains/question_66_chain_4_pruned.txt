Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with some underlying symmetry. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? I think Lorentz symmetry includes the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it includes momentum conservation because of the translations. So Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz. 

In SMEFT, the operators are built from the Standard Model fields and include higher-dimensional terms. I remember that SMEFT preserves gauge symmetry, but what about other symmetries? Oh right, SMEFT is built respecting the Standard Model's symmetries, but does it require all operators to respect Lorentz symmetry? I think yes because the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so the effective theory should too.

So, Poincare symmetry is about the whole spacetime translations and Lorentz. Since SMEFT includes all operators built from SM fields, which are Lorentz invariant, their operators must also be Lorentz invariant. But wait, Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation invariance. SMEFT operators are local, so they should respect Poincare. Or does it? Because when you have higher-dimension operators, like in the form of (1/Lambda) * (field terms)^n, are they necessarily Poincare invariant?

Wait, the SMEFT Lagrangian is constructed to be Poincare invariant because the Standard Model is. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. Therefore, if the question is which must be respected, then both 1 and 2 are correct. But wait, the options have either 1 and 2, or maybe another combination.

Wait, but what about the other symmetries, like CP and CPT. I think that the SMEFT doesn't necessarily require all operators to respect these, because the effective theory can include terms that break these symmetries. For example, certain beyond the SM physics (like certain new physics models) can violate CP, so the effective theory allows operators that break these symmetries unless they are forbidden by the SM.

Wait, but I remember that the SMEFT Lagrangian must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes gauge symmetries, Lorentz, and some others. But CP symmetry is not a symmetry of the Standard Model when you consider CKM phases and things like the strong CP problem. So the SM doesn't require CP to be a symmetry, so SMEFT doesn't have to either.

CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry. In the SM, CPT is respected because all particles have their antiparticles, etc. However, if the effective theory includes operators that change the CPT structure, like if some terms have different CPT properties, but wait, I think the effective theory must respect CPT because the underlying theory (assuming it's a Lorentz-invariant theory) must respect CPT. Or does the effective theory allow for CPT violation?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The SMEFT is an effective theory, so the underlying theory (which is some high-energy theory) would respect certain symmetries. If the high-energy theory respects CPT, then the effective theory must also respect it because the effective theory is just a low-energy approximation. But if the high-energy theory violates CPT, then the effective theory could as well. However, in our universe, we have not observed CPT violation, so SMEFT allows for CPT preserving, but doesn't require all operators to respect it?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. The question is about what symmetries must all operators respect. So which symmetries are imposed by the structure of SMEFT, regardless of the new physics. So, what must the operators respect?

Lorentz symmetry is definitely required because the fields are included in a Lorentz-invariant way. So operators are built from SM fields, which are Lorentz scalars. So each operator must be Lorentz-invariant. Same with Poincare? Because the action must be Poincare-invariant. The action is integrated over spacetime, so for it to be invariant under translations (part of Poincare), the Lagrangian must be translation-invariant. So each term in the Lagrangian must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz.

Wait, but the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as separate options. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if the question is whether operators must respect 1,2, etc.,
