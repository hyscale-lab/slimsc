Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) and ethanol. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile would typically be from a enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. Right, because malonate esters are good Michael donors. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

So, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, no, the structure is more like CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. The acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituent at the beta position. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me. So the substituent is on the beta carbon, which is the CH2=CH- part. Wait, acrylate's structure is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon? Or perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would have the structure CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Hmm, but actually, the numbering might be different. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the acrylate group is CH2=CH-C(O)O-. So the substituent on the beta carbon would be on the CH2 part. So in methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that's 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-methyl 3-p-tolylprop-2-enoate. Wait, that would be CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or maybe it's CH2-C(C6H4-p-tolyl)=CH2-COOCH3? Hmm, not sure, but perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact structure.

Anyway, the Michael donor here is the dimethyl malonate. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it forms an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate), leading to a conjugate addition.

So the reaction would add the malonate's enolate to the acrylate. So the malonate has two methyl groups and a COOEt group. After the addition, the product would have the malonate's part attached to the acrylate.

Wait, let me think. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3)2COO- something. When it acts as a Michael donor, the enolate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate has a carbonyl group, and the enolate comes from the malonate.

So the product would be a new compound where the malonate's CH2- part is attached to the acrylate's CH2- group. Or perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 (but substituted with p-tolyl), and the malonate is (CH3)2COOCH2COOCH3? Or wait, no, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2.

When the enolate attacks the acrylate, the enolate's carbon (from the malonate) will add to the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate is RCOOCH3, with R being CH2-CH2-p-tolyl, but perhaps I'm getting the substituent wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-C6H4-p-tolyl. No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the general Michael addition. The Michael donor (enolate) attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (acceptor) at the beta position. So the product is a new carbon-carbon bond between the donor's alpha carbon and the acceptor's beta carbon.

In this case, the donor is dimethyl malonate. Its enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon. When it attacks the acrylate's beta carbon, the malonate's CH2 will add to the acrylate's CH2.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is more like this: the acceptor is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So maybe it's CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the alpha-beta unsaturated
