Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolates acting as nucleophiles attacking alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Hmm, right, so let's think this through.

The question has three parts, each a Michael addition reaction, and I need to determine the products A, B, and C.

Let's start with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, dimethyl malonate is a diester, and it's a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which will be the Michael acceptor.

When dimethyl malonate forms an enolate, the conjugate base will have a negative charge on the central carbon. The sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the alpha position of the malonate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but wait, no. Let me draw it. The acrylate is CH2-CH2, but with a substituent. Wait, no, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3? No, no. Wait, the formula is CH2=CR-COOR, where R is p-tolyl. So in (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But here it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the substituent is on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-p-tolyl? Or perhaps the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=C-(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon. That can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, no, that would be longer. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O
