Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. Alright, the setup is a bit complex, but let me break it down.

So, the problem is about an uncharged spherical conductor. It has a small cavity inside, which is also spherical. The cavity's center is a distance 's' away from the main conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is 'r', and it's smaller than the conductor's radius 'R'. Got that.

Now, there's a small positive charge '+q' placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance of P from the cavity's center is 'l', and l and L are both greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so point P is outside the conductor because L is greater than R. Since the conductor is uncharged, I think the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the conductor. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so when we put a positive charge inside the cavity, how does it affect the conductor?

Oh right! When a conductor encloses a charge, the charges inside the cavity induce charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces. But wait, because the conductor is neutral, the total charge induced on the outer surface must be zero. Let me think: the positive charge inside the cavity will cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced negative charge, so that the cavity is at zero potential. Then, the outer surface of the conductor must have an induced positive charge equal to the inner negative charge, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the conductor was neutral, so the total induced charges must cancel out the internal charge.

Wait, actually, no. The conductor was neutral, so when you place a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge opposite to the internal charge to cancel the field inside the conductor. So if the internal charge is +q, the inner surface must have -q. But since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surface charges. So initial conductor charge is zero: inner is -q, outer is +q. Ok.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. Because inside the conductor, the electric field is zero, so any charges inside the conductor (the inner surface) don't contribute to the field outside. So the field at P is just due to the +q charge on the outer surface.

Wait, but the outer surface has a charge of +q? No, wait. Let me think again. The conductor was initially neutral. The cavity has +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have -q induced because the conductor must shield the charge inside. So the inner surface is -q. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because conductor's total charge is sum of inner and outer: (-q) + (+q) = 0. Wait, no, that's
