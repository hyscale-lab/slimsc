Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit involved, but I'll take it slowly.

Alright, the problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, right, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's only proportional to that.

So, normalization. The state vector is (1+i, 2-i) in the up and down basis. The normalization factor would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component. Let me compute that.

The first component is 1+i. The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. The second component is 2-i. Magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the total is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7). So the normalized state is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, but the question says the state is proportional to that vector, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

Next part: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix Aij. The matrix Aij is given as hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. So what's the structure of this matrix?

In a two-state system, the states are |up> and |down>, so the matrix A would be:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Because for i != j, Aij = hbar/2. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but that's the matrix representation of the operator. I think this operator must correspond to some observable. Let me think. The standard Pauli matrices might be similar. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply that by hbar/2, that's exactly this A matrix. So A = (hbar/2) σx.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σx. The eigenvalues of σx are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of A. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-axis. Oh, but I'm not sure about their exact form. Let's recall that the eigenstates of σx are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σx is the spin-flip operator.

So the eigenstates of A are:
|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, but I should double-check. When you have a matrix like A = [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2,0]], then the eigenstates would satisfy A|ψ> = λ|ψ>. Let me compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The matrix A is:

0     (hbar/2)
(hbar/2)   0

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λI) = 0.

So determinant is ( -λ )*( -λ ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0 → λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2, as I thought earlier.

For the eigenvectors, taking λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) |v> = 0 →
[ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ] [a]   = 0
[ hbar/2   -hbar/2 ] [b]

Which gives equations:
(-hbar/2) a + (hbar/2) b = 0 → -a + b = 0 → b = a.

So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 1). So the eigenstate is (1,1), but we need to normalize it. So (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down>).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + λ I) →
[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ] [a] = 0
[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]

Which gives hbar/2 (a + b) =0 → a = -b.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, -1), normalized as (1/sqrt(2))(|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate when the state is |alpha> = [(1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, and it's proportional to that. So we normalized it by sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

We need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Expressing |alpha> in the basis of |+x> and |-x> will allow us to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue, which correspond to these eigenstates.

So the process is to write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients' squares give the probabilities.

So let's compute the coefficients.

Let me write |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

We can find a and b by taking inner products. Since |+x> and |-x> are orthonormal.

So a = < +x | alpha >, and b = < -x | alpha >.

Compute a:

a = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * ( [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Which is (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ].

Wait, because <up| up> is 1, and <down| down> is 1. The cross terms would be zero because <up| down> is zero.

So, (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 1 → (1+i + 2 -i) → 3. So a = (3) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) → 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute b:

b = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] * ( [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Which is (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ].

Compute the numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) ) → (-1) + 2i → (-1 + 2i).
