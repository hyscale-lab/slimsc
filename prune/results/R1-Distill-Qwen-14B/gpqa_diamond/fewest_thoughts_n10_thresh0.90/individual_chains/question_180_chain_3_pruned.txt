Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me read it again.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, so each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D, with some pretty small numbers.

Wait, so the system consists of 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of those 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. So, the interactions would be between the 13th and each of the 12, and also among the 12 themselves, right?

But wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. So this is an electrostatic potential energy system. Since these are point charges, the potential energy between each pair contributes to the total. But wait, the system's total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of all the pairs.

So, let's break it down. The total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But since the 12 charges are constrained at 2 meters from P, they don't move relative to each other. Wait, but wait a second—are the 12 charges arranged in some specific way around P? Like, are they all at the same distance but arranged in a circle or something? Or are they all at the same point? No, because their distance from P is fixed, but their positions relative to each other might vary. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. That probably means each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, the 13th is at P, and each of the other 12 is at 2 m from P. So, the distance between any two of the 12 charges could vary, but if they are constrained to stay on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m, their mutual distances can vary. But wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about their arrangement, so perhaps for the minimal energy, the charges would arrange themselves to be as close as possible. But wait, no, because the problem says they are constrained, meaning their positions are fixed at 2 m from P but can't move closer. So, perhaps their mutual distances aren't relevant for the potential energy between themselves? Or maybe they can be anywhere on the sphere, but their minimum energy would be when they are all as close as possible to each other. Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the minimum energy. So, to minimize the potential energy, the system would arrange itself to have the least possible potential energy. Since potential energy between like charges is positive, because like charges repel. So, to minimize the potential energy (which would be negative if the charges could come closer), but in our case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at a fixed distance from P, but their positions relative to each other might allow for lower potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy of the system comes from two parts: the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think. The total potential energy is the sum over all pairs. So, for the 13th charge (which I'll call charge Q) at point P, each of the 12 charges (q) is at 2 meters. So, the potential energy between Q and each q is (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2 m). Since there are 12 such pairs, that's 12 times that value.

Then, for the 12 charges, each pair would contribute (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ * d), where d is the distance between two of them. But since they're all on a sphere of radius 2m, the minimum distance between any two would be when they're as close as possible—like diametrically opposite, but that's 4m apart. Wait, no, wait. If all 12 are placed on a sphere of radius 2m, the minimum possible separation between any two is when they're as close as possible. Wait, but for 12 charges on a sphere, the most compact arrangement would be like the vertices of an icosahedron. So the minimal distance between any two would be a specific value. But wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but nothing about
