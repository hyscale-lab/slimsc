Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that X is a meson resonance with some given parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. We need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right! The formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but wait, no, more accurately, it's the speed (βc) times the lifetime, right? Because distance is speed multiplied by time. So the mean decay length L is c * τ * β. 

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ from the given parameters? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I should be careful with units here. Let me jot this down.

So, the steps I need to take: 

1. Find the lifetime τ using Γ. 
2. Calculate the velocity β of the meson.
3. Then find the mean decay distance L = β c τ.

Wait, but how do I get β? I think β is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light. So to find β, I can use the energy and mass to find the velocity. 

The energy of the meson is given as E_X = 8 GeV. Since the meson is moving relativistically, I can use the relativistic energy formula: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². 

Let me rearrange that to find p: p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c. Wait, no, let me correct that. Wait, the equation is E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So solving for p, 

p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c² ? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let's do it carefully:

E is the total energy, so E = γ m c².

p = γ m v. Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute the momentum p. 

Alternatively, I can compute β using the relation between energy, mass, and momentum. Let me think: since E = γ m c² and p = γ m v, and v = β c. So, p = γ m β c. 

But E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So, substituting p from the momentum expression: 

E² = (γ m β c² )² + (m c²)^2.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe another approach: calculate the gamma factor γ. 

Gamma is E/(m c²). Let me compute that. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. 

Wait, but wait. The unit for E and m is GeV, but I need to ensure all units are consistent. But since both E and m are in GeV, and considering that c squared is in (GeV²/(mass unit squared)), perhaps it's better to calculate in natural units where c=1, but I'll have to convert back to meters later.

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to compute the velocity beta using the energy. 

Another approach: the relativistic energy is E = γ m c². So, γ = E/(m c²). Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, γ is 8 / (1.2) ≈ 6.6667. 

Then, the velocity beta is given by beta = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Wait, no, wait. The relation is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/γ. So, 1 - beta² = 1/γ² → beta² = 1 - 1/γ². 

So, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma squared)). Let's compute that. Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6667. So 1/gamma squared is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of that is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so the velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1/γ²: (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887. 

Now, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, the units for Γ are in MeV. Let me make sure I get the units right. 

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But to convert to GeV·s, since 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J, so 1 J = 1e32 eV, etc. Alternatively, I can use the value of ħ in units where c=1 and use natural units. But perhaps it's easier to use the known value of ħ in GeV·s.

Wait, yes. ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·seconds. So Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. 

So τ = ħ / Γ. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let's compute that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, 6.582 ÷ 0.32 is roughly 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. 

Wait, or is that 2.056875e-24 seconds? Because 20.56875e-25 is the same as 2.056875e-24. That makes sense.

Now, the mean decay length L is c * beta * tau. But wait, c is in m/s, tau is in seconds, so the product c * tau would be meters. 

So let's compute L = c * beta * tau. 

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. 

So, c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters. Then multiply by beta, which is 0.9887. 

So, 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ Let's compute that. 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.111e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest I see is option D: 4.0655e-16 m, which is about half of this. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me re-calculate gamma again. Gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6666667, correct. So beta squared is 1 - 1/(gamma squared) = 1 - (1/(44.4444)) ≈ 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. That seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the formula for the decay length is different. I thought it was L = beta c tau. But wait, moving particles have their lifetime dilated, so tau is the proper time, and the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the decay length is v * gamma tau. 

Wait a second, I think I messed up the calculation. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer than the proper lifetime by a factor of gamma. So the lifetime observed is gamma * tau. 

Wait, so let's correct this. The proper lifetime tau is ħ / Gamma. The observed lifetime is gamma * tau. Because the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer. So the decay length is velocity (beta c) multiplied by the observed lifetime (gamma tau). So L = beta c gamma tau.

So, I think I forgot to include the gamma factor earlier. Oh no, that changes things a lot.

Wait, so the correct formula is L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Wait, so let me recalculate. 

Tau is ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.666667.

So, L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

So, beta is 0.9887, gamma is 6.666667, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute beta * gamma: 0.9887 * 6.666667 ≈ 6.591333.

Then, c * tau = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then, multiply by beta * gamma: 6.591333 * 6.170625e-16 = Let me compute that. 

6.591333 * 6.170625 ≈ approx 40.62. So 40.62e-16 m? Wait, but 6.591333 *6.170625 = let's calculate more accurately.

6 *6=36, 0.591333 *6 = about 3.548. 6 * 0.170625=1.02375. 0.591333 * 0.170625 ≈ 0.1009. So total is 36 + 3.548 + 1.02375 + 0.1009 ≈ 40.67265.

So approximately 40.67265e-16 m, which is 4.067265e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15, option B is 4.0655e-15. Hmm, so this is very close to 4.067e-15, which would be option B (4.0655e-15 m). But wait, perhaps my approximation of beta was a bit off. Let me compute beta more accurately.

Wait, gamma was 6.666667, so 1/gamma squared is 0.0225, so beta squared is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is:

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Using calculator approximation:

I know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604. 0.988^2 = let's see: 988 * 988 = (900 + 88)^2 = 900^2 + 2*900*88 +88^2 = 810000 + 158400 + 7744 = 810000+158400=968400+7744=976,144. So 0.988^2 = 0.976144. But 0.9775 is a bit higher. So the square root is a little higher than 0.988.

Let me compute 0.9887^2: (0.988 + 0.0007)^2. Let me compute it as 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0007 + (0.0007)^2. 0.976144 + 2*0.988*0.0007 = 2*0.988 =1.976 * 0.0007 = 0.0013832. So 0.976144 +0.0013832=0.9775272. The square of 0.9887 is about 0.9775272, which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is 0.9887.

So that part's accurate. So beta is 0.9887, gamma is 6.66667, so beta*gamma is 6.66667 *0.9887 ≈ let me compute 6.66667 *0.9887.

6.66667 *0.9887 = 6.66667 * (1 - 0.0113) = 6.66667 - (6.66667 *0.0113) ≈ 6.66667 - 0.0753333 ≈ 6.59133.

So beta*gamma is 6.59133.

So L = beta * gamma * c * tau = 6.59133 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Wait, let's compute this step by step. c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply that by beta * gamma (6.59133): 6.170625e-16 * 6.59133 ≈ Let's compute 6.170625 *6.59133.

6 *6 is 36, 6*0.59133 is about 3.548, 0.170625 *6 is about 1.02375, 0.170625 *0.59133 is about 0.1009. So 36 +3.548=39.548 +1.02375=40.57175 +0.1009=40.67265.

So 40.67265e-16 m, which is 4.067265e-15 m. 

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close, so B is the correct option.

Wait, but why is the option C 5e-15? Did I make a mistake in the formula? Because I thought I included gamma correctly this time.

Wait, going back: the decay length is velocity (beta c) multiplied by the lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma tau. So, L = beta c * gamma tau = beta gamma c tau. So that's correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the formula is L = (c * tau) * beta gamma. So that's same as what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total energy and gamma correctly. Let me double-check the calculation of gamma.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) in natural units where c=1, so gamma is 8/1.2=6.66667. Correct.

So, everything seems correct. So the calculation gives 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B.

Wait, but the options are A) 5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16. So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta = 0.9887 \), \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Next, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5913
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5913 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest value to \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is **option B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
