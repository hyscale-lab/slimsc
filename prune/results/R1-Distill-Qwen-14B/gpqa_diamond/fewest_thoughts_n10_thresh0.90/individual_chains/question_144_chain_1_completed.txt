--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And when they decay, they can turn into other particles. The question is about finding the mean decay distance, which I think is the average distance the meson travels before it decays.

The problem gives me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Oh wait, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me note that 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So Γ_X is 0.32 GeV.

I remember that the decay width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, the mean decay length L is the product of the velocity v and the lifetime τ, so L = v * τ. 

Wait, how do I find the velocity v? Oh right, from relativistic mechanics. The energy of the particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The velocity v is related to γ by v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)}. Alternatively, I can find the velocity using the relation between energy, mass, and momentum.

Alternatively, another approach: the mean decay length can be calculated using the formula L = (E / m) * c * τ. Wait, let me think again. Because the lifetime τ is given by Γ^{-1} multiplied by some factors. Hmm, maybe I should look for the formula for the mean decay length.

Wait, I think the formula is L = (E / m) * cτ. Since E = γ m c², and τ = ħ/(Γ), but wait, I need to check the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the mean path length L is given by L = (E / m) * c * (ħ / Γ). Because, from E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). Then τ = ħ/(Γ). L = v * τ = (β c) * (ħ / Γ) ), where β = v/c. But E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). So, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)}.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to calculate the velocity from the energy. Let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate the velocity v of the meson.
2. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
3. Multiply v by τ to get L.

But wait, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime. So, let me proceed step by step.

First, let's compute the Lorentz factor γ. E = γ m c². So, γ = E/(m c²). But wait, E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², respectively. Hmm, but when calculating γ, does the c² matter? Because E here is in units where c=1, perhaps. Wait, in particle physics, energies are often expressed in units where c=1, so E = γ m.

So, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So γ = E/m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Now, the velocity β is given by β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). So let's compute 1/γ^2. γ is approximately 6.6667, so γ squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. So 1/γ² is 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Taking the square root, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887c.

Wait, but I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute it step by step.

γ = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

1/γ² = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. Let me check with a calculator: sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, yes.

So, β ≈0.9887, so v is about 0.9887c.

Next, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in GeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s when using natural units (since c=1). Wait, let me remember the constants.

In natural units (ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, but perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think in terms of proper units.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for decay length.

The mean decay length L is given by L = (E * c * τ) / m.

Wait, because E = γ m c². So, E/m = γ c². So, E/(m c²) = γ. Hmm, but perhaps another way.

Alternatively, another formula I've heard is L = (E / m) * c * (ħ / Γ). Because, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ, and velocity is β c, so L = β c * τ = β c*(ħ/Γ) = (β ħ c) * (E / m Γ) ?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try to use the formula step by step.

First, calculate the velocity v. Wait, we have E = γ m c^2. So γ = E/(m c²). But since E and m are given in GeV, perhaps we can compute γ = E/(m) in units where c=1. So, γ = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Then, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ^2)).

So, β ≈ sqrt(1 - (0.0225)) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So, v ≈0.9887c.

Now, compute the lifetime τ. The width Γ is related to the lifetime via Γ = ħ / τ. So, τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is in GeV. ħ has units of GeV·s in these units (since E is in GeV, and ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s). So, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, units may be tricky. Let me think carefully.

Let me get the constants right. Let's use natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm (femto meters). But perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, since ħ = 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is 0.32 GeV.

Then, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So, τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Then, the decay length L is v * τ.

v is 0.9887c. So, L = 0.9887 * c * τ.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = 3 * 2.057 * 1e8 * 1e-24 m.

3 * 2.057 = 6.171.

1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So that's 6.171e-16 m.

Now multiply by 0.9887: 6.171e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 6.103e-16 m.

Wait, but the options are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range. Let me see the options:

Option A: 5.0223e-16 m

Option B: 4.0655e-15 m

Option C:5.0223e-15 m

Option D:4.0655e-16 m.

Wait, my calculation gave about 6.1e-16 m, but none of the options are around 6e-16. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me recheck that.

gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

beta squared is 1 - (1/(gamma^2)) → 1 - (1/(44.4444)) → 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) → let me compute that more accurately.

0.9887 squared is approximately 0.97752, yes. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

So, 0.9887^2 = (0.98 * 0.98) + ... Alternatively, use a calculator-like approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Let me compute beta more accurately.

gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So, gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444444.

So, 1/γ² = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So, 1 - 1/γ² = 0.9775.

So, sqrt(0.9775) = ?

Let me compute it accurately. Let me consider that 0.9887^2 = 0.9775.

So, beta is approximately 0.9887, which I'll take as 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator function.

Wait, 0.9887^2 = (9887/10000)^2 = (approx 9887^2) / 1e8.

But perhaps it's easier to compute sqrt(0.9775) using a Taylor expansion.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let me think of x = 0.9775.

We know that sqrt(0.98) is approximately 0.9899, because 0.9899^2 = (approx) 0.9800.

Wait, 0.9899 * 0.9899 = 0.98 (as 0.98 * 0.98 is 0.9604, but this is more precise).

Wait, perhaps I should just accept that beta is about 0.9887, as initial calculation.

So, L = 0.9887 * c * tau.

Tau is (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s → 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that:

Multiply 3e8 m/s by 2.056875e-24 s:

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.105e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have anything near 6e-16. The options are around 4e-15, 5e-15, or 4e-16, 5e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for L. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach is to compute the mean path length using the formula:

L = (E / m) * c * (ħ / Γ)

Wait, because E is the energy, m the mass, and Γ the width. Let me see:

E = γ m c², so E/(m c²) = γ.

Then, L = (E/m) * (c) * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, but that would be:

(E/m) * c * (ħ / Γ) → (γ c^2) * c * (ħ / Γ) → γ c^3 (ħ / Γ).

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

L = (E c * ħ) / (m Γ).

Let me compute that.

E =8 GeV, c=3e8 m/s, ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s, m=1.2 GeV/c², Γ=0.32 GeV.

So,

L = (8 GeV * 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (1.2 GeV * 0.32 GeV )

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Wait, wait, units:

GeV * m/s * GeV·s → GeV^2 * m/s * s → GeV^2 m.

Denominator: GeV * GeV → GeV^2.

So units: (GeV^2 m) / GeV^2 → m. Correct.

So,

Numerator: 8 * 3e8 * 6.582e-25 = 8 * 3e8 * 6.582e-25.

Let me compute that step by step.

8 *3e8 = 2.4e9.

2.4e9 *6.582e-25 = (2.4 *6.582) * 1e9 * 1e-25 )= 15.7968 * 1e-16 = 1.57968e-15.

Denominator: 1.2 *0.32=0.384.

So,

L = (1.57968e-15) / 0.384 = approx 4.1126e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.11e-15 meters, which is 4.11 x 10^-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, so my calculation using this formula gives ~4.11e-15, which is close to option B's 4.0655e-15.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute the numerator again:

8 * 3e8 = 2.4e9.

2.4e9 *6.582e-25 = 2.4e9 *6.582e-25.

Compute 2.4 *6.582 = 15.7968.

Then 1e9 *1e-25=1e-16.

So 15.7968e-16 = 1.57968e-15.

Denominator: 1.2 *0.32=0.384.

So L= (1.57968e-15) / 0.384 = ?

Let me compute 1.57968 / 0.384:

0.384 *4=1.536 → which is less than 1.57968 by about 0.04368.

So 4.0 + (0.04368 / 0.384 )= 4.0 + 0.11375 = 4.11375.

So 4.11375e-15 m.

Hmm, that's about 4.11e-15 m, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. The closest is option B: 4.0655e-15.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Another approach: the decay length is given by L = c * τ * β.

We have τ = ħ/(Γ).

So, L = c * (ħ/Γ) * β.

β is v/c, which is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to compute beta as (p c)/E.

Because E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (p c)^2 = E^2 - m^2 c^4. So, p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4).

Wait, but since we're working in units where c=1, E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², respectively, but perhaps it's easier to compute beta as (p c)/E.

Wait, let me compute p c.

E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, (p c) = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) → but since in natural units, c=1, so it's sqrt(E^2 - m^2).

So, E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

p c = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV → sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

So, beta = (p c)/E = 7.91 /8 ≈0.98875.

Ah, so that's more precise. So beta is about 0.98875.

Then, L = c * tau * beta.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

So, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So, tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → approximately 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = c * tau * beta.

c =3e8 m/s.

So, L=3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.98875.

Compute:

3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 0.98875: about 6.170625e-16 *0.98875 ≈6.105e-16 m.

Wait, that's around 6.1e-16 m. But none of the options are close to 6e-16.

Looking back at the options, option D is 4.0655e-16 m, which is about 4e-16, and option A is 5e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Another formula I've heard is that the mean decay length L is given by (c * ħ) * (E)/(m * Γ).

So, L = (c * ħ) * (E) / (m * Γ).

Let me compute that.

c =3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

E=8 GeV.

m=1.2 GeV.

Γ=0.32 GeV.

So,

L = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) * 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV * 0.32 GeV).

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator:3e8 *6.582e-25 *8 = 3e8 *6.582e-25 *8.

3 *8=24 →24e8 *6.582e-25 = 24 *6.582 = 158. (exactly: 24 *6=144, 24 *0.582=14. (Wait, 0.582 *24=13.968). So 144 +13.968=157.968.

So, 157.968e8 *1e-25 = 157.968e-17 = 1.57968e-15.

Denominator:1.2 *0.32 =0.384.

So, L = (1.57968e-15) / 0.384 ≈4.1126e-15 m.

Wait, that's 4.1126e-15 m, which is approximately 4.11e-15 m, which is close to option B's 4.0655e-15.

But earlier, using the other approach, I got L≈6.1e-16 m. Hmmm, that's conflicting.

I think I messed up the formula somewhere. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: the mean path length L is given by L = (c * τ) * β.

We have τ = ħ/(Γ), so L = c * ħ/(Γ) * β.

But beta is (p c)/E.

And p c = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) → but in natural units, p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2).

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)}.

Wait, since E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)} ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So, L = c * ħ/(Γ) * beta.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ=0.32 GeV.

So,

c * ħ / Γ = 3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV.

Compute this: 3e8 *6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16 GeV·m.

Divide by 0.32 GeV: 1.9746e-16 /0.32 =6.170625e-16 m.

Now, multiply by beta (0.9887): 6.170625e-16 *0.9887 ≈6.105e-16 m.

So, L≈6.105e-16 m.

But the options don't have anything close to this. So perhaps I have an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula for the mean decay length. Another possibility is that the mean decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * (E/(m c^2)).

Wait, because E=gamma m c^2, so gamma = E/(m c^2). So, beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)} ), but perhaps sometimes beta is approximated as 1 for high energies. But wait, in this case, 8 GeV and 1.2 GeV, so beta is about 0.9887, so it's quite high but not 1.

Wait, let me try another formula. Mean decay length is L = (E * tau c ) / m.

Because, since E = gamma m c^2, gamma = E/(m c^2). So, if tau is the lifetime, then the mean path is L = v tau = beta c tau.

But beta c tau is (beta c) * tau = (v) * tau.

Alternatively, since E=gamma m c^2, gamma is E/(m c^2). So, gamma is 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV * c^2) → but when units are in GeV and GeV/c², c=1, so gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

So, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)} ), as before.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

So, L = beta c tau = beta c (ħ/Γ).

But let's compute this accurately.

beta c is 0.9887 *3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Tau is ħ /Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply beta c * tau: 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.9661e8 *2.056875e-24.

= (2.9661 *2.056875) * 1e8 *1e-24 = 6.105e-16 m.

Again, same result, about 6.1e-16 m, which isn't matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the approach once more.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the decay length L = (E c * tau)/(m c^2) ) * c.

Wait, because E = gamma m c^2, so gamma = E/(m c^2).

Tau is ħ / Gamma.

So, L = v * tau = (beta c) * (ħ / Gamma).

But beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)} ) → which in natural units becomes sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2) ).

So, L = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} ) * (ħ/Γ).

So, let me compute each part.

Compute sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) )= sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

So, L = 3e8 m/s * 0.9887 * (6.582e-25 GeV s)/(0.32 GeV).

Compute:

3e8 *0.9887 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.582e-25 s GeV^{-1}.

Wait, let me write it as:

(2.9661e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s ) / (0.32 GeV).

The GeV cancels out.

So, (2.9661e8) * 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

Compute numerator: 2.9661e8 *6.582e-25 = 2.9661 *6.582 = approx 19.53, multiplied by 1e8 *1e-25 →1e-17.

So, 19.53e-17 =1.953e-16.

Divide by 0.32: 1.953e-16 /0.32 ≈6.103e-16 m.

Same result again. So, but none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute the decay length. Another possible formula I've heard is L = (c * ħ) * (E)/(m * Gamma).

So,

L = c * ħ * E / (m * Gamma).

Plugging in the numbers:

c =3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

E=8 GeV.

m=1.2 GeV.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So,

L = (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) * 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV * 0.32 GeV).

Compute numerator:3e8 *6.582e-25 *8 =3e8 *5.2656e-24 (since 6.582e-25 *8 =5.2656e-24).

3e8 *5.2656e-24 = 1.57968e-15 m GeV.

Denominator:1.2 *0.32 =0.384 GeV^2.

So, L= (1.57968e-15 m GeV ) / (0.384 GeV^2 )= (1.57968e-15 / 0.384) * (GeV / GeV² ) → (4.11e-15 GeV^-1) m.

Wait, but GeV^-1 is (energy)^-1, which can be converted into meters using ħ c.

Because 1 GeV^{-1} = ħ c / (1 GeV) → 6.582e-25 GeV s *3e8 m/s = 1.9746e-16 m.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me compute the units correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should note that in the denominator, we have GeV², so the entire numerator is in GeV * m (since 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV s = 3e8 *6.582e-25 m GeV).

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting me stuck. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m.

Earlier, using the formula L = (c * ħ) * E/(m * Gamma), I get L=4.11e-15 m, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15). Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute option B's value using the same approach.

Wait, perhaps when using E/(m * Gamma), let me compute that:

E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So, E/(m Gamma) = 8 / (1.2 *0.32) =8/(0.384) ≈20.8333.

Then, c * ħ = 3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s = 1.9746e-16 GeV m.

So, L= (1.9746e-16 GeV m) * (20.8333 GeV^{-1}) = about 4.106e-15 m.

Which is around 4.106e-15 m, which is close to option B's 4.0655e-15.

Wait, maybe I should compute more accurately.

Compute E/(m Gamma):

E/(m Gamma) = 8/(1.2 * 0.32) = 8/(0.384) = 20.833333333.

c * ħ =3e8 *6.582e-25 = 1.9746e-16 m GeV.

So, L = 1.9746e-16 m GeV * 20.833333 GeV^{-1}.

So, GeV cancels out, leaving m.

1.9746e-16 *20.833333 = ?

Compute 1.9746 *20.833333.

20 *1.9746 =39.492.

0.833333 *1.9746≈1.6468.

So total is approx 41.1388.

So, 41.1388e-16 m → 4.11388e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.114e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise values.

Compute E/(m Gamma):

8/(1.2 *0.32) =8/(0.384) = 8000/384 → let's compute 8000 ÷ 384.

384 *20=7680, 8000-7680=320. 384*0.833333=320.

So 20.83333333333.

Now, compute c* ħ: 3e8 m/s * 6.582e-25 GeV s.

3e8 *6.582e-25 = (3 *6.582) *1e8 *1e-25.

3*6.582=19.746.

1e8 *1e-25 =1e-17.

So 19.746e-17 =1.9746e-16 m GeV.

Now, L =1.9746e-16 m GeV * 20.833333 GeV^{-1}.

So, 1.9746e-16 *20.833333 → 1.9746 *20.833333 = ?

Let me compute 20 *1.9746 =39.492.

0.833333 *1.9746 = let's compute 0.8*1.9746=1.57968, 0.033333*1.9746≈0.06582. So total is 1.57968 + 0.06582=1.6455.

Total is 39.492 +1.6455=41.1375.

So, 41.1375e-16 m =4.11375e-15 m.

Hmm, but the option B is 4.0655e-15, which is slightly lower.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula earlier. Alternatively, maybe I should use the proper formula involving gamma and beta.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = (c * ħ) * (gamma)/(Gamma).

Because gamma is E/(m c^2) =8/(1.2) =6.6667.

So, L = (c * ħ) * gamma / Gamma.

So,

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

gamma=6.6667.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So,

L=3e8 *6.582e-25 *6.6667 / 0.32.

Compute:

3e8 *6.582e-25 =1.9746e-16.

Multiply by 6.6667: 1.9746e-16 *6.6667≈ 1.3164e-15.

Divide by 0.32: 1.3164e-15 /0.32≈4.11375e-15 m.

Same as before. So, 4.11375e-15 m.

So, but the closest option is B:4.0655e-15.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would yield the precise value. Let me compute it with more precise numbers.

Compute gamma =8 GeV /1.2 GeV =6.6666666667.

Compute (c * ħ) =3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s =1.9746e-16 m GeV.

Then,

gamma/(Gamma) =6.6666666667 /0.32 =20.8333333333.

So,

L=1.9746e-16 m GeV *20.8333333333 GeV^{-1}.

Which is 1.9746e-16 *20.8333333333 = (1.9746 *20.8333333333 )e-16.

Compute 1.9746 *20.8333333333.

Let me compute:

20.8333333333 = 208333333333/10^8.

But perhaps using a calculator approach:

20.8333333333 *1.9746 → 

Let me compute 20 *1.9746 =39.492.

0.8333333333 *1.9746 → 1.6455.

Total:39.492 +1.6455=41.1375.

So, 41.1375e-16 →4.11375e-15 m.

Hmm, same as before.

But the options don't have 4.11e-15. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, or perhaps the correct option is option B, but let me check the question again.

Wait, the question says X is a meson resonance. The decay length is the mean distance it travels before decaying.

I think perhaps my approach is correct, but the options might have a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and perhaps the correct formula is different.

Wait, another formula I found online is L = (E c tau) / m.

Where tau is ħ / Gamma.

So,

L = (E c tau) / m.

So,

E=8 GeV.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=6.582e-25 /0.32 GeV →2.056875e-24 s.

m=1.2 GeV/c² → but in units where c=1, m=1.2 GeV.

So,

L=(8 *3e8 *2.056875e-24 ) /1.2.

Compute numerator:8 *3e8 =2.4e9.

2.4e9 *2.056875e-24 =4.9365e-15.

Divide by 1.2:4.9365e-15 /1.2=4.11375e-15 m.

Same result again. So, this must be correct, but the options don't have this value. Unless I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E/(m Gamma) earlier. Let me recheck:

E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, Gamma=0.32 GeV.

E/(m Gamma)=8/(1.2 *0.32) =8/(0.384)=20.83333333.

So, 20.83333333.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute beta * (c tau).

But perhaps the correct decay length formula is:

L = (c tau) * (E/(m c^2)).

Which would be L = c tau * gamma.

Because gamma = E/(m c^2).

So,

gamma=8 /1.2 =6.66666667.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=6.582e-25 /0.32=2.056875e-24 s.

So,

c tau =3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by gamma:6.170625e-16 *6.66666667=4.11375e-15 m.

Same result.

So, the correct decay length is approximately 4.11375e-15 m, but none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is option B:4.0655e-15 m. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the gamma/(Gamma) term. Let me compute gamma=8/(1.2) =6.66666666667.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

gamma/Gamma=6.66666666667 /0.32 =20.8333333333.

But perhaps using the exact value of ħ: 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Let me compute everything again:

L = (c * ħ * E) / (m * Gamma).

So,

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

E=8 GeV.

m=1.2 GeV.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So,

Numerator:3e8 *6.582e-25 *8 =3e8 *5.2656e-24=1.57968e-15 GeV m.

Denominator:1.2 *0.32=0.384 GeV^2.

So, L=1.57968e-15 /0.384 → 4.11375e-15 m.

Hmm, but option B is 4.0655e-15. Maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.57968e-15 /0.384 accurately.

1.57968 /0.384 = ?

Let me compute 0.384 *4=1.536.

So,

1.57968 -1.536=0.04368.

0.04368 /0.384 =0.11375.

So, 4.11375.

So, 4.11375e-15 m.

Which is 4.11375e-15 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I should look for a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E/(m Gamma) more accurately.

E/(m Gamma) =8/(1.2*0.32)=8/(0.384)=20.83333333333333.

But perhaps when I compute c * ħ=3e8 *6.582e-25.

3e8=3 *1e8.

6.582e-25=6.582 *1e-25.

So, 3 *6.582=19.746.

1e8 *1e-25=1e-17.

So, 19.746e-17=1.9746e-16 m GeV.

Multiply by 20.83333333333333:

1.9746e-16 *20.83333333333333 = (1.9746 *20.83333333333333 )e-16.

Compute 1.9746 *20.83333333333333.

20 *1.9746 =39.492.

0.8333333333333333 *1.9746=1.6455.

Total=39.492+1.6455=41.1375.

So, 41.1375e-16=4.11375e-15 m.

Hmm, so it's definitely 4.11375e-15 m, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic formula for the lifetime.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is L = (c * ħ) * (gamma) / (Gamma * m).

Wait, because gamma = E/(m c^2). So,

gamma = E/(m c^2).

But when using natural units, gamma = E/m.

So,

L = (c * ħ) * (gamma) / (Gamma * m).

So,

gamma =8/1.2=6.6666667.

So,

L= (3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s) * (6.6666667) / (0.32 GeV *1.2 GeV).

Wait, let's compute the denominator.

0.32 *1.2 =0.384 GeV².

Numerator:3e8 *6.582e-25 *6.6666667 = ?

3e8=3 *1e8.

6.582e-25=6.582 *1e-25.

6.6666667=20/3.

So,

3 *6.582=19.746.

Multiply by 6.6666667: 19.746 *6.6666667=131.64.

Now, 1e8 *1e-25=1e-17.

So, numerator is 131.64e-17 GeV m.

Denominator:0.384 GeV².

So,

L= (131.64e-17 m GeV ) / (0.384 GeV² )= (131.64 /0.384 )e-17 m GeV / GeV² → (342.5 )e-17 m GeV^{-1}.

Wait, but GeV^{-1} can be converted to meters using ħ c.

Because 1 GeV^{-1} = ħ c / GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this approach again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula L = (E c tau )/ m, as I did earlier.

With E=8 GeV, c=3e8 m/s, tau=2.056875e-24 s, m=1.2 GeV.

So,

L= (8 *3e8 *2.056875e-24 ) /1.2.

Compute numerator:8*3e8=2.4e9.

2.4e9 *2.056875e-24=4.9365e-15.

Divide by 1.2:4.9365e-15 /1.2=4.11375e-15 m.

Same result.

So, perhaps the correct answer is approximately 4.11e-15 m, but none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, another approach to compute beta using E and m:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)} ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)).

Which is sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1-x) around x=0.

sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8 - x^3/16 ...

Here, x=0.0225.

So,

sqrt(0.9775)=sqrt(1 -0.0225)=1 -0.0225/2 - (0.0225)^2/(8) - ... 

Compute:

0.0225/2=0.01125.

(0.0225)^2=0.00050625. Divided by 8 →0.00006328125.

So,

1 -0.01125 -0.00006328125=0.98868671875.

So, beta≈0.9886867.

So, more accurately, beta=0.9886867.

Now, let's redo the calculation with this more precise beta.

L = c * tau * beta.

c=3e8 m/s.

Tau=2.056875e-24 s.

Beta=0.9886867.

So,

L=3e8 *2.056875e-24 *0.9886867.

=3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 0.9886867: 6.170625e-16 *0.9886867≈6.103e-16 m.

Which brings me back to the same problem as before.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula L = (c * tau) * (E/(m c²)).

Because, E=gamma m c² → E/(m c²)=gamma. So,

L = (c tau) * gamma.

Which is what I did earlier, leading to 4.11e-15 m.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses beta c tau, but with beta =v/c = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)}.

Wait, let me compute beta with more precise numbers.

E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So,

m²=1.44.

E²=64.

So, 1 - (m²/E²)=1-0.0225=0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9886867.

So, beta=0.9886867.

So,

v=beta c=0.9886867 *3e8 m/s=2.96606e8 m/s.

Tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L=2.96606e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s =2.96606e8 *2.056875e-24.

= 2.96606 *2.056875e-16.

2.96606 *2.056875 = approximately 6.103e0.

So, 6.103e-16 m.

Again, same result.

Hmm, but the options are:

A)5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16.

So, perhaps none of them match, but I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the decay length in terms of ħ c.

Because, when dealing with units, sometimes it's easier to use ħ c.

Let me compute L = (E * ħ c )/(m * Gamma c^2}.

Wait, because E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², respectively. So, let me compute:

L = (E * ħ c )/(m Gamma c²}.

Which simplifies to (E ħ )/(m Gamma c}.

But I'm getting stuck on units, so perhaps this approach is better.

Compute:

E=8 GeV.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

c=3e8 m/s.

m=1.2 GeV/c².

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So,

L= (8 GeV *6.582e-25 GeV s *3e8 m/s ) / (1.2 GeV/c² *0.32 GeV * c).

Note that c appears in the denominator.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:8 *6.582e-25 *3e8 =8*3e8=2.4e9; 2.4e9 *6.582e-25=1.57968e-15 GeV² s.

Denominator:1.2 *0.32=0.384 GeV²; 0.384 GeV² * c.

So,

L= (1.57968e-15 GeV² s * m ) / (0.384 GeV² * c * s ).

Wait, the units:

GeV² s * m / (GeV² * m/s * s ) ) → m.

Because denominator is GeV² * (m/s ) * s → GeV² m.

So,

L = (1.57968e-15 * m ) / (0.384 GeV^2 * (m/s *s )) ) → but perhaps I'm complicating.

Alternatively, compute the numerical value.

After the units cancel out, L = (8 *6.582e-25 *3e8 ) / (1.2 *0.32 *c ) * m.

Wait, but c is 3e8 m/s, so denominator becomes 1.2*0.32*3e8.

So,

Numerator:8 *6.582e-25 *3e8 =8 * (6.582e-25 *3e8 ) =8 *1.9746e-16 =1.57968e-15.

Denominator:1.2 *0.32 *3e8 = 1.2 *0.32=0.384; 0.384 *3e8=1.152e8.

So,

L=1.57968e-15 /1.152e8 = (1.57968 /1.152 )e-23 m.

1.57968 /1.152 → approximately 1.37.

So, 1.37e-23 m.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in this approach.

I think I'm stuck. Given that all the approaches I've tried lead to a decay length of approximately 4.11e-15 m, but none of the options match, perhaps the correct option is option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the problem uses the total decay width Γ or the natural linewidth Γ/2π.

Wait, the width given is Γ=320 MeV=0.32 GeV.

But in some contexts, the natural linewidth is Γ = half the total decay width, so Γ/2π.

Wait, perhaps that's where I'm making the mistake.

Because in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the lifetime is tau ≈ ħ/(Gamma), but if the width is the natural linewidth (Γ=Γ_total /2π), then tau = ħ *2π / Gamma_total.

Wait, no, the total decay width Γ is related to the lifetime via Γ= ħ / tau.

But if someone uses Γ as the natural linewidth (Γ=Γ_total /2π), then tau= ħ *2π / Γ_total.

Wait, I think I need to clarify this.

The relation between the decay width and the lifetime is Γ = ħ / tau.

But in some conventions, the natural linewidth is Γ_N = Γ_total /2π.

So, if the problem gives Γ as the natural linewidth, then Γ_total = 2π Γ.

So, in that case, tau= ħ/(Gamma_total) = ħ/(2π Gamma).

Which would change the calculations.

So, perhaps that's where the mistake is.

So, let me recalculate with this possibility.

If Gamma=320 MeV is the natural linewidth (Γ_N), then the total decay width Γ_total =2π *Gamma_N.

So, Γ_total=2π *0.32 GeV ≈2.0106 GeV.

Then, tau= ħ / Γ_total.

So,

tau=6.582e-25 GeV s / (2.0106 GeV )=3.273e-25 s.

Now, recalculating L:

L= c * tau * beta.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=3.273e-25 s.

beta=0.9886867.

So,

L=3e8 *3.273e-25 *0.9886867.

3e8 *3.273e-25=9.819e-17.

Multiply by 0.9886867: approx 9.705e-17 m.

Wait, that's 9.7e-17 m, which doesn't match any option either.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay width given is Γ=320 MeV, which is the total decay width, so no adjustment is needed.

Given that, I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 4.11e-15 m, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 4.0655e-15 m, which is the closest to my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the formula involving E/(m Gamma).

Wait, let me recompute option B's value.

Option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Using L= (c * ħ) * (E)/(m * Gamma).

Compute each part accurately.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

E=8 GeV.

m=1.2 GeV.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So,

(c * ħ) =3e8 *6.582e-25 =1.9746e-16 m GeV.

(E/(m Gamma))=8/(1.2 *0.32)=8/0.384=20.8333333333.

So,

L=1.9746e-16 *20.8333333333 = 4.11375e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, perhaps I should recompute using more precise values for ħ.

The value of ħ is approximately 6.581999999999999e-25 GeV·s.

So, using ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Then,

c* ħ=3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s =1.9746e-16 m GeV.

E/(m Gamma)=20.8333333333.

So,

L=1.9746e-16 *20.8333333333 =4.11375e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E/(m Gamma).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses E/(m c^2) times something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is L = (E c tau)/(m c^2).

Which would be L= (E c tau) / (m c^2) )= (E tau)/(m c).

Wait, but since E=gamma m c^2, this would be (gamma m c^2 * tau)/(m c) )= gamma c tau.

Which brings us back to the previous approach, leading to 4.11e-15 m.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the options, I think the intended answer is option B:4.0655e-15 m, perhaps because of an approximation in the calculation of beta. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \frac{E \cdot c \cdot \tau}{m}
\]

where:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the production energy,
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is the mass,
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total decay width,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the lifetime,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light,
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The lifetime is given by:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity factor \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to the energy and mass by:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}.
\]
Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = \beta \cdot c \cdot \tau.
\]
Substituting \( \beta = 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 0.9887 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}.
\]
\[
L \approx 6.103 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value \( L \approx 6.103 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, using an alternative formula for \( L \) as:
\[
L = \frac{c \cdot \hbar \cdot E}{m \cdot \Gamma},
\]
yields a result closer to the options. Substituting the values:
\[
L = \frac{(3 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.582 \times 10^{-25}) \cdot 8}{1.2 \cdot 0.32}.
\]
\[
L = \frac{1.9746 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 8}{0.384} = \frac{1.57968 \times 10^{-15}}{0.384} \approx 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]
This result is approximately \( 4.11 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which is closest to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

### Conclusion
Given the discrepancy between the calculated values and the options, and assuming the problem uses the total decay width \( \Gamma \) directly, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: B**
