--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants are involved in complex formation. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, for each complex, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN^- ions attached.

The complexes would be Co(SCN)0, Co(SCN)1, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4. Wait, but the β values given seem to be for each step. So β1 is for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, β2 for the second, and so on.

Wait, actually, I think each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So, β1 is K1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]). Similarly, β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} / ([Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-]), and so on.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about how the stability constants are defined here. Oh right, stability constants are cumulative. So the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 through βn. Or wait, no, that's for stepwise formation constants. Let me think. For a complex that forms stepwise, the overall formation constant K_total is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But wait, in this problem, the β values given are for each step. So for each n, βn is the stepwise formation constant for adding the nth SCN^- ion.

So for the first complex, Co(SCN), the β1 is 9. For the second, Co(SCN)2, the β2 is 40. But wait, the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)2 would be β1 * β2, which is 9*40=360.

Wait, the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one, right? Because dithiocyanato would be two SCN^- ligands attached. So the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} is the dithiocyanato species. So we need to find the fraction of this species relative to all possible cobalt species.

Wait, but the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue one is the tetraaqua dithiocyanato complex, but maybe that's not relevant here. Anyway, the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which is the complex with two SCN^- ligands.

So to find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the mole fractions of each possible cobalt complex and then find the fraction that corresponds to dithiocyanato (n=2).

How do I approach this? I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution of the species depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and compute their concentrations using the stability constants. But with four possible complexes, this might get a bit complicated.

Alternatively, the problem can be approached by considering the distribution of Co between the different complexes. The total concentration of Co is the sum of the concentrations of all the complexes.

Let me denote the concentration of each complex as follows:

[Co] = [Co(H2O)6]^2+ (the free Co^2+ ion)
[CoSCN]^+ = [Co(H2O)5SCN]^+
[Co(SCN)2]^{2-} = [Co(H2O)4(SCN)2]^{2-}
[Co(SCN)3]^{3-} = [Co(H2O)3(SCN)3]^{3-}
[Co(SCN)4]^{4-} = [Co(SCN)4]^{4-}

Wait, but the problem states that the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So the sum of all these complex concentrations plus any other species (like aqua complexes) should add up to 1e-2 M. But wait, the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex. So the main task is to compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} in the total Co species.

The problem is that the solution is also in the presence of excess SCN^- (0.1 M), so the formation of complexes will be favored.

To model this, I can use the concept of the formation of each complex step by step, considering the stepwise formation constants.

So the approach would be to write the expressions for each complex's concentration in terms of the previous one, and then express all in terms of the free Co^2+.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Start with the free Co^2+ concentration, [Co^2+].

2. The concentration of the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, is β1 * [Co^2+][SCN^-].

3. The concentration of the second complex, [Co(SCN)2]^{2-}, is β2 * [CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-] = β2 * β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Wait, no, that's not correct because each step builds on the previous. Let me correct this.

Actually, the stepwise formation constant for the nth complex is βn. So for each step, the concentration of the next complex is given by the previous complex multiplied by βn and [SCN^-].

So:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)2]^{2-} = β2 [CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-] = β2 β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)3]^{3-} = β3 [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} [SCN^-] = β3 β2 β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)4]^{4-} = β4 [Co(SCN)3]^{3-} [SCN^-] = β4 β3 β2 β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

But wait, I think these are the expressions for the concentrations of each complex in terms of [Co^2+], which is the free ion.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the formation constants are written as:

β1 = [CoSCN]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])
β2 = [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} / ([CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-])
β3 = [Co(SCN)3]^{3-} / ([Co(SCN)2]^{2-} [SCN^-])
β4 = [Co(SCN)4]^{4-} / ([Co(SCN)3]^{3-} [SCN^-])

So, rearranging each:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]
[Co(SCN)2]^{2-} = β2 [CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-] = β2 (β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]) [SCN^-] = β1 β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)3]^{3-} = β3 [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} [SCN^-] = β3 (β1 β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2) [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)4]^{4-} = β4 [Co(SCN)3]^{3-} [SCN^-] = β4 (β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3) [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4

So, each complex's concentration is proportional to the product of all β's up to that point multiplied by [Co^2+] and the corresponding power of [SCN^-].

Now, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of the concentrations of all these complexes and any other species, but the problem says the total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M. So, the sum of [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} + [Co(SCN)3]^{3-} + [Co(SCN)4]^{4-} = 1e-2.

Wait, but I think in this scenario, the [Co^2+] is part of that sum. So the total is [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} + [Co(SCN)3]^{3-} + [Co(SCN)4]^{4-} = 1e-2 M.

But that seems a bit complicated because we have four complexes and their concentrations expressed in terms of [Co^2+], which we don't know yet.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that [Co^2+] is negligible compared to the complexes, but that's not something I can assume without checking.

Wait, in the presence of a high concentration of SCN^- (0.1 M), the formation of complexes is favored, so the free [Co^2+] might be low. So perhaps the majority of the cobalt is in the form of complexes. But I can't be sure without doing the math.

So, perhaps the way to approach this is to let [Co^2+] be x, and express all the other concentrations in terms of x, then sum them all and set equal to 1e-2.

Let me denote:

Let [Co^2+] = x.

Then,

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)2]^{2-} = β1 * β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2 = 9*40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)3]^{3-} = β1*β2*β3 * x * [SCN^-]^3 = 9*40*63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 22680 x * 0.001 = 22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)4]^{4-} = β1*β2*β3*β4 * x * [SCN^-]^4 = 9*40*63*16 * x * (0.1)^4.

Calculating that: 9 *40 = 360, 360 *63=22680, 22680*16 = 362880.

So [Co(SCN)4]^{4-} = 362880 x * (0.1)^4 = 362880 x * 0.0001 = 36.288 x.

Wait, but wait. Let me check that calculation again. 9 *40 is 360, yes. 360 *63 is indeed 22680. 22680 *16 is:

22680 *10=226800, 22680 *6=136080 → total 226800 +136080= 362,880. So yes, that's correct.

So [Co(SCN)4]^{4-} = 362880 * x * (0.1)^4 = 362880 x * 0.0001 = 36.288 x.

Wait, wait, but (0.1)^4 is 0.0001, correct. So 362880 *0.0001 is 36.288. So yes, 36.288 x.

So now, the sum of all the species is x (from free Co^2+) plus all the complexes:

Sum = x + 0.9x + 3.6x + 22.68x + 36.288x = 1e-2.

Wait, adding them up:

x + 0.9x = 1.9x.

1.9x +3.6x = 5.5x.

5.5x +22.68x=28.18x.

28.18x +36.288x=64.468x.

So 64.468 x = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1e-2 is 0.01.

64.468 x = 0.01 → x = 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

So [Co^2+] is approximately 0.0001551 M.

Now, let's compute each complex's concentration.

[CoSCN]^+ = 0.9 x ≈ 0.9 *0.0001551 ≈ 0.0001396 M.

[Co(SCN)2]^{2-} =3.6 x ≈ 3.6 *0.0001551 ≈0.00055836 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^{3-}=22.68 x ≈22.68 *0.0001551 ≈0.003523 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^{4-}=36.288 x ≈36.288 *0.0001551≈0.005626 M.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each step.

Compute [CoSCN]^+:

0.9 * 0.0001551 = 0.00013959 ≈ 0.0001396 M.

[Co(SCN)2]^{2-}: 3.6 * 0.0001551 = 0.00055836 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^{3-}:22.68 *0.0001551 → let's compute 22 * 0.0001551 = 0.0034122, and 0.68 *0.0001551≈0.000105468. So total ≈0.0034122 +0.000105468 = 0.003517668 ≈ 0.003518 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^{4-}:36.288 * 0.0001551 = Let's compute 36 * 0.0001551 = 0.0055836. 0.288 *0.0001551 ≈0.00004465. So total ≈0.0055836 +0.00004465 = 0.00562825 ≈0.005628 M.

Now, let's check the sum of all these concentrations:

x = 0.0001551

[CoSCN]^+ → 0.0001396 → sum so far: 0.0001551 +0.0001396=0.0002947.

Add [Co(SCN)2]: 0.0002947 +0.00055836 =0.00085306.

Add [Co(SCN)3]: 0.00085306 +0.003518 → 0.00437106.

Add [Co(SCN)4]:0.00437106 +0.005628 → 0.01 M. Which matches the given total Co concentration. Perfect, so our calculations are correct.

Now, we need to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} (the dithiocyanato complex) among all the Co species.

The concentration of [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} is 0.00055836 M.

The total concentration is 0.01 M as given.

So the fraction is 0.00055836 /0.01 = 0.055836 → 5.5836%.

Wait, that's about 5.58%, but that's not matching any of the options. Wait, no, wait. The options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%. Hmm, that's nowhere near 5.5%. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait a second. Let me re-examine my calculations. Because the problem is about the dithiocyanato complexes, and the calculation I did for [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} is 0.00055836 M, which is about 5.5% of the total. But that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the formation constants. Let me go back.

Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's all four β's. But the complexes go up to n=4, so the four β's are for the four steps.

Wait, perhaps I used the β's correctly, but maybe I made a computational error in the sum of the species.

Wait, let me recheck the sum.

x + 0.9x = 1.9x.

+3.6x → 5.5x.

+22.68x → 28.18x.

+36.288x →64.468x.

So 64.468x = 0.01 → x =0.01 /64.468 = approximately 0.0001551 M. That part seems correct.

Then, the concentrations:

[CoSCN]^+ = 0.9 x →0.9 * 0.0001551≈0.0001396 M.

[Co(SCN)2]^{2-}=3.6 x →3.6 *0.0001551 = 0.00055836 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^{3-}=22.68 x →22.68 *0.0001551 ≈0.003517 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^{4-}=36.288 x →36.288 *0.0001551 ≈0.005628 M.

Summing all the concentrations:

x (0.0001551) → 0.0001551.

+ 0.0001396 → 0.0002947.

+0.00055836 → 0.00085306.

+0.003517 → 0.00437006.

+0.005628 → 0.010 (exactly 0.010, as needed).

So the calculations are correct. But according to this, the [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} is 0.00055836 M, which is 5.58% of the total. But the options don't include this. So I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, sometimes the dithiocyanato complex can have different structures, like tetraaqua dithiocyanato (which is [Co(H2O)4(SCN)2]^2+). But perhaps I'm considering the wrong β's.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the β's given are not stepwise but overall formation constants for each complex. So the β for the first complex is [CoSCN]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = β1 =9.

For the second complex, [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = β2=40.

Wait, that can't be, because that would imply that the overall β for each complex is given, but that's not the usual way. Typically, βn is the stepwise formation constant, so each βn is for adding the nth ligand.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are given as the overall formation constants, so β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. But that would change the way we model the concentrations.

Wait, if that's the case, then [CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-].

[Co(SCN)2]^{2-} = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

[Co(SCN)3]^{3-} = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3.

[Co(SCN)4]^{4-} = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

If that's the case, the way we model each complex's concentration is different.

That would change the way the concentrations are computed.

Wait, but in that scenario, each step isn't building on the previous. That is, the formation of Co(SCN)2^2- doesn't involve the intermediate CoSCN^+.

Which approach is correct?

Hmm, I think the stability constants are typically given as stepwise formation constants. So the initial approach I took was correct.

But given that the calculation leads to the [Co(SCN)2]^{2-} being about 5.58%, which isn't an option, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the exponents for [SCN^-].

Wait, in my initial approach, each complex's concentration is [Co^2+] multiplied by the product of all previous β's and the appropriate power of [SCN^-].

So,

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)2]^{2-} = β1 * β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that [SCN^-] for each step is the same, so the exponent increases by one each time.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I used [SCN^-] =0.1 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the [SCN^-] in solution is 0.1 M, but when forming the complexes, each addition consumes a SCN^-.

But in the expressions I used, each complex's concentration already includes the correct power of [SCN^-].

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the cumulative formation constant for each complex. Wait, the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of the β's up to n.

So, let me define K1 = β1 =9.

K2 = β1*β2=9*40=360.

K3= β1*β2*β3= 9*40*63= 22680.

K4= β1*β2*β3*β4=22680*16=362880.

So, the concentration of each complex would be:

[CoSCN]^+ = K1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)2]^{2-} = K2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)3]^{3-} = K3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)4]^{4-} = K4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

Wait, but wait. No, that's not correct. Because the overall K for the nth complex is the product of all the β's up to n. So for the first complex, K1=β1=9. For the second, K2=β1*β2=360, etc.

If that's the case, then each complex's concentration can be expressed as:

[CoSCN]^+ = K1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)2]^{2-} = K2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Wait, but wait, no. Because each step depends on the previous complex. So the way I originally calculated is correct when using stepwise constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the first and second complexes, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should represent the concentrations in terms of the overall log β's, but I'm not sure.

Let me try a different approach. Perhaps using the distribution of species can be modeled using the formula for each species' fraction.

The fraction of each species can be calculated using the expression:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So, the denominator is the sum of each term for n=0 to 4, where each term is the product of β's up to n multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but for the 0th term (n=0), it's 1 (since there's no β, just [Co^2+]).

So, for each species n, the fraction is (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / sum_{i=0 to 4} (K_i [SCN^-]^i).

Where K_n is the product of β's up to n.

Wait, but for n=0, K_0=1, so the term is 1.

So, let's compute each K_n:

K_0 =1

K_1=β1=9

K_2=β1 β2=9*40=360

K_3= β1 β2 β3=360*63=22680

K_4= β1 β2 β3 β4=22680 *16=362880.

Now, compute each term K_n [SCN^-]^n:

Term0: K_0 [SCN^-]^0 =1 *1=1.

Term1: K_1 [SCN^-]^1=9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: K_2 [SCN^-]^2=360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: K_3 [SCN^-]^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: K_4 [SCN^-]^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Now, the sum of these terms is 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me calculate that:

1 +0.9=1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So, the denominator is 64.468.

The fraction for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is term2 / denominator =3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05576 or 5.576%.

Again, this gives around 5.576%, which is about 5.58%, but that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, but the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Because β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). But when considering the stepwise formation, the β's may not be in order. Hmm, but that's not a mistake in calculation, just in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the exponents. Let me recheck.

Wait, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, correct.

Term2: K_2 [SCN^-]^2 =360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which can be either the tetraaqua (n=2) or another isomer. But the problem states the blue ones, which I think refers to the tetraaqua dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(H2O)4(SCN)2]^2+.

Wait, but perhaps the β's given are for the formation of the different aqua complexes. Hmm, perhaps the stability constants given are for the complexes with different numbers of SCN ligands and different aqua ligands.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem and the β's are not stepwise. Let me try an alternative approach considering all possible complexes.

Wait, another approach is to model the problem using the distribution of Co species based on the ligand concentration and stability constants.

The formula for the mole fraction of species n is:

Xn = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So, for n=2 (dithiocyanato), X2 would be (β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2) / sum_terms.

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So X2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 5.576%.

So, but the options are not including this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each complex has multiple isomeric forms, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the total concentration of all species, including the uncomplexed Co^2+, and the sum of the fractions needs to be considered.

Wait, but if the sum is 64.468, which we've already considered, I'm not sure what else to do.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the charge on the complexes, but I don't think that affects the distribution as we've accounted for the formation constants correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm applying the β's. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, for each step, the βn is the stepwise formation constant. So, the way I applied them earlier should be correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions. Let me recompute the sum:

sum_terms = 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

1 +0.9 is 1.9.

1.9 +3.6 =5.5.

5.5 +22.68 =28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 =0.05576 →5.576%.

But the options are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

Hmm, none of these match. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the question is about the formation of the Co(SCN)2 complex in the presence of aqueous solution, and the concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M, but perhaps the calculation should include more terms or a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the complexes can dissociate, but I accounted for that by using the formation constants.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the log of the stability constants. But no, the β's are given as regular numbers, not logs.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the concentrations using the β's as given, but perhaps I should model the concentrations differently.

Another approach: let's denote the concentration of each complex as follows:

Let [Co] = [Co(SCN)_0] = x.

[Co(SCN)_1] = β1 x [SCN] =9 x (0.1) =0.9x.

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co(SCN)_1] [SCN] =40 * 0.9x *0.1 =3.6x.

Wait, wait, that's the same as before.

So, perhaps the problem is not in the approach but in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total concentration including the complexes, but perhaps the problem is considering that the total concentration is the sum of all the species, including the free Co^2+.

But I think I accounted for that correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the [Co(SCN)_2] is the only dithiocyanato complex, but maybe there are other isomeric forms, like [Co(SCN)(H2O)_5]^+ and [Co(SCN)_2(H2O)_4]^2+, etc. But I think the problem is considering all possible complexes, regardless of the number of aqua ligands, and just counting the number of SCN ligands.

In that case, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} is the same as the tetraaqua complex or another form, but regardless, the calculation remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the overall formation constant for a specific complex, not considering all possible steps. For example, perhaps the β given for n=2 is 40, so the overall K for Co(SCN)_2 is 40, not considering β1.

Wait, that's a possibility. So if β2 is 40, perhaps that's the overall β for the second complex, not the stepwise.

Wait, if that's the case, then the approach changes.

So, if β2 is the overall formation constant for the second complex, then:

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, [CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-].

But if β1 is the overall K for the first complex, and β2 is the overall K for the second, then the sum would be:

sum = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

So, in this case, [Co^2+] = x.

sum = x (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 ) =1e-2.

Plugging in the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN^-] =0.1 M.

So,

sum =x (1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4 )

Compute each term:

1=1

9 *0.1=0.9.

40 *0.01=0.4.

63 *0.001=0.063.

16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum inside the parentheses: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So, (1 + ... + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )=2.3646.

So sum = x *2.3646 =1e-2 → x= (1e-2)/2.3646 ≈0.004230 M.

Now, compute each complex's concentration:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 x [SCN] =9 *0.004230 *0.1 →9 *0.004230=0.03807, *0.1=0.003807 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}= β2 x [SCN]^2=40 *0.004230 *0.01=40 *0.004230=0.1692; 0.1692 *0.01=0.001692 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^{3-}= β3 x [SCN]^3=63 *0.004230 *0.001=63 *0.004230=0.26589; 0.26589 *0.001=0.00026589 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}= β4 x [SCN]^4=16 *0.004230 *0.0001=16 *0.004230=0.06768; 0.06768 *0.0001=0.000006768 M.

So, now, the concentrations are:

[Co^2+] = x=0.004230 M.

[CoSCN]^+ =0.003807 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}=0.001692 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^{3-}=0.00026589 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}=0.000006768 M.

Now, the sum of all these should be 1e-2 M. Let's check:

x=0.004230.

+0.003807 → 0.008037.

+0.001692 → 0.009729.

+0.00026589 →0.00999489.

+0.000006768 →0.010001658 M. Close enough, considering rounding.

Now, the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} is (0.001692 / 0.01) *100 =16.92%.

Which corresponds to option D)16.9%.

Ah! So that's one of the options given. So this approach must be correct.

Wait, but why did this approach work when the previous one didn't? Because in this case, I'm assuming that each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex, not the stepwise.

So, perhaps the problem defines the β's as the overall formation constants for each complex. So, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}, etc.

In that case, each complex's concentration is [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n multiplied by βn.

So, the correct approach is to compute the fractions using the overall β's, not the stepwise.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

In chemistry, stability constants are usually given as overall constants. So, for each complex, the stability constant is the equilibrium constant for its formation from the free ions.

So, for [CoSCN]^+, K1=β1=9= [CoSCN]^+ /([Co^2+][SCN^-]).

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}, K2=β2=40= [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2).

So, in this case, each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. Therefore, the approach where each term is βn [SCN^-]^n multiplied by [Co^2+] is correct.

So, in this case, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} is (β2 [SCN^-]^2) / (sum of βn [SCN^-]^n for n=0 to4).

Which is (40*(0.1)^2) / (1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4 ) →0.4/2.3646 ≈0.1692 →16.92%.

So, the correct answer is option D)16.9%.

This makes sense now. I think I initially misunderstood the problem, assuming the β's were stepwise, but using them as overall constants gives one of the provided options.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}) among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species in the solution. The stability constants provided are interpreted as overall formation constants for the complexes, not stepwise constants. The total cobalt concentration is given as 10^{-2} M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants**:  
   The stability constants are interpreted as overall formation constants for each complex:
   - β1 = 9 for [CoSCN]^+  
   - β2 = 40 for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}  
   - β3 = 63 for [Co(SCN)_3]^{3-}  
   - β4 = 16 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-}  

2. **Concentration Terms**:  
   The concentration of each cobalt species is proportional to the product of the stability constant and the appropriate power of [SCN^-]. The general form is:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_n}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]  
   where \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \) is the free cobalt ion concentration.

3. **Distribution of Species**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2-}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^{3-}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{4-}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions for each species in terms of \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \), the total concentration becomes:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right) = 10^{-2}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the Denominator**:  
   Substituting the given values (\( \beta_1 = 9, \beta_2 = 40, \beta_3 = 63, \beta_4 = 16, [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)):  
   \[
   1 + (9)(0.1) + (40)(0.1)^2 + (63)(0.1)^3 + (16)(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]

5. **Free Cobalt Ion Concentration**:  
   Solving for \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \):  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004230 \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}:  
   Using the expression for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2-}] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = (40)(0.004230)(0.1)^2 = 0.001692 \, \text{M}.
   \]

7. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}:  
   The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^{2-}]}{\text{Total Co concentration}} \times 100 = \frac{0.001692}{0.01} \times 100 = 16.92\%.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
