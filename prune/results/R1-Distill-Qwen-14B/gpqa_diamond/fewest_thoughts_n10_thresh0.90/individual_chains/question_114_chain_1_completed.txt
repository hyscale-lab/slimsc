Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Hmm, let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, I think it's probably an example of a nucleophilic addition. Oh yeah, ketones can undergo addition reactions with cyanide. So in the presence of an acid catalyst, the cyanide would attack the carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait. I remember that for the addition of HCN or CN- to ketones, you typically use an acid catalyst. Like H3O+ or H2SO4 or something. So reagent A is probably an acid. So looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3 in some options.

The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add CN, it should become (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or wait, wait. Oh, no. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw it: the molecule is CH2(CN)(OH)CH3. So the ketone (C=O) becomes a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin.

So for that, the conditions should involve a strong acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile, then the CN- attacks. Once the addition happens, the proton is removed, leading to the formation of the alcohol and nitrile.

So in the first step, the reagent A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, whereas options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, but wait. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-. It's used in certain reactions, like maybe for the hydrolysis of nitriles? Or wait, no, in the cyanohydrin formation, you usually use an acid like H2SO4 or HCl or H3O+ as the catalyst. So A is likely H3O+.

So for the first part, reagent A is H3O+. So options A or B.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (that's a mouthful) reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, wait. The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So when you treat a nitrile with a strong acid and water, what happens? Oh, hydrolysis! Nitriles can undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids under acidic conditions, especially with heat and H2O.

Wait, but the starting molecule already has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So it's a secondary alcohol. So when the nitrile group is hydrolyzed, it would become a carboxylic acid. But how does the hydroxyl group affect this?

Wait, the structure is (something)CH(OH)CN. When you hydrolyze the CN to COOH, you're adding two oxygens. So the product would be (something)CH(OH)COOH.

But wait, the reagents are H2O and B. Hmm. So in the reaction, we're adding water and another reagent, B. Wait, no, the question says that reagent B is H2O. So the reagent provided is H2O and B. Wait, no, the way it's written is: "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) --> product". Oh, so B is the reagent, and H2O is present.

Wait, perhaps I misread. So the reaction is: the starting nitrile reacts with reagent B in the presence of H2O. So B is the catalyst or condition.

So what conditions cause nitriles to hydrolyze to carboxylic acids? Typically, strong acids like H2SO4, HCl, or maybe heating with water. So for the hydrolysis of nitriles, you can use either acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, you get the carboxylic acid. Under basic conditions, you might get the ammonium salt of the carboxylic acid, which then can be acidified.

So in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid. So probably the reaction is done under acidic conditions, with H2O.

So what's reagent B? Looking at the options, the choices for B are HCl (option A), CH3COOH (option B), HCl (option C), or CH3COOH (option D).

Wait, but in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (as I thought). Now, in the second reaction, B is the reagent used, and the reaction is in H2O. So if reagent B is HCl, then the reaction is done in acidic conditions. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, that's an acid too.

Wait, but what's the role of reagent B in the second reaction? Let me think. The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So the molecule is (CH2)2C(OH)CN attached to the benzyl group. When we hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, the conditions need to be acidic.

So to hydrolyze the nitrile, you'd need an acid catalyst. So B would be an acid. So possible options are HCl (from options) or CH3COOH.

Which is a stronger acid? HCl is a stronger acid than CH3COOH. But for nitrile hydrolysis, both could work. But typically, when using H2O, you might use HCl as the catalyst, especially if the reaction is in aqueous solution.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, so maybe the reaction is under acidic conditions.

So putting it all together: in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B). In the second, reagent B is HCl (so options A or C) or another acid like CH3COOH (options B or D).

Wait, but let me think again. The first reaction's reagent A is H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, could NaHSO3 be a possible source of H+? Because NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which in solution would dissociate into Na+ and HSO3^-.

But in an acid-catalyzed reaction, like for the formation of cyanohydrin, you need an H+ source. So in the first step, the reagent is H3O+ or another acid. NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is a strong acid). So maybe if the reaction is in aqueous solution, H3O+ is more likely. Alternatively, if the reaction is in a different solvent, maybe NaHSO3 is used.

Wait, but the second reaction's reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So if the first reaction uses H3O+ (A), then in the options, A is either option A or B. Then for the second reaction, if B is HCl (as in option A or C), or CH3COOH (option B or D).

But perhaps I need to think about the specifics. Let me look up what reagents are typically used in these reactions.

Wait, the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The usual reagents are a ketone, HCN, and an acid catalyst. So that would fit with A being H3O+.

The second reaction is the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. The typical reagent is H2O with an acid catalyst like H2SO4 or HCl. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might use NaOH and then acidify, but in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's probably done under acidic conditions.

So for reaction 2, B should be an acid, like HCl. So the reagent B is HCl.

Looking back at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. That fits both reactions.

Alternatively, let me look at the other options. Option D is A=NaHSO3 and B=CH3COOH. Hmm, if the first reaction uses NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid than H3O+. Would that work? I'm not sure, but I think that the formation of cyanohydrin typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst. So H3O+ would be more suitable. So probably, option A is correct.

Wait, but wait. Another point: in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the hydroxyl group comes from where? The ketone is (CH3)2CO. When HCN adds, the oxygen becomes hydroxyl, and the nitrile group adds. So the process is acid-catalyzed, with HCN as the cyanide source. So in the presence of H3O+, the reaction proceeds.

So for the first reaction, A must be H3O+.

For the second reaction, the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is HCl (as it's an acid catalyst), which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So the answer should be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the cyanide ion to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and is commonly used as a catalyst for such reactions. Sodium bisulfate (NaHSO₃) is a weaker acid and less likely to be used here. Therefore, reagent A is likely H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This reaction typically requires acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl, to facilitate the hydrolysis. While CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is also an acid, HCl is a stronger acid and more commonly used for this type of reaction. Thus, reagent B is likely HCl.

Considering the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This fits both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B is less suitable for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is less suitable for the first reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both A and B are less suitable for their respective reactions.

The most suitable option is **A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
