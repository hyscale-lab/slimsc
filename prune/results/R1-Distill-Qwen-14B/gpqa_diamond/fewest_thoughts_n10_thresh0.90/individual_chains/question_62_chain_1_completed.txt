Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of synthesis questions. Let's take a deep breath and break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. It looks like there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group (–CH(OH)–) connected to another cyclohexane ring. Additionally, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) on the cyclohexane ring as well. So, the structure might have two cyclohexane rings connected via a hydroxymethyl group, and one of them has an aldehyde.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl means a carbon-carbon triple bond, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (–C≡CH) attached. I need to figure out the sequence of reactions that converts this into the target molecule.

Looking at the options, all of them involve several reagents. Let's think about what each reagent does.

First, I'll consider the possible reactions for ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl groups can undergo various additions. One common reaction is the hydration of the triple bond. But how? There are different ways to add water or other groups to a triple bond.

Wait, but in the options, the first reagent is NaNH2 and something else. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation or elimination reactions. Maybe it's for a coupling reaction or for deprotonating a compound to make a stronger base.

Looking at the first step of each option:

Option A: NaNH2 with methyl chloride. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. But wait, where would the proton come from? Maybe the ethynyl group is acidic. The sp-hybridized carbon in the triple bond has acidic protons because of the sp hybridization and the triple bond's electron-withdrawing nature.

So, in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, the ethynyl proton could be abstracted, forming a cyclohexenide anion (with a negative charge on the triple bond carbon). Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would act as an alkylating agent. The methyl would attach to the deprotonated carbon. So, ethynylcyclohexane (RC≡CH) would become R-C≡C-Me after this step. Wait, no, because NaNH2 and CH3Cl would form R-C≡C–– (deprotonated) attacking CH3Cl, giving R-C≡C-CH2– (but I'm not sure about that). Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling reaction, like a Gilman reagent, but that usually involves Cu. Alternatively, maybe it's a C–C alkylation.

Wait, another possibility: Using NaNH2 and methyl chloride in this way is a dehydrohalogenation? Or maybe it's a protection step. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to form a cyclohexenyl lithium or Grignard, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation to form a strong base, which can then react with another compound. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the target structure again.

The target has a cyclohexyl group connected via a hydroxymethyl (–CH(OH)–) group to another cyclohexane ring, and one of the rings has an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group to the triple bond, followed by some hydrogenation, then oxidation, and so on.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. But NaNH2 is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated first.

But let me think about each reagent step by step.

Looking at the options, let's outline each step for each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, wait, the third step is Ba(OH)2 and the fourth is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That fourth step looks like it's for oxidation, perhaps the Jones oxidation (CrO3 in H2SO4), but HgSO4 is a different oxidizing agent. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for epoxidation or elimination.

Alternatively, the fourth step (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) sounds like a condition for oxidation, maybe of an alcohol to a ketone or an aldehyde. Wait, HgSO4 is used in the oxidation of alcohols, particularly secondary alcohols to ketones, and primary alcohols to carboxylic acids under strong acidic conditions. But in this case, H2SO4 and HgSO4 with H2O—maybe it's a Jones-type oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth step is for the oxidation of a diol to a ketone or something else. Hmm.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

The first step: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. Similar to option A, but with ethyl instead of methyl. So perhaps adding an ethyl group to the triple bond.

Second step: Li in liquid NH3. That's a typical setup for Birch reductions or for deprotonating to form strong bases, or for alkyne reductions. Wait, no. Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is used for the Birch reduction, which is for aromatic rings, but maybe for other reductions. Alternatively, it could be part of a conjugate addition or a reaction involving organometallics.

Wait, another thought: after adding ethyl to the triple bond, perhaps the next step is a reduction. Maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated, but with Li and NH3, perhaps an alkyne is reduced to a cis or trans alkene. But I'm not too sure about that.

Third step: O3 followed by H2O. That's ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds.

Fourth step: NH4OH. That's aqueous ammonium hydroxide, perhaps used to work up an ozonolysis (like reductive workup), but sometimes used in other reactions. Maybe it's for hydrolysis.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Hmm. First step same as option A and C. Second step is H2 and Pd over calcium carbonate, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is hydrogenated to an ethyl group.

Third step: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide, which would typically give aldehydes or ketones without over-oxidizing. So perhaps breaking a double bond into carbonyls.

Fourth step: Ba(OH)2. That's a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxidation. Or perhaps for deprotonating something or forming an epoxide.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

First step: Using NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent, but under basic conditions, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so it could deprotonate something. If it's reacting with methanol, maybe it's deprotonating and then quenching with methanol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkylation, but with methanol as the alkylating agent.

Wait, no, methanol is a poor electrophile unless activated. Hmm, perhaps this is for a different kind of reaction, like forming a Grignard or something else. I'm a bit unsure here.

Now, let's try to figure out the desired transformations.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me try to break down the synthesis steps needed.

Starting from ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane ring with –C≡CH group).

One approach could be to add a substituent to the triple bond, then hydrogenate it, then form a carbonyl group, and then perhaps do some oxidation or other functional group transformations.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond needs to be converted into a carbonyl group. For example, the ethynyl group (–C≡CH) could be converted to a ketone or aldehyde.

But in the target molecule, there's a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring, and an aldehyde on another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a substituted acetylene, then hydrogenated, then oxidized.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to add a methyl group to the triple bond, turning the ethynyl group into a propargyl group. Then, hydrogenate that to a CH2CH2 group? Wait, no, hydrogenation of propargyl would give a trans double bond if using H2 and a catalyst, but perhaps that's not right.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's imagine that the triple bond is at a certain position. To form the target molecule, perhaps we need to add a group to the triple bond, hydrogenate it to a single bond, and then perform oxidation or other steps.

Let me think about each option's steps.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: Maybe adds a methyl group to the triple bond. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2CH2 (no, wait, after alkylation, would it be (CH2)3CH?), no. Wait, if you deprotonate the ethynyl (RC≡CH), abstract a proton to form RC≡C⁻, then react with CH3Cl, you'd get RC≡C–CH3. So that would be propargyl group attached to cyclohexane: cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3: Hydrogenation. So the triple bond becomes a single bond. Propargyl would become CH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, when you hydrogenate a triple bond, you can get either cis or trans double bond, or all the way to single bond depending on the catalyst and conditions. H2 with Pd as a catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane–CH2CH2–CH3? Wait no, wait. The propargyl group is CH2CH2? No, wait, propargyl is CH2–C≡CH. Wait, no, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane–C≡CH. So after alkylation with methyl chloride, we have cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3. Then hydrogenate that with H2 and Pd to turn the triple bond into a single bond. So it becomes cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of the triple bond (C≡C) to single bond would add two H's across each carbon. So each C goes from sp to sp³. So the structure would be cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3. Wait, that would be a single bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, but if it's cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3, then hydrogenation would give cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3. No, wait, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3 group. So after hydrogenation, it becomes cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3. So that's a straight chain.

But in the target molecule, there's a cyclohexyl group connected via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, maybe after alkylation, the triple bond becomes a double bond, but I don't think so because the hydrogenation would typically reduce the triple bond all the way.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If you have cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3, and you hydrogenate it with H2 and Pd, you'll add H across each triple bond carbon. So the triple bond (sp-hybridized) becomes single bond (sp³). So each carbon gains two Hs.

So the structure would become cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3. But wait, that would be a three-carbon chain: cyclohexane connected to CH2–CH2–CH3. So that's not the case for the target molecule.

Wait, perhaps the target has a cyclohexyl group connected via a hydroxymethyl group, so the structure might have a CH(OH)– group attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the alkylation adds a substituent that can later become that hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence involves epoxidation and then ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Option C's next steps: after H2/Pd, we have O3 and (CH3)2S. So ozonolysis would break a double bond into carbonyl groups. But if the previous step was hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond, there's no double bond. Hmm. Unless perhaps in this option, the hydrogenation doesn't go all the way. Wait, no, Pd with H2 is a catalyst for full hydrogenation, so it would convert the triple bond to a single bond, not leaving a double bond. So if that's the case, how would ozonolysis come into play? Maybe I'm missing something.

Option B's steps: first, alkylation with ethyl chloride, then Li in NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or for a Birch reduction, or for deprotonation. Alternatively, perhaps it's for a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group (–CH(OH)–) attached to another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from a Grignard or organometallic reagent addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming an epoxide and then opening it with an acid to form a diol, which can then be oxidized.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is as follows: 

1. Take ethynylcyclohexane.

2. Alkylate the triple bond with a methyl group (using NaNH2 and methyl chloride), turning it into propargylcyclohexane.

3. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexane with a CH2CH2CH3 group? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation introduces a double bond.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation is not full. Oh, wait, some catalysts hydrogenate triple bonds to cis alkenes, while others go all the way. For example, using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst (Pd with quinoline) would hydrogenate a triple bond to a cis double bond, but if you use a different catalyst, maybe it goes further. But in this case, the options have H2 with Pd and CaCO3, which I think is a regular hydrogenation catalyst, so it would go all the way to single bond.

So after step 2, the triple bond is gone, and we have a single bond.

But then, for ozonolysis, we need a double bond. So perhaps the hydrogenation isn't the next step, but maybe something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to form a propargyl group, the second step is to hydrogenate it to a double bond (maybe using a different catalyst, but the options don't say that). Let me think.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation to form a propargyl group. Then, in the next step, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would give a single bond. But then, how do we get the double bond needed for ozonolysis?

Hmm, maybe that's not the way. Let me think about each option's steps again.

Option C: Steps 1 and 2 would give a single bond, but step 3 uses ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Option B: Steps 1 and 2: Alkylation, then Li in NH3. Maybe Li in NH3 is used for deprotonation or for elimination. After alkylation, perhaps the triple bond becomes a longer chain, and then step 2 is a reduction or elimination.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option B would add an ethyl group to the triple bond, giving a longer chain, then using Li in NH3 (Birch conditions?) to reduce some part.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the triple bond is still present, and then Li in NH3 is a base that deprotonates, leading to some elimination to form a longer carbon chain.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the target: it has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is then attached to another cyclohexane that has an aldehyde group.

Wait, maybe the aldehyde comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol. So perhaps the steps involve forming a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the pathway is: ethynylcyclohexane → add a group → hydrogenate → form a diol → oxidize to aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation.

Wait, but ethynyl groups can be oxidized. For example, using O3 would cleave the triple bond into carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethynyl group (–C≡CH) can be converted into a ketone. For example, using O3 followed by a reductive workup (like Zn) would give two carbonyl groups. But the target has only one aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol via some dihydroxylation, then further oxidized.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: forms a propargyl group.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, giving a –CH2–CH2–CH3 group attached to cyclohexane.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: but if the molecule is a single bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. Unless there's a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, so perhaps after step 2, there's a double bond? Let me think. If the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, then where is the double bond coming from? Maybe I'm missing something in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making a propargyl group, but then hydrogenation doesn't fully hydrogenate it. Maybe it's done under conditions that stop at the double bond (like using Lindlar's catalyst). But the options don't specify that. They just have H2 and Pd, which I think would fully hydrogenate.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a –CH(OH)– group attached, which is connected to another cyclohexane. Also, one of the cyclohexanes has an aldehyde group.

So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol from a diene, then oxidizing to form the aldehyde. Alternatively, forming a secondary alcohol and then oxidizing.

Wait, perhaps the propargyl group is hydrogenated to a vinyl group, then undergoes addition (like hydroboration) to form an alcohol, which can then be oxidized.

But I'm not seeing the steps clearly. Let me try to outline the possible steps for each option.

Option C:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Deprotonate the triple bond, add methyl group → propargylcyclohexane (cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3).

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate the triple bond to CH2–CH2–CH3. So structure is cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: but this requires a double bond. After step 2, the molecule is a straight chain with single bonds. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything here. So this doesn't make sense.

Therefore, option C probably isn't the correct sequence.

Looking at option B:

1. Alkylation with ethyl chloride → cyclohexane–C≡C–CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3: perhaps reduces the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond. For example, using Li and NH3 (Birch conditions?), or maybe it's a deprotonation step.

Wait, Li in NH3 is a strong base. Maybe it abstracts a proton adjacent to the triple bond, leading to elimination and forming a double bond. So the triple bond would become a double bond, making an alkyne into an alkene.

So, after step 2, perhaps we have cyclohexane–C=CH–CH2CH3 or something like that.

Then, step 3: O3 followed by H2O. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, if the structure after step 2 is cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH2CH3 (no, wait, wait). If the triple bond was converted to a double bond, the structure would be cyclohexane–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂CH3? No, wait, after Li/NH3, perhaps the triple bond becomes a double bond. So the structure would be cyclohexane–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂CH3? No, that doesn't seem to make sense. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond becomes a double bond, making it cyclohexane–C≡C–CH2CH3 → cyclohexane–C=CH–CH2CH3? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is for a different reaction. Wait, another possibility: the ethynyl group after alkylation becomes a longer chain, and then Li and NH3 is used for a reduction. For example, Li/NH3 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to reduce the triple bond to a single bond. But I'm not certain.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: perhaps deprotonates the ethynyl group and then quenches with methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent, but under basic conditions, perhaps it's a different kind of alkylation.

Wait, perhaps this step is a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a protection step. I'm not entirely sure.

But maybe in this step, the ethynyl group becomes a methoxy group or something else. Not sure.

Option D's next steps: Li in NH3, then ozonolysis, then NH4OH. Similar to option B but with different reagents.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think of the overall strategy.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a –CH(OH)– group attached to another cyclohexane. The aldehyde is on the same or another ring.

Perhaps the synthesis involves adding a group to the triple bond, hydrogenating it, then forming an alcohol, which is oxidized to an aldehyde.

Another thought: the ethynyl group could be converted into a carbonyl group. For example, using a hydroboration reaction, or via oxidation.

Wait, another approach: the ethynyl group can undergo hydroboration to form a carbonyl group. But for that, you need a borane reagent. Alternatively, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions would oxidize the triple bond to a carboxylic acid. But none of the options involve KMnO4.

Wait, looking back at the options, the fourth step in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which sounds like a Jones-type oxidation. So perhaps in that case, a primary alcohol is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, but the target has an aldehyde, so maybe a secondary alcohol would oxidize to a ketone, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add a methyl group to the triple bond via alkylation.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Then, form a ketone via some oxidation.

Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then undergoes ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's imagine the steps for option C:

1. Alkylation: cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3.

2. Hydrogenate with H2/Pd: becomes cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3.

Then, O3 would need a double bond, but without it, ozonolysis can't happen. So maybe option C is not the right path.

Another approach: the target molecule has an aldehyde. So perhaps we need to form a carbonyl group via oxidation of a primary alcohol.

So, the steps could be:

- Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylate → add a new group → hydrogenate → form a diol or alcohol → oxidize to aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, considering the target molecule, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group comes from a hydroboration reaction on a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a double bond, then subjected to hydroboration to form an alcohol, which becomes the hydroxymethyl group.

Let me think about option B:

1. Alkylation with ethyl chloride gives a longer chain.

2. Li in NH3: perhaps reduces the triple bond to a double bond, creating a diene or a monoene.

3. Ozonolysis: would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: maybe workup or hydrolysis.

But wait, the target has an aldehyde. So, if ozonolysis is done, perhaps one of the carbonyls is an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, one end becomes an aldehyde and the other a ketone. Then, perhaps the ketone is reduced or something else.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break into two carbonyls.

4. Workup to form aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing how the cyclohexane rings connect.

Wait, another thought: the ethynylcyclohexane, after alkylation, becomes propargylcyclohexane. Then, hydrogenated to cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3. Then, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for some kind of elimination, like forming a diol, which can then be oxidized.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for epoxidation or for forming an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's for elimination to form a double bond. But in the presence of Ba(OH)2, perhaps the –CH2–CH2–CH3 group is converted into something else.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the target molecule is formed via a substitution reaction where the ethynyl group is replaced by a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a Grignard reagent, adding it to the ethynylcyclohexane, and then working it up.

Wait, but the options don't involve Mg, so probably not a Grignard.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then subjected to some aldehyde-forming conditions.

Wait, maybe step 1 in option A adds a methyl group, step 2 hydrogenates the triple bond, step 3 uses Ba(OH)2 for elimination or oxidation, and step 4 oxidizes further.

But I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Maybe I should try to think of the correct reagent sequence.

The target molecule has two cyclohexane rings connected by a hydroxymethyl group, and one of the rings has an aldehyde. So, I think the steps must involve forming a new cyclohexane ring attached via a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylate the triple bond to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, creating a longer chain.

3. Perform a dihydroxylation to form a diol.

4. Oxidize to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming a diol, Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, forming a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a –CH(OH)– group attached to another cyclohexane. Perhaps this is formed via a ring-opening of an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the triple bond to add a methyl group, forming a propargyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, creating a –CH2–CH2–CH3 group.

3. Ozonolysis is not applicable here, so perhaps another step is needed.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the options again.

Option D: first step is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a poor electrophile, but under basic conditions, perhaps it's used for something else. Maybe the ethynyl group is deprotonated and then quenched with methanol, adding an OMe group. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, NaNH2 in methanol would be a strong base. Maybe it deprotonates the ethynyl group, then reacts with methanol to form a methyl ether? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is forming a cyclohexenide anion, which then reacts with something else, but I'm not certain.

Option B's steps: after alkylation and Li/NH3, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a cis or trans double bond, then ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups. Then, NH4OH (a mild acid) is used to work up the ozonolysis.

Wait, the target molecule has two cyclohexane rings connected by a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps one of the ozonolysis products is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the other part forms the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the triple bond to add a methyl group.

2. Reduce the triple bond to a double bond.

3. Ozonolyze the double bond to form aldehyde groups.

4. Hydrolyze to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps looking at the target molecule again, the aldehyde is on a cyclohexane ring, and the hydroxymethyl is attached to another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a new cyclohexane ring via some ring-forming reaction.

But I'm not seeing how.

Another thought: the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent to the cyclohexane ring, which is then oxidized to form the aldehyde.

But how?

Hmm. Maybe the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylate to add a methyl group → cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3.

2. Reduce the triple bond to a single bond → cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3.

3. Oxidize the end CH3 to a COOH group → cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–COOH.

4. Then, reduce the COOH to a CH2OH group, but that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2CH2CH3 is converted into a diol, then oxidized to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but without knowing the exact steps, I'm struggling.

At this point, I think the correct answer is option C. Because after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule would have a longer chain, then ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups, which could form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is the correct one because after hydrogenation, the molecule has a single bond, then ozonolysis isn't applicable, so maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible products of each option.

Option C:

Step 1: Alkylation → propargyl group.

Step 2: Hydrogenate → single bond, CH2CH2CH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so no reaction.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination?

So, this doesn't make sense.

Option B:

Step 1: Alkylation → ethyl group added.

Step 2: Li/NH3 → perhaps reduce the triple bond.

Wait, Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions, but for alkyne reductions, perhaps it forms a trans double bond.

Then, step 3: Ozonolysis → breaks double bond into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → maybe workup.

If the product after ozonolysis has an aldehyde group and another carbonyl, maybe the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring, and the other part becomes the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option B's steps are:

1. Alkylation to ethyl.

2. Reduce triple bond to double bond with Li/NH3.

3. Ozonolysis to form aldehyde and another group.

4. Hydrolyze to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not certain.

In the end, I'm not entirely confident, but based on the steps, I think option C might be correct because it involves hydrogenation and ozonolysis, which could form the necessary carbonyl groups.

Wait, but earlier confusion about the feasibility of ozonolysis makes me doubt. Maybe the correct answer is option C, but I'm not 100% sure.


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule consists of two cyclohexane rings, one with an aldehyde group and the other connected via a hydroxymethyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group and alkylates it with methyl chloride, forming a propargyl group (cyclohexane–C≡C–CH₃).
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexane–CH₂–CH₂–CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxidizing conditions, likely for oxidizing a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid or a secondary alcohol to a ketone.

However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group or the aldehyde group is formed. The steps do not align well with the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the triple bond with an ethyl group, forming cyclohexane–C≡C–CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for reducing the triple bond to a double bond or facilitating elimination.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid for workup, possibly hydrolyzing ozonolysis intermediates.

This sequence suggests that the triple bond is converted into a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis. However, it is unclear how the hydroxymethyl group or the aldehyde group is formed in the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the triple bond with a methyl group, forming cyclohexane–C≡C–CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexane–CH₂–CH₂–CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, which typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. However, after step 2, the molecule has a single bond, making ozonolysis inapplicable.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation.

The sequence is problematic because ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after step 2. This makes the sequence inconsistent with the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group, but methanol is a poor electrophile, making the alkylation step unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for reducing the triple bond or facilitating elimination.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid for workup.

The sequence is unclear, as the first step does not clearly explain how the ethynyl group is modified. Additionally, the steps do not align well with the formation of the hydroxymethyl group or the aldehyde group.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the formation of the target molecule. However, **Option C** is the most plausible because it involves alkylation and hydrogenation, which could set up the molecule for further transformations to form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups. Despite the inconsistency with ozonolysis, it is the closest match to the target structure.
