Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about meson resonance decay. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters, so I need to calculate the decay length and see which option matches.

Hmm, I remember that the decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that Γ * τ ≈ ħ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Or is there a factor I'm missing? Oh, right, in particle physics, Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should make sure about the units. The width Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. The Planck constant ħ is in units of J·s. So I need to convert Γ into J to make the units compatible.

First, let's get the numbers straight. Γ_X is 320 MeV. Let's convert that to GeV for consistency. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. But maybe I should work in SI units. 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J/eV = ... let me calculate that.

320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 320 * 1.602e-13 = 512.64e-13 J. So Γ ≈ 5.1264e-11 J.

Wait, but maybe I should use energy in natural units where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm. Wait, that's another approach. Because I know that in particle physics, people often use natural units where ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm. So maybe I can use that to find the lifetime τ.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the velocity first. The velocity v can be found using the energy of the particle. The production energy E is 8 GeV, and the rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). Let's compute γ.

Wait, but if I'm using units where c=1, then E = γ m. But I'll have to manage the units carefully.

Actually, perhaps the better way is to compute the velocity beta (β = v/c) using the energy. The relativistic energy formula is E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)². But since E_X is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², because in natural units (c=1), m_X is 1.2 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

First, find the lifetime τ. Since τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert Γ into seconds.

Wait, Γ is the total decay width. So:

Γ = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So Γ = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 320 * 1.602e-13 J. Let me compute that:

320 * 1.602 = 512.64, so 512.64e-13 J. So Γ ≈ 5.1264e-11 J.

Now, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So τ = ħ / Γ = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ≈ (1.05457 / 5.1264) * 1e-24 s.

Calculating 1.05457 / 5.1264 ≈ 0.2056. So τ ≈ 0.2056e-24 s = 2.056e-25 s.

Wait, that seems really short. Is that correct? Because for particles with large decay widths, the lifetime is short. Since Γ is 320 MeV, which is a large width, so τ should be small. So perhaps that's correct. Okay.

Next, find the velocity v. Since the particle is moving with energy E, which is 8 GeV, and its rest mass is 1.2 GeV/c². Let's compute beta (β = v/c) using relativistic equations.

The energy E is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Rearranging, p² c² = E² - (m c²)². Then, p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2 ) ) / c.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, this equation simplifies. So in those units, E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV. Let's compute that: 8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. So 64 -1.44 = 62.56. sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Then, beta is v/c = (p c)/E. Hmm, because p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c².

Wait, beta is (v/c) = (pc)/(E). Because p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c². So p c = gamma m v c², and E = gamma m c². So (p c) / E = v c² / c² = v/c = beta.

So beta = (p c) / E.

Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so beta = p / E.

Since p is 7.91 GeV and E is 8 GeV, beta = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875.

So v = beta c ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now compute the decay length L = v * tau.

Tau is 2.056e-25 seconds. So:

L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-25 s = (2.966 * 2.056) * 1e-17 m.

Multiply 2.966 by 2.056. Let's see: 3 * 2 is 6, so perhaps around 6.1? Let me compute more accurately.

2.966 * 2.056:

Calculating 2 * 2.966 = 5.932. 0.056 * 2.966 = approx 0.1653. So total is 5.932 + 0.1653 = 6.0973. So approximately 6.097e-17 m.

Wait, but wait, that's 6.097e-17 meters, which is 6.097e-17 m. Looking at the options, none of them seem to match this. The options are A) 5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.

Wait, did I make a mistake in calculation? Because the result I got is 6e-17 m, which isn't any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the lifetime. Let me recheck that.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let's compute Γ in J.

320 MeV = 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 320 * 1.602e-13 = 512.64e-13 J → 5.1264e-11 J.

Planck's constant ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So tau is ħ / Γ = 1.05457e-34 / 5.1264e-11.

Let me compute 1.05457e-34 /5.1264e-11.

That's (1.05457 /5.1264) * 1e-23. 1.05457/5.1264 is approximately 0.2056.

So 0.2056e-23 s = 2.056e-24 s. Wait wait, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me redo this:

1.05457e-34 divided by 5.1264e-11.

Which is (1.05457 /5.1264) * 1e-34 +11 = (0.2056) * 1e-23 = 2.056e-24 seconds.

Ah, I see what I did wrong earlier. I think I had an extra exponent. So tau is 2.056e-24 seconds, not 2.056e-25. That changes things.

So with tau = 2.056e-24 s, and v = 2.966e8 m/s.

Then L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056) * 1e-16 m.

Wait, because 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16.

So 2.966 * 2.056 is approximately 6.097 as before. So L ≈ 6.097e-16 m.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 5.0223e-16 m. Hmm. That's not matching. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should use another approach. Maybe using the decay length formula with the formula involving the mean lifetime, velocity, but perhaps I can calculate it using natural units to avoid confusion.

Let's think again. Decay length L = c * tau * beta. Because L is v * tau, and v = beta c.

So L = beta c tau.

Tau is ħ / (Gamma) → but using natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, maybe using natural units could help. Let me try that approach.

First, Gamma is 320 MeV. So tau in natural units is ħ / Gamma → but in units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So tau = (ħ c)/(Gamma c) ) → because ħ c is in MeV fm, Gamma is in MeV, so tau in seconds would be (197.33 MeV fm) / (Gamma (MeV)) → but wait, units might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute tau in units of fm/c.

Wait, let's compute tau in natural units first. tau (s) = (ħ / Gamma) → but using ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm. So ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

Gamma is 320 MeV.

Tau = ħ / Gamma = (197.33 MeV fm / c) / (320 MeV) ) = (197.33/320) fm / c.

So (197.33 /320) ≈ 0.616656 fm / c.

But wait, tau is in units of time. So tau = (hbar) / Gamma. But when working in natural units where c=1 and hbar is in MeV s, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula that relates decay length to the particle's lifetime, speed, and energy. Wait, I think another approach is using L = c * gamma * beta * tau. Because L = v * tau = beta c * tau.

And gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²) → but since we're working in natural units, gamma is E/m. So in this case, gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, so gamma is approximately 6.6667.

So tau = ħ / Gamma → which in natural units (where ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm), Gamma is in MeV, so:

tau = (197.33 MeV fm) / (Gamma (MeV) c) ) → but since c=1 in natural units, tau = 197.33 / Gamma fm.

Gamma is 320 MeV → so tau = 197.33 / 320 ≈ 0.616656 fm.

Wait, but tau is in units of time, so how to convert that to seconds? Because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, and 1 second is 1e0 seconds.

Wait, perhaps better to compute in terms of meters. Let's see:

In natural units, c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So to convert from fm to meters,
