Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 meters or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The uncertainty principle, right? The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, the units must be consistent here.

But wait, the mean decay distance isn't just lifetime multiplied by speed, right? Because the particle would be moving when it decays. So the mean distance L is the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

But how do I find the velocity of the meson X? Oh, right, because it has a certain energy, I can use the relativistic energy equations. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. 

So, the relativistic energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Let me rearrange that. 

E² = (p² c²) + (m² c^4). So, p² c² = E² - (m c²)^2. 

Wait, but E and m are both in GeV. I need to make sure to handle the units correctly. Also, I know that the momentum p is related to the velocity via p = gamma m v, but maybe it's easier to find the velocity from the energy.

Wait, another approach: The energy can be expressed in terms of the rest mass and the gamma factor. E = gamma * m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). Wait, but I have to be careful with units here.

Wait, let's think about units. Let me convert everything to SI units, perhaps. Because I need to find the distance in meters, so probably better to have everything in meters, kilograms, seconds, etc.

Let me see: E_X = 8 GeV = 8e9 e
