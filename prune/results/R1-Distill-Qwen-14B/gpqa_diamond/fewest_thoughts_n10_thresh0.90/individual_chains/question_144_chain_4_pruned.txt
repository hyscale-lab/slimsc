Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay, right? The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so I'm guessing I need to calculate the decay length somehow.

Wait, decay length. I think the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like decay length L = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, and β is the velocity divided by the speed of light (v/c).

But how do I find τ? I think the lifetime is connected to the particle's width through the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime τ would be roughly ħ/(Γ). But wait, is it Γ or Γ/2? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think for a resonance, the width Γ is the full width, so the uncertainty in energy is Γ, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Let me double-check that. Yeah, I remember that τ = ħ/(Γ), so that part should be correct.

But wait, there's relativistic effects because the meson is moving at a high speed. Oh right, because the lifetime we just calculated is the proper lifetime (τ), but from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The time dilation factor is gamma, which is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to E/(m c²), but wait, no, more accurately, gamma is E/(rest energy). So E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). Oh wait, but units might be tricky here since energy is given in GeV and mass in GeV/c².

Wait, I need to be careful with units. Let's think about the velocity beta. Beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). Alternatively, gamma can be expressed as E/(m c²), but perhaps it's easier to calculate beta from the energy and mass.

The total energy E is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass energy is m_X c². Oh, wait, the mass is given as m_X = 1.2 GeV/c². Because when energy is written in GeV, mass in GeV/c², and E is total energy which includes kinetic plus rest mass energy. So E = gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). Since m is 1.2 GeV/c², E/(m c²) becomes (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Now, beta can be found from gamma. The relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So I can rearrange to find beta. Let me calculate that.

Gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6667. So 1/gamma² = 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - beta² ≈ 1/(gamma²) → beta squared is 1 - 1/(gamma squared) → 1 - (1/(6.6667)^2) → 1 - (1/44.4444) ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, 6.6667 squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/gamma² is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - beta² = 1/gamma² → beta² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Hmm, that's a high beta, which makes sense because the energy is much larger than the rest mass.

So now, back to the decay length. Decay length L = c * tau * beta. Let's compute each part.

First, tau is the proper lifetime, which is h-bar divided by the width. The width Γ is 320 MeV. Let me make sure about the units. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV·s is a very small unit. So ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert it to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that
