Okay, I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. It's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

The given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (w) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are A, B, C, D with different momentum values.

Hmm. So, I think this has to do with transitions between energy states in a diatomic molecule. Since it's a rotation-vibration model, I should probably consider both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the next higher energy state. But I'm a bit confused about what exactly is considered the next state. Maybe it's the first excited state, which could involve either a change in vibrational or rotational energy.

Wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (possibly J=0, but some models might consider J=1 as the lowest if J=0 is not allowed due to symmetry, like in diatomic molecules). But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational quantum number J can be 0,1,2,... but for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so the rotational energy might depend on the vibrational state as well. Hmm, but maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can treat rotation and vibration separately as they are in the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models, respectively?

Wait, the problem says it's using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, I think that model includes both rotation and vibration, but perhaps the exact treatment is a bit more complex
