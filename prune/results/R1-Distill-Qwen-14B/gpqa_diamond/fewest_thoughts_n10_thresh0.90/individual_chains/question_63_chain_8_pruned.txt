Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms connected by a bond, and their movement can be thought of in terms of rotation and vibration. 

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. We're supposed to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh wait, so the next state would be the first excited state. 

The given data includes masses of the atoms X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are four different momenta.

I need to figure out what transition the molecule undergoes when it absorbs a photon. Since it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, I think that the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states. 

Wait, in the quantum mechanical model for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to a higher state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the next vibrational state, since vibrational transitions are higher in energy than rotational ones. Or maybe a rotational transition within the same vibrational state. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model. The energy levels for vibration are given by E_vibrational = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. For rotation, the energy is E_rotational = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But B depends on the moment of inertia, which is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

In the fundamental state, the molecule would be in v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be either v=1 (so the vibrational state increases by one) or J=1 (rotational state increases). Since the vibrational energy levels are higher, a transition to v=1 would require a higher energy photon than a transition to J=1. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, but wait, the energy of the next state would be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which of these has lower energy?

The energy for v=1, J=0 would be E = (1 + 1/2) h w + 0 (since J=0). The energy for v=0, J=1 would be E = (0 + 1/2) h w + B * 1*(1+1) = (1/2 h w) + 2B. So which is lower? It depends on the values of h w and B.

Alternatively, wait, the question is about the next state with the "lowest possible energy" among the higher states. So the first excited state would be the one with the least energy increase from the ground state.

So perhaps the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or rotational state. The energy difference for the vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) would be ΔE_vib = h w. The energy difference for the rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) would be ΔE_rot = 2B. So if h w is larger than 2B, then the rotational transition would be lower in energy difference. So the photon needed would be the one corresponding to the smaller energy difference. 

But wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we're looking for the photon that allows it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the next state is the lowest possible state above the fundamental state. So the photon must provide the energy difference between the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) and the next state, which could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever has a lower energy.

Alternatively, wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first state. The next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the next lowest energy level. So perhaps the question is about the transition where the molecule goes from the ground state to the first excited state, which is the next possible energy level, not necessarily the next higher in any particular mode.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about how the energy levels are structured. The energy levels are quantized and can be thought of as a combination of vibrational and rotational energy. So each state is labeled by (v, J). The energy for each state is E(v,J) = E_vibrational(v) + E_rotational(J).

E_vibrational(v) = (v + 1/2) h w.

E_rotational(J) = B J (J+1), where B = h/(8 π² c I), and I is the moment of inertia.

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ R². μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms, right?

So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). The masses are given in amu, so I need to convert them to kilograms.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So:

Mx =20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My=2*1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 )

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So Mx + My = 22 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) /22 amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

But amu to kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that.

1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.023, so 3.023e-27 kg.

Wait, but let me get more precise.

Compute μ:

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) amu.

20*2=40, 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.8181
