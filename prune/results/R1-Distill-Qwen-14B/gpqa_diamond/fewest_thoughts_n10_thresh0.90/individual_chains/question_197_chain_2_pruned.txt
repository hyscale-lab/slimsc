Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on IR and NMR data and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region, probably O-H stretches. Wait, that's a big range. Oh, maybe it includes both alcohols and carboxylic acids. Because alcohols have O-H around 3300-3500, and carboxylic acids are broader, maybe around 2500-3300. There's also a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Where else do I see that? Carboxylic acids have C=O around 1700, maybe a bit higher. Also, 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are probably aromatic ring vibrations, maybe C=C stretching.

Looking at the NMR next. The 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which could be an -OH proton. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be around 10-12 ppm. Or maybe an alcohol, but the IR suggested O-H, but I'm not sure yet.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons as doublets. So maybe para-substituted benzene. Like two protons on either side of substituents.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons. So probably two substituents, maybe in para positions. So the aromatic ring is probably 1,4-disubstituted.

Then the other peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe near a carbonyl. Like a CH next to a carbonyl group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe adjacent to a CH group. Also, perhaps part of a chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet? Wait, a doublet. Oh, wait, the integration is 3H, and it's a doublet. That's probably a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is next to another group. Like a (CH2)CH3 group. Wait, maybe a CH(CH2CH3) structure? Or perhaps a branching.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, probably a terminal CH3. So that's likely part of an ethyl or longer chain. So maybe something like -CH2CH2CH3, but the 0.9 triplet would be the end.

Putting this together. Let's see. The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. So two substituents in the para positions. Looking at the options, let me check:

Options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Structure would be benzene ring with an ethyl group in position 4 (since it's 2-substituted in the propanoic acid. Wait, maybe not. Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the phenyl group attached to the second carbon of the propanoic acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So if it's 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, the structure would be benzene ring with an ethyl group in position 4, attached to the second carbon of the propanoic acid.

Wait, but the NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, which is likely the -COOH proton. So if it's a carboxylic acid, then that makes sense.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid would have a substituent in the para position. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's see. The benzoic acid would have a structure where the COOH is at position 1, and in position 4, there's a sec-butyl group.

What's a sec-butyl group? It's CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something else? Wait, wait. Wait, the sec-butyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, butyl groups are either straight chain (n-butyl) or branched (sec-butyl or iso-butyl). So the structure would be:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at position 4. If it's a sec-butyl group, that would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, but let's check the NMR.

If compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the benzoic acid would have a COOH group, which would explain the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR peak (carbonyl) and the 10.5 ppm NMR (COOH proton).

The aromatic protons would be in a para substitution. So in the NMR, the downfield regions are 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H), which fits with a para-substituted ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and split into two doublets, typically.

So the aromatic region makes sense for a para-substituted benzoic acid.

Now, the other peaks in the NMR: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H).

Let me draw the structure. The benzoic acid has the COOH group. The substituent in position 4 is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait: sec-butyl is actually -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- but wait, no. Wait, butyl groups have four carbons. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, perhaps I should better think of it. The substituent is a butyl group attached to the ring. So for a sec-butyl group, the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Wait, the butyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the substitution depends on where the branch is.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon chain where the branching is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. Wait, but how many carbons? Let me count: the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is (CH2)2CHCH3? Wait, no. Wait, butyl is four carbons. So, the substituent is in the position where the branching is on the second carbon.

Wait, the structure would be: -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a three-carbon chain with a methyl branch. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons.

Wait, maybe the structure is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that's only three carbons. Oh, right, wait, no: butyl is four carbons. So, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)
