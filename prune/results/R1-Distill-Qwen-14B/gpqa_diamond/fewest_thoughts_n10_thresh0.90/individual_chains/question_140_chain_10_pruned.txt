Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a reaction involving Substance X. It says that X reacts violently with liquid Y, producing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C. So B must be a solid that melts just above freezing. Hmm, maybe something like ice? But wait, ice melts at 273 K, so 277 K is a bit higher. Or maybe another compound?

Next, the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and Substance X contains two atoms of oxygen. Also, Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Oh, wait, the question is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. And if there are multiple instances, sum all heavier and lighter isotopes. Oh, wait, no, the question says considering that if multiple instances exist, all heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed. So I need to sum the masses for each element present in X, but wait, no, it says the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So for each element in X, find the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their masses, and then add them together for each element, and then add all those sums for each element in X? Or wait, maybe it's the lightest and heaviest elements in X, meaning the smallest atomic number and the largest, and sum their atomic masses. I'm a bit confused on that point.

Let me try to figure out what Substance X is. The reaction with liquid Y is violent, so maybe it's a reaction like a metal reacting with an acid. Since Y is a liquid, perhaps it's an acid like sulfuric or hydrochloric. The product gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Let's see, if the molecule has equal protons and neutrons.

For example, hydrogen gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not equal. Next, maybe CO2? No, carbon has 6 protons, 8 neutrons (assuming it's the most common isotope). O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. Wait, for CO2, each CO2 molecule has 6+8*2 = 22 protons, and the number of neutrons would be (6 neutrons from C) + (16 from each O, so 32) total neutrons. No, but the question says the gas has the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. So the total protons in the molecule should equal the total neutrons.

Wait, for example, if the molecule is CH4, it has 6 protons (C) + 4*(1) = 10 protons. Each CH4 molecule has 6 (C's neutrons) + 4*(2 from each H? No, wait, H is 1 proton, but 0 neutrons. Wait, no, wait, H can have isotopes. Wait, but the problem says W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for CH4, 10 protons, and 6 neutrons (from C), but H has 0. So total neutrons would be 6. So 10 protons, 6 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait another example: O2. Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits. So W could be O2 gas? But then, O2 is a diatomic gas. So the reaction would produce O2. Alternatively, maybe another molecule. Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, if W is H2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Or maybe it's a different molecule. Hmm. Another thought: the gas could be something like NH3. Let's see, N is 7 protons, H is 1. So NH3 has 7 + 3*1 =10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (since N is usually ^14N with 7 protons and 7 neutrons?), so 7 for N. H has 0. So total neutrons would be 7. 10 vs 7. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe CO. C has 6 protons, O has 8, so CO has 14 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (assuming ^12C is 6 neutrons?), O has 8. So 6 +8 =14 neutrons. So 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That works. So CO would fit. But wait, CO is a gas, but it's not very common in reactions like this. Alternatively, maybe O3 (ozone)? O3 would have 3 O atoms. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O3 has 24 protons and 24 neutrons. That also fits.

Hmm, but maybe I should think about the reaction first. So Substance X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W, precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. Then, B's melting point is close to 277 K. So 277 K is about 4°C. So B could be a substance that's solid just above freezing. Water freezes at 273 K. So maybe B is ice? But ice melts at 273, but if B is close to that, perhaps it's another solid. Alternatively, maybe B is something like NaOH, but that's a solid but not near 277 K.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction of X with Y produces a metal hydroxide. Let me think, if Y is an acid. Suppose X is a metal, and Y is an acid. Then the reaction could be a metal reacting with an acid to produce hydrogen gas. But earlier, I thought W could be O2, but that doesn't fit if it's a metal reacting with an acid. Wait, no, if X is a metal, Y could be a strong acid, and the reaction produces H2 gas. But wait, earlier I thought W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So 2 vs 0. Doesn't fit. So perhaps W isn't H2.

Wait, maybe the gas is another molecule. Let's think, perhaps it's O2. If so, then in the reaction, Y could be water, but that's a liquid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between an alkali metal and water. For example, sodium reacting with water produces hydrogen gas. But that's H2, which doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, maybe Y is not an acid but something else. Let's think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, G precipitates, and upon heating, it gives B. So perhaps G is a metal hydroxide, which upon heating becomes a metal oxide. For example, if X is sodium (Na), Y is water. Then perhaps the reaction is Na + H2O → NaOH (which is soluble, so that might not precipitate). Alternatively, perhaps Y is a salt solution. Or maybe Y is something else.

Wait, another angle: The product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So when the keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think about possible reactions. Keto acids are like acetic acid, which is CH3COOH. Reacting with a strong base like NaOH would produce a salt and water. But if X is a base, then the product would have more oxygens. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: X could be sodium (Na), a metal. So when sodium reacts with water, it produces NaOH and H2 gas. So W is H2, which doesn't fit the neutron and proton condition. Alternatively, maybe X
