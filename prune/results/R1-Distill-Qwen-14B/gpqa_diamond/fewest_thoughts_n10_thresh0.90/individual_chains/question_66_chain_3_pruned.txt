Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries exactly?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because all the Standard Model (SM) interactions are Lorentz invariant. So any operator added in SMEFT should also preserve that. Because if they didn't, it would imply new dynamics at lower energies, which isn't how effective theories work. So Lorentz symmetry is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh right, because the SM is built on a Minkowski spacetime, which is translation invariant. So all SM terms must respect Poincare. But wait, are the SMEFT operators automatically Poincare invariant? Because the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which should respect the same symmetries as the SM. So yes, all operators should respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, Poincare is a larger symmetry group that includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. So the question is, is Poincare a separate requirement or implied by Lorentz.

Hmm, but the question lists them as separate options. So I need to think, do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? I think yes, because the effective theory is valid only in the low-energy limit where these symmetries hold. So both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people refer to Poincare as including all the symmetries of the SM, including translations. So operators must have the same symmetries as the SM, including Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Then, what about CP symmetry? I'm not so sure. The Standard Model itself doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then does SMEFT have to? I don't think so. SMEFT includes all possible operators, which might include those violating CP, provided that the SM already has CP violation. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the combination of C, P, and T transformations must be a symmetry due to the properties of Lorentz transformations. So if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. So CPT symmetry is automatically respected. So 4 must be obeyed.

Putting it all together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. Wait, but wait, I thought Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. So 1 and 2 are both required. So the correct options would be 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4, and option A is 1,2. So which is correct? Wait, Poincare symmetry is more than just Lorentz; it includes translations and other stuff. So if an operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. But the question is, which symmetries must be respected. So I think all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a superset? So if you have Poincare symmetry, you automatically have Lorentz. So the correct answer must include both 1 and 2.

Wait, but the options have 1,2,4 as option C. So the question is, do all SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare and Lorentz? I think yes, because they're part of the underlying structure. So the correct symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So option C is 1,2,4, which would be the correct choice.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM. The SM is Poincare invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must be a Poincare-invariant operator. Therefore, yes, they must respect Poincare symmetry. So 1 and 2 are both required. But are 1 and 2 separate? Because Poincare implies Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it's automatically respecting Lore
