Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. 

Wait, so first, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium normally has 3 protons because the atomic number is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of about... I think the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But wait, maybe I should look up the exact value. Oh wait, in exams, sometimes standard masses are used, like 1 u is about 1.66e-27 kg. But perhaps there's a formula I can use without the exact mass.

The energy in question is the total energy, I assume. Since the nucleus is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects matter. So I'll need to calculate the total energy using the relativistic energy formula.

The formula for total energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, and v is 0.96c here.

So first, compute gamma. Let me plug in the numbers. v =0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c². Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1-0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714? Wait, 0.28 times 3.571 is about 1, since 0.28 *3 is 0.84, 0.28*3.571≈1. So yeah, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let's do it more accurately. Let me calculate 1/(sqrt(0.0784)). So sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(784e-4) which is 28e-2, which is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so its rest mass is 6 u. But wait, the exact value of 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. So m0 c² is 5.589 GeV.

Then, the total energy E is gamma * m0 c². So 3.5714 *5.589 GeV. Let me calculate that. 3.5714 *5 Gev is 17.857 GeV. 3.5714 * 0.589 GeV. Wait, let me compute 3.5714 *5.589:

Wait
