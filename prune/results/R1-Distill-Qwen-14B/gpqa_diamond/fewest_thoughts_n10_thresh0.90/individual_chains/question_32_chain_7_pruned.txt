Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the nucleus so that its speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that relativistic physics comes into play here because the speed is a significant fraction of c, so I can't just use classical mechanics. 

Wait, the nucleus is given as X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think, lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6. So the mass of the nucleus is approximately the mass of a Li-6 atom. But wait, in reality, the mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy, but I think for this problem, we can approximate it as the mass of the atom divided by the number of protons and neutrons? Or maybe we can just use the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. Wait, no, the nucleus itself is a single particle. So for a Li-6 nucleus, the mass is about 6 nucleons. So perhaps I should find the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, the mass number A is 6, so the mass of the nucleus is approximately 6 times the mass of a nucleon. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same as a neutron. So each nucleon is around 938 MeV/c². So the total rest mass of the nucleus would be 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me calculate that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV/c². 

Wait, but wait. The actual mass of a Li-6 atom is a bit more than 6 nucleons because the electrons contribute, right? Or wait, no, the nucleus itself doesn't include electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is the mass of the atom minus the electrons. Hmm, but maybe for this purpose, since the nucleus is being accelerated, we're considering its rest mass as the sum of its constituent nucleons. So perhaps the mass is approximately 6 * 938 MeV/c². 

But wait, another point: the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually slightly less than 6 nucleons because the binding energy. But maybe the problem expects us to ignore that and just use 6 times the nucleon mass. So I'll proceed with that assumption.

Now, the energy of the particle in a collider is given by the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

v = 0.96c. So beta is 0.96. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So that's 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²). Let me calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96: 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is approximately 0.28, because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, more accurately, let's calculate it. 0.0784 is 784/10000. The square root is sqrt(784/10000) = 28/100 = 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

So the total energy E is gamma * m c². The rest mass energy m c² is 6 * 938 MeV, which is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. So E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5 GeV is 17.857 GeV. 3.5714 * 0.628 GeV: Let's compute 0.628 * 3.5714.

Breaking it down:

0.6 * 3.5714 = 2.14284

0.028 * 3.5714 ≈ 0.099999 ≈ 0.1

So adding them, 2.14284 + 0.1 = 2.24284 GeV.

So total E is 17.857 + 2.24284 ≈ 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but that's a rough calculation. Let me get a more precise figure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute 3.5714 multiplied by 5.628 GeV.

First, 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857

3.5714 * 0.628 = ?

Compute 3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 * 0.028 = 0.100 (approx)

So 2.14284 + 0.100 = 2.24284

So total E is 17.857 + 2.24284 = 20.09984 GeV, which rounds to approximately 20.10 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, my rough calculation gives around 20.1 GeV. So option C is 20.132, which is close.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the mass. Because the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is not exactly 6 times the nucleon mass. Let me double-check.

The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So each has about 938-940 MeV. The average is around 938. Let me compute the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons minus the binding energy. But the binding energy for Li-6 is about 6 MeV (I think), leading to a mass deficit. However, for the purpose of this problem, maybe the exact value isn't required, and the problem expects me to use the rest mass as 6 times the nucleon mass. But perhaps the actual approach is to consider the mass of a Li-6 atom, which includes electrons, but in a nucleus, the electrons are separate. So perhaps the mass is just 6 nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as the average of the individual particles. Wait, but perhaps the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 5.628 GeV/c². Wait, let me think: 6 nucleons, each about 938 MeV, so 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV. So that's consistent.

Wait, but perhaps I should look up the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Let me think, I might remember that the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 5.628 GeV/c². But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the given parameters.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the fact that the nucleus is being treated as a particle with mass m = 6 * m_n (neutron mass) or m_p, but either way, perhaps to a first approximation, it's 6 * 938 MeV.

So going back to E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately. 3.5714 * 5.628.

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857.

3.5714 * 0.628 = ?

Compute 3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 * 0.028 = 0.100 (exactly, 3.5714 * 0.028 = 0.100 (since 3.5714 * 0.02 = 0.071428; 3.5714 * 0.008 = 0.0285712; adding gives 0.0999992≈0.1 )

So 2.14284 + 0.1 = 2.24284.

So 17.857 + 2.24284 = 20.09984 GeV. So approximately 20.10 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the exact calculation would be a bit higher. Maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, let's recalculate gamma. Let's compute the exact value.

v = 0.96c.

Beta = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784).

What's sqrt(0.0784)?

Well, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.571428571.

So that's correct.

Now, 25/7 multiplied by 5.628 GeV.

Wait, 5.628 GeV is 5628 MeV.

Wait, wait, perhaps the nucleus is actually a deuteron or something else, but no, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6.

So, let me compute 5.628 GeV * 3.571428571.

5.628 * 3.571428571.

Let me compute 5 * 3.571428571 = 17.857142855.

0.628 * 3.571428571.

Let me compute 0.628 * 3.571428571.

Compute 3.571428571 * 0.6 = 2.1428571426

3.571428571 * 0.028 = 0.100 (exactly, 3.571428571 * 0.028 = 0.100 (since 3.571428571 * 0.02 = 0.0714285714; 3.571428571 * 0.008 = 0.028571428568; adding them gives 0.099999999968 ≈ 0.1 )

So 2.1428571426 + 0.1 = 2.2428571426.

Adding to 17.857142855, gives 20.0999999976 GeV, which is approximately 20.100 GeV.

But wait, the options don't have exactly 20.10. Option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check.

Wait, maybe the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is not exactly 6 * 938 MeV. Let me think, because each proton and neutron have slightly different masses.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is 939.565 MeV/c². So the mass of Li-6 nucleus is 3 protons + 3 neutrons.

So 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = ?

3 * 938.272 = 2,814.816 MeV

3 * 939.565 = 2,818.695 MeV

Total: 2,814.816 + 2,818.695 = 5,633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

Ah, okay, so the rest mass is 5.6335 GeV/c², not 5.628 GeV as I initially thought.

So that's a more accurate figure. So E = gamma * m c² = (25/7) * 5.6335 GeV.

Compute 25/7 = 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute 5.6335 multiplied by 3.57142857.

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285

0.6335 *3.57142857:

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.142857142

0.0335 *3.57142857 = let's compute 3.57142857 *0.03 = 0.1071428571; 3.57142857 *0.0035=0.0125000000. So total 0.1071428571 + 0.0125 = 0.1196428571.

Adding 2.142857142 + 0.1196428571 = 2.2625000.

So total E is 17.85714285 +2.2625 =20.11964285 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1196 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the precise calculation gives about 20.12 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the gamma calculation. Wait, no, I think 25/7 is exact for beta=0.96.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the exact value of gamma, which might not be exactly 3.57142857 due to more precise beta calculation.

Wait, beta is 0.96 exactly, so yes, gamma is exactly 25/7.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is different. Let me think, perhaps the actual mass is about 5.616 GeV/c².

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should look for the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy equation with the given parameters, so perhaps the calculation is correct, and the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 3.57142857 *5.6335.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6335.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6335 = ?

Breaking it down:

0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.142857142

0.03 *3.57142857 =0.1071428571

0.0035*3.57142857 =0.0125000000.

So 2.142857142 +0.1071428571=2.250000, plus 0.0125 is 2.2625.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.2625=20.11964285 GeV.

So approximately 20.1196 GeV. So option C is 20.132, which is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0
