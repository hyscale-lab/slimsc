Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. Let me take a deep breath and think this through step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given information includes the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about activity coefficients or other factors here.

Wait, what do I remember about EDTA and its complexes? EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability of these complexes is often described by formation constants (Kf). A high Kf means the complex is very stable, so the metal is tightly bound.

In this case, the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is CaY^2-, I think. Since it's stoichiometric, that means the ratio of Ca^2+ to EDTA^4- is 1:1. So when it dissociates, it'll release Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions into the solution.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10. Wait, but in some cases, I've seen the dissociation constant Kd used. Oh right, Kd is the inverse of Kf. Because Kf is the formation constant: Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). So the dissociation would be the reverse reaction, so Kd = 1/Kf. Let me compute that first.

Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. So Kd is 2e-11.

Now, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of CaY^2- as C, which is 0.02 M. When this complex dissociates, let's say it dissociates to x concentration of Ca^2+ and x concentration of EDTA^4-.

So, the dissociation equation is: CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

At equilibrium, the concentrations would be:
[CaY^2-] = C - x ≈ C (since x is probably very small compared to C),
[Ca^2+] = x,
[EDTA^4-] = x.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second, that's only if the complex doesn't dissociate much. Given that Kd is 2e-11, which is a very small number, the dissociation is minimal. So x will be much smaller than 0.02 M, so we can approximate [CaY^2-] as about 0.02 M.

So putting these into the Kd equation:

Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [CaY^2-]
=> 2e-11 = (x)(x) / 0.02
=> 2e-11 = x² / 0.02

Solving for x²: x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13
So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute that. Wait, 4e-13 is 4*(1e-13), the square root is sqrt(4)=2, and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5 since sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5 (because 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2). So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca^2+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M, which matches this value. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check my steps. I started with Kf, which is the formation constant, so Kd is 1/Kf. Correct. Then wrote the expression, assumed x is small compared to 0.02 M, which makes sense because Kd is so small. The math seems right: x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7. Yep, that's correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation constant \( K_d \), which is the inverse of the formation constant \( K_f \). Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:
- \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since dissociation is minimal),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

Using the expression for \( K_d \):

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]},
\]

we substitute the known values:

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
