Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the conditions are such that the EDTA is fully deprotonated, so it can form the complex with Ca²+ ions. The temperature is 25°C, which I guess is standard, but I don't think that affects the calculation directly. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to find the correct concentration of calcium ions.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formula for the formation constant, Kf, is given by Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Wait, but wait, if the solution is already the Ca-EDTA complex, then I think the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M.

But wait, the problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions. Because EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+, the free [Ca²+] would be very low, right? So I think I need to find [Ca²+] in the solution.

Let me think about the formation constant expression. Kf is a very large number, which suggests that the complex is very stable. So most of the EDTA and Ca²+ would be tied up in the complex.

The formula I should use is Kf = [Complex]/([Metal][Ligand]). In this case, the complex is CaEDTA²−, so [Complex] is 0.02 M.

Assuming that the EDTA is in excess and all the Ca²+ is complexed, but wait, no, because the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, but EDTA is usually in excess when used as a ligand, but in this case, the problem states the complex is 0.02 M. So maybe the EDTA is present in such a way that it's all complexed with Ca²+? Or perhaps I should consider the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, the formation of the complex is given by Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−. So the Kf is very large, indicating the reaction goes almost to completion. So [Ca²+] would be very small.

But the problem is, the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−. So that's the concentration of the complex. So the initial assumption is that [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M.

So, if Kf is 5e10, then:

Kf = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] )

I need to find [Ca²+], but I don't know [EDTA^4−]. Wait, but in solution, EDTA is present in different protonated forms. But earlier, the problem states that the pH is ideal. I think this implies that EDTA is entirely in the Y^4− form because EDTA's pKa values are such that at a certain pH (like around 10), it's fully deprotonated. So we can assume [EDTA^4−] is present, and perhaps that's the case here.

Wait, but if the solution is the Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is ideal, then the EDTA is in the Y^4− form. Therefore, the concentration of EDTA^4− would be equal to the concentration of the complex minus the free EDTA? No, wait, the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the total EDTA (both free and complexed) would be [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4−] + [CaEDTA²−].

But wait, in the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. So the EDTA_total would be [EDTA^4−] + 0.02 M. But without knowing the initial amount of EDTA added, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is ideal (so Y^4− is dominant), then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA²−] as 0.02 M.

Then, Kf = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−] )

I need to find [Ca²+], but I have two variables: [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−]. Hmm, but perhaps another equation comes from the total EDTA in solution. Wait, but the problem doesn't give the total concentration of EDTA, only the concentration of the complex. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider that all the EDTA is tied up in the complex. But that can't be right because then [EDTA^4−] would be zero, making Kf undefined. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is such that the majority of the EDTA is in the complex, but some is free. But without more information, I might need to make an assumption. Maybe the concentration of EDTA^4− is much lower than 0.02 M, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the concentration of EDTA^4− is equal to the concentration of free EDTA in solution. But without knowing the initial concentration of EDTA, it's tricky.

Wait a second, perhaps this is a problem where we're told to assume that the concentration of free EDTA is negligible compared to the complex. So then, [EDTA^4−] can be approximated as (something). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express [Ca²+] in terms of the given Kf and the concentration of the complex.

Wait, let me write the Kf equation again:

Kf = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] )

We can rearrange this to solve for [Ca²+]:

[Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²−] / ( Kf * [EDTA^4−] )

Hmm, but without knowing [EDTA^4−], I can't find [Ca²+] directly.

Wait, but perhaps I can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4− is much smaller than the concentration of the complex. Or perhaps, the total EDTA in solution is much less than the concentration of the complex. Wait, no, because the complex is formed from EDTA and Ca²+.

Alternatively, maybe the concentration of EDTA^4− is equal to the concentration of free EDTA. But that doesn't help unless I have more information.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of free EDTA is negligible. So that [EDTA^4−] is approximately equal to [Ca²+], but that doesn't make much sense. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating things.

Wait, another approach: in a solution where the complex is formed, it's often the case that the concentration of free metal ions is extremely low because Kf is so large. So if the complex is 0.02 M and Kf is 5e10, maybe [Ca²+] is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex divided by Kf multiplied by something else.

Wait, if I consider that the concentration of EDTA^4− is equal to the concentration of Ca²+, which might not be correct, but let's see:

Assume [EDTA^4−] = [Ca²+]

Then,

[Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²−] / ( Kf * [EDTA^4−] ) → [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²−]/( Kf * [Ca²+] )

Multiply both sides by Kf [Ca²+]:

[Ca²+]^2 * Kf = [CaEDTA²−]

So,

[Ca²+]^2 = [CaEDTA²−]/ Kf

[Ca²+] = sqrt( [CaEDTA²−]/ Kf )

Plugging in numbers:

[Ca²+] = sqrt(0.02 / (5e10) )

Let me compute that.

0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.

So 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait, I made an assumption that [EDTA^4−] equals [Ca²+]. Is that a valid assumption? Let me think.

In the Kf equation, the denominator is [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]. If both are the same, then [Ca²+]^2. So, that's why I could write [Ca²+]^2 = [CaEDTA²−]/ Kf.

But is the assumption [EDTA^4−] = [Ca²+] correct? Let me think about the EDTA. The total EDTA is the sum of [EDTA^4−] and [CaEDTA²−].

Wait, but the initial EDTA concentration would be [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4−] + [CaEDTA²−]

But the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, so [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. So, [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4−] + 0.02 M.

But without knowing [EDTA_total], I can't find [EDTA^4−] directly. So perhaps the assumption is that [EDTA^4−] is much smaller than the complex concentration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if Kf is so large, then the formation of the complex is nearly complete. That would imply that almost all the EDTA is in the complex form, and the free EDTA is very small. So [EDTA^4−] would be much less than 0.02 M. But in that case, [EDTA^4−] would approach zero, which would make the denominator in Kf very small, but since Kf is large, [Ca²+] would be very small. 

Wait, but if [EDTA^4−] is very small, then [Ca²+] would be [CaEDTA²−]/( Kf * [EDTA^4−] )

If [EDTA^4−] approaches [Ca²+], as I assumed earlier, then we can proceed as before.

But perhaps another approach is to consider that the concentration of free EDTA is equal to the concentration of free Ca²+, because each complex formation releases one Ca²+ and consumes one EDTA^4−. So perhaps [EDTA^4−] = [Ca²+].

But I'm not entirely certain about this. Let me think about the reaction. The reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−.

So for every mole of CaEDTA²− formed, one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4− are consumed. So in equilibrium, the amount of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4− would be the same, assuming they're in stoichiometric proportions.

Wait, but that's only if the reaction is 1:1, which it is. So yes, [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4−] in this case.

So, that assumption is valid. Then, with [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4−], we can write Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+])^2.

So,

[Ca²+]^2 = [CaEDTA²−]/ Kf.

Therefore,

[Ca²+] = sqrt( [CaEDTA²−]/ Kf )

Plugging the numbers:

[Ca²+] = sqrt(0.02 /5e10 )

0.02 is 2e-2.

So,

(2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is approximately 2*(3.16e-7) )= 6.32e-7 M.

That matches option C, which is 6.3e-7 M.

So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant expression for the complex:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

### Key Assumptions:
1. The pH is ideal, meaning EDTA is fully deprotonated to the form \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\).
2. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\).
3. The formation constant is \(K_f = 5 \times 10^{10}\).
4. At equilibrium, the concentrations of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and free EDTA \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) are equal because the reaction is 1:1 (\(\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}\)).

### Simplified Expression:
Using \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\), the formation constant equation becomes:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}]^2}
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\):

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = \sqrt{\frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{K_f}}
\]

### Substitution:
Substitute \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\) and \(K_f = 5 \times 10^{10}\):

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = \sqrt{\frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Take the square root:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Conclusion:
The concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
