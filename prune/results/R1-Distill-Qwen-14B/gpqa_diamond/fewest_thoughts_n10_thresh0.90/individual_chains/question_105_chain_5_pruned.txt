Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. The question is about how the brightness variations caused by these spots compare to those caused by a planet transiting the star. They want to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2. That's because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius, and the brightness we measure is the total light, so blocking more area reduces the light more.

But wait, in this case, it's not a planet causing the dip but starspots. So the star's brightness variation is because different parts of the star are cooler and block more light as the star rotates. Since only one hemisphere is covered, the spots will come into and out of view as the star rotates, causing periodic dips in brightness.

So the first thing I should probably figure out is the total brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the variation caused by a planet and find the planet's radius that would match.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, which means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. Wait, but the hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2), since a hemisphere is half the sphere. Wait, no, wait. The star is a sphere, so the area is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². The filling factor is the fraction of that hemisphere covered in spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of the flux from the star. The star emits flux F = σ T^4. The total flux without any spots is F_total = σ T_eff^4 * 4 π R². But when spots are present, some parts are cooler, so the total flux is reduced.

The spots have a lower temperature, so each spot contributes less flux. The flux from the spots is F_spots = σ (T_spot)^4 * (area of spots).

Similarly, the non-spotted parts of the hemisphere contribute at the higher temperature, but wait, no, the other hemisphere is not spotty. Wait, no, the problem says that only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So the other hemisphere is normal, at 6000 K.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this.

The star's total surface is 4π R². One hemisphere (2π R²) has spots covering 20% of its area. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The remaining part of that hemisphere is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R². The other hemisphere (2π R²) is entirely normal, so all at 6000 K.

So the total flux when spots are on view would be the sum of the flux from each part.

Flux without spots: F_normal = 4π R² * σ (6000)^4.

But when spots are present, the flux is:

F = [ (0.8 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 ] + [ (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 ] + [ 2π
