Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness variations we observe. And then, they want to compare it to the signal from an exoplanet. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. But here, the star itself has spots, so maybe the effect is similar?

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, filling factor of 20%. The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So, the spots are at 5000 K. The star is rotating, so as it spins, the spots come into and go out of view, causing brightness changes. The setup is such that this looks similar to an exoplanet's effect. The question is: what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do?

Wait, so the problem is asking, if the star didn't have spots, what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do. So, the dip from the spots is being treated as a planet's transit.

First, I think I need to calculate the relative brightness change caused by the spots and the planet. The amplitude of the variation is the same for both scenarios, so I can set their contributions equal and solve for the planet's radius.

Let's break it down. The star's brightness without spots would be uniform. But with spots, when they are on the side facing us (the hemisphere), their lower temperature makes the star appear slightly dimmer. So the variation in brightness is due to the spots rotating in and out of view.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots cover a certain fraction of the star's surface as seen from Earth. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. Wait, waitâ€”no, filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface area covered by spots. Oh wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots, but the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere? Or is it 20% of the entire star? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

"One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so perhaps the entire star is a sphere, and one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area covered is 20% of half the star's surface. Wait, no, the filling factor is often the fraction of the entire surface covered. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if one hemisphere is covered, and the filling factor is 20%, that would mean that spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface. Because the hemisphere is half of the star's surface, so 20% of the entire star's surface is in one hemisphere. Alternatively, perhaps the 20% is the coverage within the hemisphere. Wait,
