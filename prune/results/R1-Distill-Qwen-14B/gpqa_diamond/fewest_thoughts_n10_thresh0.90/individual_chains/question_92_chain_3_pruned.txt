Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a complex organic molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the question gives the molecule as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a bicyclic compound or maybe a terpene of some sort. Wait, actually, looking at it, it's a diene, right? Two double bonds maybe? Let me count the carbons. Let's see: each (CH3)2C is a group, and then each CH2 and CH(CH3). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about how many hydrogen and carbon bonds are involved.

The problem gives some bond energies: Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization? That's the energy required to break all bonds in an atom, so for carbon, it's the energy to turn C(s) into gaseous atoms. I remember that in enthalpy of formation calculations, we often use bond energies because the enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

Wait, the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation of this molecule. So the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) = [sum of bond energies of all bonds in the reactants] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds in the products].

But wait, in this case, the reactants are the elements in their standard states. So for a hydrocarbon, that's H2 and O2 or just H2 and C? Wait, no, because the molecule is C and H. Oh wait, the standard state for carbon is graphite (solid), and for hydrogen it's H2 (gas). So when calculating the formation, you compare the bonds in the molecule to the bonds in the elements.

Wait another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in the reactants] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds formed in the products].

But I think the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = sum (bonds broken in reactants) - sum (bonds formed in products).

Alternatively, it's the sum of the energies of the bonds in the reactant molecules minus the sum of the energies of the bonds made in the product molecules.

Wait, but wait. For enthalpy of formation, we're forming 1 mole of the compound from its elements. So the reactants are the elements in their standard states. So for this molecule, which is CxHy, the reactants would be x moles of carbon (graphite) and (y/2) moles of H2 gas.

So, to compute ΔHf°, we calculate the energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants (C and H2) and subtract the energy released when the bonds in the product (the molecule) are formed.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate the total bond energy of the reactants (elements: C and H2).
2. Subtract the total bond energy of the product (the molecule's bonds).
3. The result is the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but wait. How does the enthalpy of atomization factor into this? Oh, right! The atomization enthalpy is the energy required to break all bonds in an element to make gaseous atoms. So for C, that's 1000 kJ/mol. For H2, each H-H bond is 100 kJ/mol, so each mole of H2 requires 100 kJ to break into 2 moles of H atoms. So the bond energy for H2 is 100 kJ/mol.

So the process is:

a. Compute the total energy needed to atomize all the C and H in the molecule into gaseous atoms. That's (moles of C × 1000 kJ/mol) + (moles of H × (100/2) kJ/mol). Wait, why (100/2)? Because each H2 molecule has one H-H bond. So for each mole of H2, you need 100 kJ to break into 2 moles of H atoms. So per mole of H atoms, it's 50 kJ. So for y H atoms, it's (y/2) × 100 kJ, since each H2 contributes 2 H atoms.

Wait, maybe another approach. The total energy to atomize the molecule is:

Energy = (moles of C × 1000) + (moles of H × (100 × 1/2)).

Because each C atom needs 1000 kJ to atomize (given), and each H atom requires 50 kJ (since each H-H bond is 100 kJ, and each H atom comes from breaking an H2).

But wait, the molecule's formula is needed. Let me write down the formula of the given molecule.

The given molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the carbons and hydrogens.

Let's count the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C is a group: that's 3 carbons (the central C and two CH3 groups) but wait, no. Each (CH3)2C is a propyl group? Wait, no, (CH3)2C is a substituent. Let me count:

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH: that's 4 carbons (two CH3, one C, and one CH).
- Then CH2: adds one C.
- Then CH(CH3): adds one C and three H (but counting Hs later).
- Then CH2: another C.
- Then CH=C(CH3)2: that's 3 carbons (the central CH, the C in the double bond, and two CH3 groups on that C).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each part:

Each (CH3)2C is a group attached via a double bond. Wait, maybe the molecule has the formula C12H18.

Wait, let's count each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH:
   - (CH3)2C is a group where the central C is connected to two CH3 and a double bond. So that's 3 C atoms (the central C and two CH3 groups), but wait, the (CH3)2C would be a group like CH2CH2C? No, wait, (CH3)2C- is a propyl group with a double bond. Maybe I should write the whole structure as a chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the formula.

Each (CH3)2C= is a substituent. Let's count each part:

- The first (CH3)2C=CH-: that's 4 carbons (two from CH3 groups, one from C, and one from CH-).
- Then -CH2-: that's 1 C.
- Then -CH(CH3)-: that's 1 C (with a CH3 group attached).
- Then -CH2-: another C.
- Then -CH=C(CH3)2: this part has 3 C (the CH, the C in the double bond, and two from the (CH3)2 group).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me count each C and H.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's list each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: that's 4 C (the C in the center connected to two CH3 and a CH group via a double bond).
2. -CH2-: 1 C.
3. -CH(CH3): 1 C.
4. -CH2-: 1 C.
5. -CH=C(CH3)2: the C in the double bond has two CH3 groups, so that's 3 C (the CH, the C in the double bond, and the two in (CH3)2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to list all the carbons:

- Each (CH3)2C group contributes 3 C (two CH3 and one central C).
- The CH=CH part contributes 2 C.
- The CH2 groups contribute 1 C each.
- The CH(CH3) contributes 1 C.

Wait, maybe I should actually draw this structure. Alternatively, maybe I should count each part.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the total number of carbons:

Each (CH3)2C group is 3 C, and there are two such groups (each at the ends). Then, the middle parts: CH, CH2, CH, etc.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me approach the problem differently.

The molecule has a certain number of C and H atoms. Let's calculate the number.

Each (CH3)2 group is connected via a C. So for each (CH3)2C group, that's 3 C (the central C plus two from each CH3). Since there are two such groups (one at each end), that contributes 2 × 3 = 6 C? No, wait, each (CH3)2C is a group, but perhaps each is a substituent on the main chain. Wait, perhaps the molecule is a 6-carbon chain with substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has 12 carbons. Let me think: each (CH3)2 is two CH3 groups attached to a central C, so that's 3 C per group. Since there are two such groups (one at each end), that's 3 × 2 = 6 C. Then, the rest of the molecule: looking at the middle, it's CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH-.

Wait, each CH is 1 C, each CH2 is 1 C, each CH(CH3) is 1 C. So let's count:

- The initial (CH3)2C=CH: 3 (from (CH3)2C) + 1 (CH) = 4 C.
- Then CH2: 1 C → 5.
- Then CH(CH3): 1 C → 6.
- Then CH2: 1 C →7.
- Then CH=C(CH3)2: 1 (CH) + 1 (C in double bond) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 4 C? Wait, no. The (CH3)2C part is 3 C, but in the structure, CH=C(CH3)2 would be a single C connected to another C via a double bond, and that C has two CH3 groups. So, the central C is part of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should instead focus on the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is C12H18. Let's see:

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2×3=6 H (but no, each CH3 contributes 3 H, but they're attached to a C). Let me think differently.

Wait, let me consider each substituent:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: (CH3)2C=CH- would have:

- (CH3)2C: each CH3 has 3 H, so 2×3 =6 H, plus the C which is connected to them. So the (CH3)2C group has 6 H.
- The =CH- part has 2 H (since CH is connected via double bond).

Similarly, the other end: -CH=C(CH3)2.

- The CH part has 1 H.
- The C(CH3)2 part has 2×3=6 H.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think of the whole molecule. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the general formula.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's count the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C is 3 C (1 central C plus 2 from each CH3 group). There are two such groups, so 3 × 2 =6 C.

Then the chain in the middle:

- CH (1 C)
- CH2 (1 C)
- CH(CH3) (1 C)
- CH2 (1 C)
- CH (1 C)
- C (1 C) (from the double bond in the last group)

Wait, that adds up to 6 (from the two (CH3)2C groups) + 5 (from the middle parts) = 11 C. Did I miss one? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- → 4 C (the (CH3)2C is 3 C, and the CH is 1 → total 4)
2. CH2 → 1 C → 5
3. CH(CH3) → 1 →6
4. CH2 → 1 →7
5. CH=C(CH3)2 → 3 C (the CH, the C in double bond, and the two CH3 groups attached to that C → but wait, that's 4 C: the CH (1), the C (1), and two from each CH3, but wait, no—each CH3 is a group attached, so the C in the middle is 1, plus the two CH3 groups (each has 1 C) → 3 C. So adding 3 → 7 +3=10? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too stuck. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's formula is C12H18, as I thought earlier. Let me check:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group is (CH3)2C=CH which is 4 C and 8 H (each CH3 has 3 H, two of them → 6 H, plus the CH which has 2 H → total 8 H). Then the rest of the molecule.

But perhaps this is taking too long. Let me instead proceed with the assumption that the molecule has a certain number of C and H atoms, which I can count.

Once I have the number of C and H atoms, I can calculate the total bond energies.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of C atoms:

Each (CH3)2C group is 3 C (C connected to two CH3 groups). There are two such groups at each end.

The middle part: CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

Breaking it down:

- CH: 1 C
- CH2: 1 C
- CH(CH3): 1 C (the main chain)
- CH2: 1 C
- CH=C: 2 C (the CH and the C in the double bond)

Wait, but the last part is CH=C(CH3)2, which has the central C in the double bond, connected to two CH3 groups. So that's 3 C (the CH, the central C, and each CH3 is 1 C, but wait, no: each CH3 is a substituent on the central C. So the central C has two CH3 groups attached, each contributing 1 C → so that's 1 (central) + 2 (from CH3) = 3 C. But wait, maybe I'm double-counting. Let me think: the central C is one, and each CH3 is a group attached to it, so two more C's? No, no, because each CH3 is attached to the central C as a substituent, but each CH3 itself doesn't add a new C beyond the one they're attached to. Wait, no. Each CH3 group is a methyl group attached to the central C. So the central C is bonded to three CH3 groups? No,
