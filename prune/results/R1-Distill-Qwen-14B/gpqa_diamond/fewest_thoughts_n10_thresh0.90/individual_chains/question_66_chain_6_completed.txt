Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what's SMEFT again? Oh right, it's an effective field theory framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the fields they involve.

Now, symmetries in physics are crucial because they dictate the form of the possible interactions. Effective theories must respect the underlying symmetries of the original theory they're effective for. The Standard Model, which SMEFT extends, respects certain symmetries, so SMEFT should too.

So, the options are 1-4, and the choices are various combinations. Let's break them down.

Lorentz Symmetry (1): I remember that the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant. Effective theories must respect this because they're low-energy approximations. Operators in SMEFT should thus be Lorentz scalars. So 1 must be correct.

Poincare Symmetry (2): Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Wait, but in the SMEFT, the operators are written in terms of the Standard Model fields. Do they have to respect Poincare? Well, the SM does, so SMEFT as an effective theory should as well. But wait, when you add higher-dimensional operators, does the Poincare symmetry impose anything more? Or maybe Poincare is already a subset of Lorentz symmetry in some sense, but no, Poincare includes translations too. So I think operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, but I'm not 100% certain. Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are constructed from SM fields, so they should transform correctly under Poincare. So 2 is correct.

CP symmetry (3): The SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry necessarily. Wait, the SM is CP symmetric except for certain terms which can lead to CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. But SMEFT operators should respect the same symmetries as the SM, unless they're beyond that. Wait, no, SMEFT operators can have terms that violate CP. Because if the SM itself allows CP violation, the effective theory can include that. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must. So option 3 is incorrect.

CPT symmetry (4): The SM respects CPT symmetry. I think all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT. Because CPT is a combination of charge, parity, and time reversal, and in quantum field theories with Lorentz symmetry, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators obey? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options: option C is 1,2,4 (options C says 1,2,4: options are A) 1,2; B)3,4; C)1,2,4; D)1,3,4.)

Wait, but wait, is Poincare symmetry automatically respected if Lorentz is? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translation. SMEFT is a theory in a fixed background, like Minkowski space, so translation symmetry is part of the framework. So operators would be required to be translationally invariant, but in SMEFT, the operators are written in terms of the SM fields, so their form would respect Poincare.

So the correct required symmetries are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So the answer should be option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective field theory framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, as SMEFT is a low-energy approximation of the underlying theory.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT operators must transform as Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is formulated in Minkowski space, operators must respect Poincaré symmetry as part of the framework.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model allows for CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix). SMEFT operators do not necessarily need to respect CP symmetry, as CP violation can be included in the effective theory.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and all Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry.

Thus, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination is **1, 2, 4**.

Answer: C
