Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

So, the question is about an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which makes them the standard basis states for spin-1/2 particles. So, the state is a linear combination of these two, and the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). But wait, the question says it's "proportional to", so I think I need to normalize this state first. Because probabilities depend on the square of the coefficients, so normalization is essential.

Let me write down the state. Let's say |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2-i). The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. So, calculate |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Calculating |a|^2: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. So, |a|^2 is 2.

For |b|^2: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i² = 4 - (-1) = 5. So, |b|^2 is 5.

So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, no. Because the original statement says it's proportional, so we have to normalize. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, for a 2x2 matrix, since the basis is two-dimensional, the operator matrix would be:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Because for i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So diagonal elements are zero.

Hmm, this looks familiar. Wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply by ħ/2, we get A_ij as given.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the spin operator in the x-direction. Because the spin matrices are usually Sx = ħ/2 [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, yes, the operator in question is the spin-x operator.

Wait, but the eigenstates of Sx are superpositions of |up> and |down>, right? Because Sx has eigenstates that are |+x> and |-x> states, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, I think. Because the eigenvalues of Sx are ± ħ/2.

So the question is asking for the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator when the system is in state |alpha>. So, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, since the operator is given, perhaps we can compute the probabilities by finding the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of the operator.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the expectation value of the operator. Wait, the question says "calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator" and also find the average value of the operator.

So, the operator has eigenvalues E_+ = ħ/2 and E_- = -ħ/2, with corresponding eigenstates |+x> and |-x>. The probabilities would be the square of the amplitudes of each eigenstate in the |alpha> state.

So, to find the probability of measuring E_+, we calculate |< +x | alpha > |², and similarly for E_-.

Let me write down the eigenstates of A. Since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the probability P_+ is |< +x | alpha > |², and P_- is |< -x | alpha > |².

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

First, let's write |alpha> as (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, < +x | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So that's (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ]

But <up|up> = 1, <down|down> =1, and <up|down> = 0, <down|up> =0. So this simplifies to:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 0 + 0 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me correct that. The structure is:

[ <up| + <down| ] applied to [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Which is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down>

But since <up|down>=0 and <down|up>=0, only the first and last terms remain.

So,

= (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1

= [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator:

(1 + 2) + (i -i) = 3 +0i =3

So,

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) * (3/(sqrt(7))) ) = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) = 3/sqrt(14)

So the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14). The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (9)/(14) ≈ 0.642857, which is about 0.643.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857. Looking at the options, option A has 0.64, which is close. But let me check other options. Option D has 0.61, which is close to 0.612... Hmm, wait let's compute correctly.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the calculation. Did I make a mistake in the coefficient?

Wait, < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

Wait, no. Wait, when I expanded the inner product, the terms are:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) * < up | up > + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * < down | up > + (1+i)/sqrt(7) * < up | down > + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * < down | down > 

Which simplifies to (1+i)/(sqrt(7)) *1 + (2 - i)/(sqrt(7)) * 0 + (1+i)/(sqrt(7)) *0 + (2 -i)/(sqrt(7)) *1.

So, that's (1+i + 2 -i )/(sqrt(7)) → (3)/(sqrt(7)).

Then, multiply by 1/sqrt(2):

3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) = 3/sqrt(14) ≈ 3/(3.7417) ≈ 0.80187.

Wait, no, wait that can't be right because 3/sqrt(14) is approximately 0.80187, but that would be the amplitude. So the probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14 ≈0.642857, which is about 0.643.

Wait, but wait, when I multiply (1/sqrt(2)) * (3/sqrt(7)), that's 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/sqrt(14) ≈0.80187. So the amplitude is about 0.80187, but the probability is (0.80187)^2 = 0.643.

So, the probability of measuring the +x eigenstate is approximately 0.643, and the other eigenstate would have probability 1 - 0.643 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but let me compute P_+ = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈0.642857 and P_- = (5/14)≈0.35714. So the probabilities are roughly 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. So this matches with option A.

But wait, let me check the other part: the average value of the operator.

The average value ⟨A⟩ is the expectation value of A in state |alpha>.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, its expectation value is given by ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Alternatively, since A is the spin-x operator multiplied by ħ/2, but let's compute it directly.

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So when written in the |up>, |down> basis, the matrix is:

0   ħ/2

ħ/2   0

So, the expectation value is:

⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Which is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by A, multiplied by the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, let me compute it carefully.

A is a 2x2 matrix as above. So, to compute ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩, we can write it as:

( [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] ) * A * ( [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute A multiplied by the state vector.

A * |alpha> = [ (0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)*(2 - i) ) / sqrt(7) , ( (ħ/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2 - i) ) / sqrt(7) ] ?

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. Let me write the state |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ a, b ]^T, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

Then, A |alpha> = [ (0 * a) + (ħ/2) * b , (ħ/2) * a + (0 * b) ].

So,

First component: (ħ/2) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) → (ħ/2) (2 -i) / sqrt(7)

Second component: (ħ/2) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7) → (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7)

Then, ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩ is the conjugate of [a, b] multiplied by this result.

So,

= [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

So, the product is:

(1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2) (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7)

Let me compute each term.

First term:

(1 - i)(2 - i) * ħ/(2 * 7)

Multiply (1 -i)(2 -i):

= 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i*i

= 2 -i -2i + i²

= 2 -3i + (-1) → 1 -3i.

So, first term: (1 -3i) * ħ/(14)

Second term:

(2 + i)(1 + i) * ħ/(2 *7)

Multiply (2+i)(1+i):

= 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i

= 2 +2i +i +i²

= 2 +3i -1 → 1 +3i.

So, second term: (1 +3i) * ħ/(14)

Adding both terms:

(1 -3i +1 +3i) * ħ/(14) = (2) * ħ/(14) = ħ/7.

So, the expectation value is ħ/7.

Thus, the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7. So that's option A.

But wait, another option is option D: 0.61, 0.29, and 2ħ/sqrt(7). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in probabilities.

Wait, let me re-examine the calculation of the probabilities. Another approach is to compute the inner products with |+x> and |-x>.

So, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Compute < +x | alpha >:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(1) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, because <up|up> =1, <down|down>=1, and cross terms are zero.

So, the numerator is (1+i) + (2 -i) ) =3.

Thus, < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )=3/sqrt(14). So the probability is 9/14 ≈0.642857, which is 0.643.

Similarly, < -x | alpha > is [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1
