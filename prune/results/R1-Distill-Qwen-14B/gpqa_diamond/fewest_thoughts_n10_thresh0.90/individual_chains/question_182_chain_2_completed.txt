Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity under certain conditions. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current in semiconductors when the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime is active. Let me think about what that implies.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V²)/(L³). So the current J is proportional to V squared. Wait, in the space-charge-limited region, I think the current is dominated by the electric field created by the charge carriers themselves, leading to a quadratic dependence on voltage. That makes sense because when the built-in voltage can't handle the applied voltage, the space charge builds up, changing the effective electric field.

Now, the question is about the conditions under which this equation holds. The options are talking about different device types and whether contacts are Ohmic or Schottky, whether traps are present, and which currents (drift or diffusion) are negligible.

So, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under some specific assumptions. It's for a single-carrier device, right? Because if you have both electrons and holes contributing, the equation might look different. So I can eliminate any options that mention two-carrier devices. Looking at the options, option D is about a two-carrier device. So D is probably not correct.

Next, the equation assumes negligible diffusion current. Oh wait, in the SCLC region, the dominant current is due to drift, not diffusion. So diffusion current is considered negligible. So any option that says 'negligible diffusion' would be correct in this context. Let me check each option.

Option A: says trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current. Wait, the equation is for SCLC, which is when the space charge is significant. If there are traps, that could complicate the model. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes a trap-free condition because traps would allow for more current, changing the behavior. So if the option says trap-free, that's good. But the part about 'negligible drift current'—wait, wait, no. Because in the SCLC regime, drift is the main current. So if drift is negligible, that would imply the current isn't dominated by that, which contradicts. So option A is incorrect because it says negligible drift current.

Option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier, negligible diffusion. No injection barrier—like Ohmic contact? Because a Schottky barrier would lead to a barrier for carriers. Wait, the equation assumes Ohmic contacts because otherwise, you have injection barriers which would complicate the current. So if there's no injection barrier, that's Ohmic. But the statement says 'no carrier injection barrier' which is like Ohmic. Also, if diffusion current is negligible, which is correct because SCLC is drift dominated. So B could be correct.

Option C: single-carrier with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion. Wait, Schottky contact has a barrier, so the current would be injection limited, not space-charge limited. Because in Schottky barriers, the current is limited by the barrier height, so you wouldn't reach the SCLC regime. So the Mott-Gurney equation wouldn't apply here. So option C is incorrect.

Option D is about two-carrier devices, which I already eliminated.

So between options B and maybe another.

Wait, the equation is for a single-carrier device. So any option about single-carrier is okay. In option B, it's a single-carrier device, no injection barrier (so Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current. That seems right.

Option A had 'negligible drift current' which is wrong because in SCLC, drift is the main current.

So the correct statement would be option B: trap-free single-carrier, no injection barrier (so Ohmic), and negligible diffusion.

Wait, but wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is for when the space charge is significant, so trap-free is necessary because traps would allow for more carriers, affecting the space charge. So trap-free makes sense.

Another point: the presence of a barrier (like in Schottky contacts) would mean that the current is injection limited, not space charge limited. So for SCLC, the contacts are Ohmic, so that the current isn't limited by the contacts but by the space charge.

So putting it all together:

Option B says trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (so Ohmic), and negligible diffusion current. That seems to fit the conditions needed for the Mott-Gurney equation to be valid.


The Mott-Gurney equation, which describes the dark current ($J$) versus voltage ($V$) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime, is valid under specific conditions. The equation assumes a single-carrier device, as the presence of both electrons and holes (a two-carrier device) would alter the current behavior. Additionally, the equation is derived for the SCLC regime, where drift current dominates, and diffusion current is negligible. 

The validity of the equation also requires the absence of traps, as traps would allow additional carriers to contribute to the current, complicating the space-charge-limited behavior. Furthermore, the device should have Ohmic contacts, as Schottky contacts introduce injection barriers that limit the current and prevent the SCLC regime from being reached. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because it states "negligible drift current," which contradicts the SCLC regime, where drift is the dominant current mechanism.
- **Option B** is correct because it specifies a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current, aligning with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation.
- **Option C** is incorrect because it mentions a Schottky contact, which introduces an injection barrier and prevents the SCLC regime.
- **Option D** is incorrect because it refers to a two-carrier device, which is not applicable to the Mott-Gurney equation.

Thus, the correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is provided by **Option B**.

Answer: B
