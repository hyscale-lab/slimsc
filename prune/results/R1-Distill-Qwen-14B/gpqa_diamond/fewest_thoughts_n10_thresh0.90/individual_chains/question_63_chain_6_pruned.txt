Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can have various energy states due to rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state for a given vibrational level. But wait, if the molecule is transitioning to the next state, I think that might involve both vibrational and rotational changes.

Wait, the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, right, the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, I'm not sure if it's about vibration, rotation, or both. Let me think.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). To find the next state with the lowest energy, we probably need to consider the next higher energy state, which would be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, the problem is about a photon being absorbed. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either change its vibrational state or rotational state, depending on the photon's energy.

The molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state probably refers to the ground vibrational state, with the lowest rotational state (maybe J=0, but wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational ground state is J=0 for rigid rotors, but the non-rigid rotor model allows for some changes in bond length, so maybe that's a different consideration).

But wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model is actually a combination model where both rotation and vibration are considered. So the total energy has contributions from both. To find the photon's energy, we should consider the energy difference between the current state and the next possible state.

So the molecule is in the ground state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0? or J=1?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are quantized, and each vibrational level has rotational sublevels. The energy levels are given by E_v,J = (something) * v + (something else) * J(J+1). So the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, I think.

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either increase its vibrational state (v goes from 0 to 1) or increase its rotational state (J increases by 1, but wait, J can only change by ±1 in a photon-induced transition, but since it's the ground state, J=0, so J can only go up to 1).

Wait, but what is the next lowest energy state? The next state would be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). Which one has lower energy?

To determine which transition requires a lower-energy photon, I need to calculate the energy difference for both possible transitions and see which is smaller.

Wait, let me think about the energies. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (1/2) h w_v + h w_v v, where w_v is the vibrational angular frequency. Wait, no, the standard expression is E_v = (v + 1/2) h w_v. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w_v.

For rotational energy, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_1 - E_0 = B [1(2) - 0] = 2B.

So which of these is smaller: h w_v or 2B? If h w_v is smaller than 2B, then the vibrational transition would require a lower-energy photon, which is more likely to be the next state.

But wait, the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, in the rigid rotor model, B is constant, but in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length is not fixed, so B isn't a constant. But for the purpose of this problem, probably we can treat it as a rigid rotor since we're given a bond length R and asked to compute.

Wait, perhaps I should compute both possible transitions and see which one has the lower energy. Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would correspond to the transition that requires the least energy, i.e., the photon with the least energy (longest wavelength) would cause a transition.

Wait no, the question is phrased a bit confusingly: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm, perhaps it's the next state, regardless of its energy being higher or lower. So maybe it's the transition to the first possible higher energy state, which could be either vibrational or rotational.

But I think the question is more likely asking for the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state. So I need to figure out what the next state is after the fundamental state.

Wait, the fundamental state would be the lowest possible energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state, which is the next higher energy state. But the first excited state could be either the next vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or the next rotational state (v=0, J=1). Which of these two has a lower energy?

So I need to compute the energies for both possible transitions and see which one is lower. The photon's energy must match the lower of the two to cause the transition.

So, let's compute the energy differences.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference: delta E_vib = E_v=1 - E_v=0 = h w_v (since E_v = (v + 1/2) h w_v, so the difference between v=1 and v=0 is h w_v).

Second, compute the rotational energy difference: delta E_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = B [1*(1+1) - 0] = 2B.

But I need the value of B, the rotational constant. B is given by (h/(8 pi² I c)) where I is the moment of inertia. Wait, no, the rotational constant B is (h/(8 pi² I)) in energy units, but sometimes it's expressed in cm^-1 as B = h c / (8 pi² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, I might have that mixed up. Let me think: The rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which is given by B = (h²)/(8 pi² I c). Wait, no, maybe I should get the formula right.

The rotational constant B has units of cm^-1. The formula for B is (h)/(8 pi² I c), where I is the moment of inertia in g cm². Wait, no, I think it's (h c)/(8 pi² I), because B is expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1). Hmm.

Wait, let me recall. The rotational energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) h c B)/2, but maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Alternatively, the moment of inertia I is given by I = mu R², where mu is the reduced mass and R is the bond length.

So, the first step is to compute the reduced mass mu.

The problem gives Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass mu is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but to compute I, I need to convert amu into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So mu = (20 * 2) / (22) amu = (40/22) amu = 20/11 amu.

Wait, 20/11 is approximately 1.818, correct. So mu = (20 * 2) / (22) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that. 20 * 2 =40, divided by 22 is 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

So mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Compute mu = (40)/(22) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

40 divided by 22 is approximately 1.81818.

So mu ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈?

1.8 * 1.66 = approx 2.988, but more accurately:

1.81818 * 1.6605 = Let's compute it step by step.

1.81818 * 1 = 1.81818

1.81818 * 0.6 = 1.09090

1.81818 * 0.06 = 0.10909

1.81818 * 0.0005 = ~0.000909

Adding them together: 1.81818 +1.09090=2.90908, plus 0.10909=3.01817, plus 0.000909≈3.01908.

So approximately 3.019e-27 kg.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 is approximately 3.019e-27 kg.

So mu ≈ 3.019e-27 kg.

Then I = mu R². R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2 * 1e-10 meters = 2e-10 m.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = mu * R² = 3.019e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Wait, let me make sure. 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 12.076e-47 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by B = h/(8 pi² I), but I think I might have gotten the formula wrong earlier. Let me recall: the rotational energy levels are E_J = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1). So the term (h²/(8 pi² I)) is B, the rotational constant, but sometimes B is expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), so perhaps the formula is B = h/(8 pi² I c), where c is the speed of light.

Wait, let's clarify. The rotational energy levels are E_J = (h c B) J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1. Alternatively, some sources write B as h/(8 pi² I c), so that E_J is in terms of cm^-1.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the energy difference and then find the photon's momentum from that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy difference delta E_rot = 2B, since E_J=1 is 2B (because E_J=0 is 0, E_J=1 is 2B).

Wait, no. E_J = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_J=1 - E_J=0 = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * (2 - 0) = 2 h²/(8 pi² I) = h²/(4 pi² I).

Wait, yes, that's correct.

So delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I).

Similarly, the vibrational energy difference is delta E_vib = h w.

We need to compute both delta E_rot and delta E_vib and see which is smaller because the photon will cause the transition with the lower energy.

Wait, but I also have to consider whether the molecule is in the ground state of both vibrational and rotational energy. The fundamental state is typically the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next possible states are either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

So the energy differences are delta E_vib = h w and delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I).

We need to compute both and see which is smaller.

So let's compute delta E_vib first.

Given w = 4e14 rad/s.

So delta E_vib = h * w.

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

So delta E_vib = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, delta E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I).

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

I is 1.2076e-46 kg m².

So, denominator is 4 pi² I = 4 * (9.8696) * 1.2076e-46.

4 * 9.8696 ≈ 39.478.

39.478 * 1.2076e-46 ≈ 39.478 *1.2076 ≈47.67, so 47.67e-46 = 4.767e-45.

So delta E_rot = (4.39e-67) / (4.767e-45) ) = (4.39 /4.767 ) *1e-22 ≈ 0.921e-22 =9.21e-23 J.

So delta E_rot is approximately 9.21e-23 J.

Comparing delta E_vib (2.65e-19 J) and delta E_rot (9.21e-23 J), the rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the photon needed would have energy corresponding to delta E_rot.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state. So if the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, the next state with the lowest possible energy would be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). Since delta E_rot is smaller than delta E_vib, the photon's energy would correspond to delta E_rot, so the molecule would transition to J=1, v=0.

But wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, do transitions involve both vibrational and rotational changes? Or can a photon cause a transition that only changes the rotational state? I think that in the rigid rotor-vibration model, transitions can involve both types of changes, but if the photon's energy is sufficient for either, it can cause either. However, the problem is asking for the photon that would switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the lower energy transition.

So the delta E_rot is lower, so that's the transition we need to consider.

Now, the photon's energy is delta E_rot = h w_rot, but wait, the energy of the photon is equal to the energy difference between the states. So E_photon = delta E_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

But the question is asking for the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because photons have energy E = p c, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light.

So p = E / c.

But wait, let me think again. The energy of a photon is E = h f = p c, where f is frequency and p is momentum. So p = E / c.

So, given that E_photon = 9.21e-23 J, then p = E_photon / c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns.

Wait, because 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s, so the units are correct.

But 3e-31
