Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms, like X and Y here. The question is about what happens when a photon is absorbed, causing the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, right? So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics of how the energy levels work in the rotation-vibration model.

I think the energy levels for a diatomic molecule involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. Oh right, the rotational part is similar to a rigid rotor, and the vibrational part is like a quantum harmonic oscillator. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe the bond length isn't fixed. Oh, but for the fundamental state, the rotational and vibrational parts are both in their ground states.

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. But what's the next state? Well, the lowest energy transition is usually the one where either the vibrational or rotational state increases by the smallest amount. Since the problem states it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think the photon must cause a change in the vibrational state because the vibrational energy levels are spaced further apart than rotational ones. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the energy spacing between vibrational levels is larger than that of rotational levels. So a change in vibrational state would require a higher energy photon than a rotational change. But the question is about the next state, so maybe the molecule transitions to the next vibrational state, or the next rotational state.

Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm, perhaps that refers to the next higher energy state in total, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

But in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and the transitions are determined by the selection rules. For diatomic molecules, the vibrational selection rule is Δv = ±1, and for rotational ΔJ = ±1. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next states could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy?

Wait
