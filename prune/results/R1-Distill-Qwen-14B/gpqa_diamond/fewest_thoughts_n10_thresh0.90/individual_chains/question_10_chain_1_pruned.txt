Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the options a to d has the highest density. The options are about different masses and densities, so I need to figure out each planet's density and compare them.

First, I'll recall that density is mass divided by volume. The formula is density = mass/volume. Oh wait, but for planets, especially when comparing to Earth, the density might relate to their composition. I think Earth-like planets have a certain density based on their composition.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, Earth's mass is about 5.97 x 10^24 kg, and its radius is around 6,371 km. The density of Earth is known to be about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this planet would have the same density as Earth. So a's density is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait. The question says that this planet has a density of 5.5. So is that the same as Earth? If it's 2 Earth masses but same density, then the volume must be larger, because density is mass/volume. So if mass doubles but density stays the same, volume must also double. But that's not necessary for answering this question because the density is given already as 5.5. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Hmm. Same composition as Earth implies same density as Earth. Because composition affects the density. So if Earth's density is about 5.5, then this planet's density is also 5.5. But wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, same composition would mean same density, yes. Because density is an intensive property, so regardless of mass, if the composition is same, density is same. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Option d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. Again, same composition, so same density as Earth, which is 5.5. So, same as a, c, d, and b.

Wait,
