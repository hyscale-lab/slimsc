Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

So, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star. Both methods, transit and radial velocity, detected them. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are A to D.

I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says they have the same albedo, so that cancels out.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is albedo. Since A is the same for both, it will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio will depend on sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) divided by sqrt(R_star/(2a2)).

Wait wait, no, because the ratio is T1/T2. Let me think. The formula is T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_*/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). So for each planet, T1 and T2, the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R_*/(2a1)) / (R_*/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). Because R* and 2 are in both numerator and denominator, they cancel. So it's sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, no, wait. Let me write that properly. The formula is T_p = T_* * sqrt(R_*/(2a)). So, T1 = T_* * sqrt(R_*/(2a1)), T2 = T_* * sqrt(R_*/(2a2)). So T1 / T2 = sqrt( (R_*/(2a1)) ) / sqrt( R_*/(2a2) ) ). The T_* and R_* and 2 cancel out, so it's sqrt(a2/a1). Because sqrt(R/(2a1)) / sqrt(R/(2a2)) = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) * (2a2/R) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. When you take the ratio T1/T2, it's [T_* * sqrt(R_*/(2a1))] / [T_* * sqrt(R_*/(2a2))]. The T_* and R_* and 2 all cancel, so it's sqrt( (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So yes, the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1). So if a1 is larger than a2, then T1 would be smaller than T2. Because as a increases, the distance from the star increases, so the temperature decreases.

But how do I find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets? The question mentions the radial velocity method shifts in the forbidden line. Oh, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and its distance from the star.

Wait, the question gives the RV shifts. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Similarly, Planet2 causes a 0.04 Å shift.

I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p^3 sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (c * (1 + M_p/M_* ) ) )

Wait, maybe there's a simpler version. I recall that for circular orbits (e=0), and when M_p << M_*, which is usually the case, the RV semi-amplitude simplifies.

The formula I remember is K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c T) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) ), but maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula that relates the Doppler shift (K) to the planet's mass and orbital period. But without knowing the period, maybe I can relate the velocities to the masses and the distances.

Wait, another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since e is zero, and M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But without knowing the period, perhaps it's tricky. Alternatively, since both planets are orbiting the same star, maybe the ratio of their K values can be used to find the ratio of their (M_p / a^(1/2)) )?

Wait, another approach: Since both planets are detected via RV method, their K values are given. The K value is the semiamplitude of the star's velocity. The RV method gives K = (v) proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(1/3} a^(1/2}) ) ), but I'm not exactly confident about this.

Wait, perhaps using the formula:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

But this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the relation that for a given star, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (a^(1/2} (M_* + M_p)^(1/2} ) ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. I think the formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3} ) * ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( ( (2 pi )^(1/3) ) * (P)^(-1/3) ) )

But perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me try to think of another way.

Alternatively, the RV velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (v_0) = ( (2 pi G ) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But without knowing the period, maybe I can't proceed this way.

Wait, another approach: The transit method gives the planet's radius, which relates to the size of the transit relative to the star. But for RV, it's about the Doppler shift. But perhaps the key is to find the ratio of the planets' distances (a1 and a2) from the star, because equilibrium temperature only depends on a.

So if I can find the ratio a1/a2, then I can find the ratio T1/T2 as sqrt(a2/a1) as earlier.

But how to find a1 and a2?

Well, from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3} ) ) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( ( (2 pi)^(1/3) ) * (a (1 - e²) )^(1/2} ) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me look up the correct formula for K.

Wait, I think the correct formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * P ) / (2 π (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) * ( 1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recall that K is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The more massive the planet and the closer it is (smaller a), the larger K would be.

But given that both planets are causing RV shifts, their K values are given as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. Wait, but the units are in Ångströms. I think RV semi-amplitude is measured in m/s. Oh, right, 1 Å is 0.1 nm, but how does that translate into velocity?

Wait, the Doppler shift in wavelength is related to velocity via the formula:

Δλ / λ = v/c

So, the shift in wavelength (Δλ) is given as 0.03 Å for planet 1, and 0.04 Å for planet 2. The line is at 6300 Å. So the ratio v/c would be Δλ / λ.

So, for planet1: v1 = c * (Δλ1 / λ) = c * (0.03 / 6300) )

Similarly, v2 = c * (0.04 / 6300 )

So, v1 = c * 0.03 / 6300, v2 = c * 0.04 / 6300.

Hmm, but I'm not sure whether to use the same λ for both. Since both shifts are in the same line, I think that's correct.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to v.

So, K1 = v1, K2 = v2.

So, K1/K2 = (0.03 / 6300) / (0.04 / 6300) ) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

So, K1/K2 = 3/4.

But K is also related to the planetary and orbital parameters. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3} ) ) )^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( ( (2 pi)^(1/3) ) * (a (1 - e²) )^(1/2} ) )

But perhaps it's easier to use the approximation that when M_p << M_*, and e≈0, the formula simplifies. Let me think.

The simplified version when M_p << M_*, and e=0:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3} ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( ( (2 pi)^(1/3) ) * (a )^(1/2} ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write K in terms of a, M_p, and M_*. Let's see.

K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2 π G ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )

But without knowing P, the orbital period, this might not help.

Wait, another approach: using Kepler's third law, which relates a and P.

Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) ) = (G (M_* + M_p) ) / (4 π^2 )

But M_p is much smaller than M_*, so approximately:

a^3 / P^2 = G M_* / (4 π^2 )

So, P^2 = (4 π^2 a^3 ) / ( G M_* )

But I'm not sure if that helps. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps if I can express a in terms of K. Let's see.

Alternative formula for K (simplified for circular orbit and M_p << M_* ):

K = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) a^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

But e is zero, so:

K = (G M_p sin i )^(1/3) / ( M_*^(2/3) a^(1/6) ) ) * (1 / (2 pi )^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to consider the relationship between K and a.

Wait, let's consider that K is proportional to (M_p) / (a^(1/2}) )

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of a1 and a2 using the ratio of K, M_p, and the fact that the star is the same for both.

Let me think. Let's say for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p sin i ) / (a^(1/2} ) )

But since both planets are orbiting the same star, perhaps sin i is similar? Or is there a way to relate their K values, M_p, and a?

Wait, assuming that both planets have the same inclination i, which is often the case if they're in the same system. So, sin i is the same for both. So, K1/K2 = (M_p1 / a1^(1/2}) ) / (M_p2 / a2^(1/2}) )

So, K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * sqrt(a2/a1)

We know K1 = 0.03 Å, K2 = 0.04 Å => K1/K2 = 0.75.

M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. So M_p1/M_p2 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So, substituting:

0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Let me solve for sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 0.75 / 1.4 = 0.5357.

Wait, 0.75 / 1.4 = 75/(140) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

So sqrt( a2 /a1 ) = 0.5357 → a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

So a2 = 0.287 a1 → a1 = a2 / 0.287 ≈ 3.48 a2.

Wait, wait, no: if sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.5357, then a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 = ~0.287.

So a2 = 0.287 * a1.

So a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the substitution. Let's go back.

We have K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So, 0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So, 0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.4: 0.75 /1.4 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

0.75 /1.4 is the same as 75/140 = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

So sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈ 0.5357 → a2/a1 ≈ (0.5357)^2 = 0.287.

So a2 = 0.287 a1 → a1 = a2 / 0.287 ≈ 3.48 a2.

So a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

We have a2/a1 = 0.287.

So sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So T1 is about 0.536 times T2. So the ratio T1/T2 ≈ 0.536.

Looking at the options: option C is ~0.53, which is close.

But let me double-check the steps to make sure.

1. Calculated K1 and K2 from the wavelength shifts. Correct, since Δλ/λ = v/c, so K1=0.03/6300 * c, K2=0.04/6300 * c. So K1/K2 = 3/4.

2. Assumed that sin i is the same for both planets. Since they are in the same system, this is a reasonable assumption.

3. Used the formula K ∝ (M_p) / sqrt(a), so K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt(a2/a1). Correct, as in the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / sqrt(a).

4. Plugged in the numbers: 3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1). Solved for sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) ≈ 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

5. Squared that to get a2/a1 ≈ 0.287, which implies a1 ≈ 3.48 a2.

6. Equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536, which is approximately 0.53. So option C.

Hmm, that makes sense. So the answer should be option C, ~0.53.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_p = T_* \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} \left(1 - A\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the key is to find the ratio of their orbital distances, \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), from the star.

### Step 1: Relating Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (\(K\)) to Orbital Distance
The radial velocity semi-amplitude (\(K\)) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

For two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of their \(K\) values is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Known Values
From the problem:
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), so \(\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75\),
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_\oplus\), \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_\oplus\), so \(\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714\).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 0.75 \cdot 0.714 \approx 0.536
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the Equilibrium Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx 0.536
\]

### Step 4: Matching to the Closest Option
The closest option to \(0.536\) is **C) ~0.53**.

### Final Answer
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.

Answer: C
