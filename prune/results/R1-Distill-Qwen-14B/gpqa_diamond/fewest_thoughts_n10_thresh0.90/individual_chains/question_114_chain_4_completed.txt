Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B and H2O to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, let's start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones using a substitution reaction. Wait, but in what conditions? Oh, right, the formation of cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion in a basic solution. The mechanism involves the attack of the nucleophilic CN- on the carbonyl carbon, followed by the addition of a proton (probably from water or acid) to form the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but in the presence of a base, the reaction would proceed. Wait, no, wait: NaCN is a source of CN- but is it in a basic solution? Because NaCN is a salt of a weak acid (HCN), so it's basic. So when butan-2-one reacts with NaCN, I think it would form the cyanohydrin. But the reaction here requires another reagent A. Or wait, maybe NaCN is the reagent, and A is the acid workup?

Wait, no. Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So A is another reagent. So in the cyanohydrin formation, the ketone and CN- (from NaCN) react. But the reaction conditions usually involve a base, or maybe just a protic workup. Wait, the initial step is the nucleophilic attack, then the proton comes from somewhere. So perhaps A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B for reagent A), or maybe a different acid.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure should be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the OH is on the same carbon as the CN and the two methyl groups. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin.

So the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The steps are: ketone plus CN- gives the cyanohydrin. But the conditions for this reaction—what is usually done? I think the reaction is typically done under basic conditions because CN- is a strong nucleophile in basic conditions. Wait, or maybe it's done in a neutral or acidic solution.

Wait, another thought. The formation of the cyanohydrin usually occurs in a solution that allows the deprotonation. Or perhaps it's done using aqueous acid. Wait, no—I think the reaction is done in a basic solution because the cyanide ion is a weak base. So when you add NaCN, which is in a basic solution, to the ketone, it forms the cyanohydrin.

But in the problem, the reagent A is added. So perhaps A is an acid. Wait, that doesn't fit. Or maybe the reaction uses a base as A. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the workup. After the initial reaction, you might need to protonate the product. In the cyanohydrin formation, the O- would be present after the attack, so you need to protonate it. So perhaps A is an acid, like H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So if A is H3O+, that would make sense as the workup. So the first reaction is done in the presence of NaCN and H3O+?

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. The reaction between a ketone and NaCN to form the cyanohydrin—what conditions are needed? I think the reaction is typically done in a basic solution. So maybe the NaCN provides the CN- and the basic condition. Wait, but NaCN is a salt of HCN, which is a weak acid, so NaCN is basic. So perhaps the reaction doesn't require any additional base, but maybe just the aqueous solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction requires an acid for the protonation step. So maybe the reaction is done with NaCN and aqueous acid (H3O+). So A is H3O+.

Ok, so for the first reaction, A is H3O+ which is in options A and B.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with reagent B and water to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

Nitriles can be converted to carboxylic acids through hydrolysis. The typical conditions for this are either acidic or basic. The reaction usually involves adding water in the presence of an acid or base catalyst.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's likely that the nitrile underwent hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under strong acidic or basic conditions. For acidic conditions, you usually have a strong acid like H2SO4 and heat. For basic conditions, you might use NaOH and heat, followed by acidification to isolate the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in this case, the reagent is B, which is used along with H2O. So what is B? If it's an acid, like HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (option B and D). Alternatively, maybe it's a base, but the options don't have any bases except perhaps if B is something else.

Wait, but in the product, the OH is still present. So the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid must not affect the existing hydroxyl group. Hmm.

Wait, but the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So in the presence of water and acid, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid via hydrolysis. The conditions for this are typically either strong acid (like conc. H2SO4) and heat, or strong base and then acid workup.

Wait, in the options, the possible reagents for B are HCl, CH3COOH, HCl again, or CH3COOH.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, while CH3COOH is a weak acid. So for the hydrolysis, perhaps using HCl in water would be the right condition.

Let me think. Nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions uses H2SO4 as a catalyst, but HCl is also a strong acid. So perhaps in the presence of HCl (B is HCl), the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

But wait, the starting material also has a hydroxyl group. Would HCl in water affect that? The hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the nitrile. The structure is 2-hydroxy-2-(something)butanenitrile. So the adjacent groups are a hydroxyl and a nitrile. Now, under strong acidic conditions, would the hydroxyl get protonated? Or would that not matter?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses a weak acid. Wait, no, because the nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid usually requires strong acid conditions. So I think reagent B is HCl.

Looking back, the options for B: in option A, B is HCl; option C, B is HCl. So if I'm thinking that B is HCl, then I need to see which option has B as HCl.

Wait, let me recap.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. If A is H3O+, then options A and B are possible.

Second reaction: nitrile + B (H2O) → carboxylic acid. If B is HCl, then options A and C have B as HCl.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+; for the second, B is HCl. So in the options, which option has A = H3O+ and B= HCl? Looking at the options:

Option A: A= H3O+, B= HCl → yes.

Option C: A= NaHSO3, B= HCl → but if A isn't H3O+ here, then it's not matching.

So the correct option would be A, which is A= H3O+ and B= HCl.

Wait, but wait another thought. In the first reaction, could A be something else? Let me think again about the first reaction.

The product is the cyanohydrin, which is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone.

The conditions for this are typically in a basic solution because CN- is a weak base. So perhaps the reaction is done without any additional acid, but maybe with a base. But in the problem statement, the reagent A is added along with NaCN.

Wait, so the first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So if A is something that provides the necessary conditions for the cyanohydrin formation.

Wait, another possibility: sometimes, the formation of cyanohydrin can be done under acidic conditions. Wait, no, I think it's usually done in neutral or slightly basic conditions because the CN- is a better nucleophile there.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses a strong acid, like H3O+, to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. That way, the CN- can attack. So the presence of H3O+ would provide the necessary H+ for the protonation.

So in that case, A would be H3O+, which matches options A and B.

Wait, but what about the second reaction. If B is HCl, then the reaction is in HCl and water. But wait, in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When the nitrile is hydrolyzed, under strong acidic conditions, the -CN becomes -COOH.

But wait, could the presence of HCl and water cause any other reactions, like the oxidation of the secondary alcohol? Because HCl is a strong acid but not an oxidizing agent. Wait, no, in aqueous HCl, perhaps it's just the nitrile that's reacting.

Another thing: when nitriles are hydrolyzed under acidic conditions, they go through an intermediate imidamide stage, which then tautomerizes to the carboxylic acid. So yes, HCl would provide the acidic environment.

So putting it together, the first reagent A is H3O+ and the second reagent B is HCl. So looking at the options, option A has A= H3O+ and B= HCl. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: A=H3O+, B= HCl

Yes.

So the answer should be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires a nucleophilic attack of CN⁻ on the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, followed by protonation to form the hydroxyl group. The reagent A is likely H₃O⁺, which provides the acidic environment necessary for protonation after the nucleophilic attack. This matches the conditions for cyanohydrin formation.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong acidic conditions. Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) is the appropriate reagent B to facilitate this reaction.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the conditions for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is not suitable for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the cyanohydrin formation, as it does not provide the necessary acidic environment.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
