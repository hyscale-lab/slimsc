Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygen counts.

First, let's break down the data provided step by step. 

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around that region usually indicate O-H groups. So, something like an alcohol, phenol, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's very broad, isn't that more characteristic of a carboxylic acid? Because alcohols have broad peaks too, but I think carboxylic acids are broader. But wait, maybe it's a conjugated system or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group in a different environment.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a strong peak, which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Wait, another thought: the carbonyl in a conjugated system (like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester) might have a lower wavenumber. Also, if there's a peak around 1650, that could be a C=C stretch. Wait, but the 1700 is probably the carbonyl.

Wait, so maybe two carbonyl groups? No, that's less likely. Wait, 1700 is a strong peak for a carbonyl. 1650 could be another functional group. Let me think: if the compound has a carbonyl and maybe an aromatic ring, the 1650 could be the C=C in the ring. So perhaps it's something like an aromatic ketone or an aromatic ester.

Moving on to the 1H NMR: several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the presence of a double bond, maybe in an aromatic ring or an isolated double bond. So the compound has an alkene group.

The Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: 45 is the molecular ion for CH3OCH2CH3 (dimethyl ether?), but wait, no. Wait, 45 is also the m/z for C3H7O+ (like from an ester cleavage). Or it could be from a fragment like (CH2)2O, which is 45 (12*2 +1*4 +16=24+4+16=44? Wait, no, 12*2=24, 1*5=5 (wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused). Alternatively, but I'm not too sure. Another approach: looking for common fragments that give m/z 45. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is 91, so that's not it. Maybe the fragment is from an ester or ketone. Wait, another common fragment is from the loss of a molecule from the compound. For example, in esters, the loss of the R-O group could leave a carbonyl group as a fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage between carbonyl and another group. I'm not too sure about the mass spec part, but I'll come back to it.

Now let's look at the options for the chemical formulas:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

We need to figure out which one fits the data.

So first, the IR data. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an O-H group. So we probably have either an alcohol or an acid. But wait, the presence of a carbonyl (from 1700 cm^-1) could mean it's an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or acid. But if there's a broad O-H, then perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid, but then where would the other O come in?

Wait, another thought: if the compound has both a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group, that could explain the IR. So maybe it's a ketone with an alcohol group. But that's less common than an ester or something else.

Looking at the options, the ones with two oxygens are A and C. Let's think about those. So if the formula is C6H12O2, that's 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. Degree of unsaturation: each degree is a double bond or a ring. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So that would be one ring or one double bond. But wait, wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So a degree of unsaturation of 1 could mean either a ring plus a double bond? Or another way, let's calculate for each option.

Wait, let me compute the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Formula: C6H12Ox.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X=0 and N=0,

For each option:

A) C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So DoU=1. So either one ring, one double bond, or a combination (like a ring and a double bond, but that would be 2 DoU, which would require DoU=2.

Wait, no, DoU counts each ring or double bond as 1. So if a compound has a ring and a double bond, that's 2
