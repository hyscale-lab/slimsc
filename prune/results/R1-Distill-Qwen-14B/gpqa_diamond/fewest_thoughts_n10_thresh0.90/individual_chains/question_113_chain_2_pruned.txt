Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see what info I have.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak at around 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of O-H groups, especially since it's broad. Broad peaks in IR around that region are usually from either alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. But let's look at the other peaks. There are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower; that might correspond to conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an amide, but since we don't have amide info, perhaps it's an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching). Hmm, but 1650 is a bit high for a simple aromatic ring. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl with conjugation, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl? Or maybe it's a conjugated ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those in double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound has at least one double bond, probably in a vinyl group.

Mass spec: The fragment peak at m/z 45. Common fragments at 45 include things like (CH3)2CHO+ (which is 45: 45 is 45). Wait, 45 is the molecular weight. So what's 45? Let me think. The molecular ion at m/z 45 could be something like CH3COOH (but that's 60, wait no, wait). Wait, maybe it's something like (CH3)2CO+? Wait, no, (CH3)2CO is acetone, molecular weight is 58. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from another structure. Let's think. The molecular formula is one of the four. So let's calculate their molecular weights:

C6H12O2: (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) = 72 +12 +32 = 116 g/mol.
C6H10O: 72 +10 +16 = 98.
C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.
C6H12O: 72 +12 +16=100.

The mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So what's 45 in these? Let's see, 45 is exactly half of 90, which is the molecular weight of some compounds. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, maybe a CH3CO group breaks off, which is 45 (since CH3CO is C2H3O, molecular weight 45: 12*2 +3 +16=24+3+16=43? No, that can't be. Wait, wait, acetate is OAc-: CH3CO-, which is 59 (12*2 +3*1 +16=24+3+16=43? No, wait 12*2 is 24, 3*1 is 3, 16 is 16, so 24+3=27 +16=43? Hmm, seems off. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion (like CH2=CH-O- or something else). Alternatively, let's think about possible structures.

Looking back at the IR: a broad O-H peak (like alcohol or carboxylic acid). Let's consider that. If there's a carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹) and another peak at 1650, perhaps it's an ester. Because esters have two carbonyl peaks, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. For example, a ketone with an adjacent double bond could have a lower carbonyl peak. Wait, but the 1700 peak is strong, perhaps that's the main carbonyl, and 1650 is another functional group, like an aromatic ring or another carbonyl.

Wait, but maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Or maybe a beta-keto ester, which could have two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated ester, so the carbonyl is at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond is at 1650.

So putting this together, the structure could have an ester group (since esters typically have a carbonyl around 1700 and an O-H stretch would be from an alcohol, but wait, an ester doesn't have O-H unless it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is strong. A carboxylic acid has a very broad O-H. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, would the IR show a peak at 1700? Because carboxylic acids have a strong C=O around 1700. However, sometimes it can be a bit lower if it's conjugated. The other peak at 1650 might be from the -COOH group's O-H bending, but that's usually around 600-700 cm⁻¹. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated double bond.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the possible formulas and see which ones fit the data.

The mass spec fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about what's 45. The possible fragments for each formula:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 116. If it breaks off a 45 fragment, the remaining would be 71. What's 71? Maybe a CH2CH2O group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO (45) group. Wait, CH3CO is 43. Hmm, not 45. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2CO+ (acetone is 58, so a fragment of 45 isn't matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a smaller fragment, like a CH2CH2O group but not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight 98. If a fragment at 45 is present, the remaining would be 53. Not sure about that.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114. If a fragment is at 45, the other is 69. Hmm, 69 could be something like CH2=CH2O or similar.

Option D: C6H12O. MW 100. Fragment at 45, remainder 55. Maybe a CH3COOH isn't right because that's 60.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CO+ group. The molecular weight of CH3CO+ is 43. Hmm, but the peak is at 45. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula can be determined from the degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate that for each option.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2=1.

So one DoU. That could be a ring plus a double bond or one ring or one double bond.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = (12+2-10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2.

So two DoU: could be two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (14-10)/2 = 2.

Same as B.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU = (14-12)/2 = 1.

So options A and D have one DoU, B and C have two.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl implies at least one double bond. So the structure must have at least one double bond. So DoU must account for that.

If the compound has a double bond (DoU counts 1) and say a ring (DoU counts 1), that gives two. But if DoU is 1, then the molecule must have either one ring or one double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So DoU must be at least 1.

But the DoU for A and D is 1, which would account for one double bond or a ring. If it's a double bond, that's possible. But if it's a ring, then no double bond, but the NMR shows vinyl, so that can't be.

So if the compound has a double bond, then the DoU must be at least 1. But if the formula has DoU=1, then the only other possibility is a ring. But the presence of a double bond would require at least DoU=2. Wait, no: DoU counts each ring and each double bond as 1. So if a molecule has a ring and a double bond, that's two DoU. If it has two double bonds or one ring and one double bond, etc.

Wait, no: each ring or double bond is 1 DoU. So, if a molecule has a double bond and a ring, that's two DoU. So if the formula has DoU=1, then it can have only one double bond or one ring.

But in the NMR, we have vinyl hydrogens, which require a double bond. So the molecule must have at least one double bond, so DoU must be at least 1. So the formula could be A or D (DoU=1) or B or C (DoU=2).

Wait, but B and C have DoU=2, which could account for the double bond plus another ring or another double bond.

So, if the compound has a double bond (1 DoU), but some other feature, like a ring or another double bond (hence DoU=2), but the formula for A and D only have DoU=1. So in that case, the structure with DoU=1 and a double bond can't have any rings or other double bonds. So perhaps the formula is not A or D. Because the presence of a double bond (from the NMR) would require that DoU >=1, but if the formula has DoU=1, there's only one ring or one double bond. But since the NMR shows vinyl (double bond), then that's the one DoU. So, no rings. So the structure is a molecule with one double bond and no rings.

Wait, but the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. That suggests an O-H group. So which formulas have O?

All options have O except B and D? No, looking back, all options have O except perhaps none. Wait, no, the options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So all options have O. So the presence of O is given.

So, going back: the compound has O-H (from the IR), a carbonyl group (from IR 1700), a double bond (from NMR), and a fragment at 45.

Let me think about possible structures. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) would have a carbonyl group and an ester oxygen. But would that produce a fragment at 45? Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec. The fragment at 45 might correspond to a common ion. Let me think about what compounds have a 45 fragment.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHCOOH (but that's more than 45, no). Wait, wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2COH, but that's not a standard fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO (acetate) group. The molecular weight of CH3CO is 43, which is close but not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O fragment (formaldehyde), but that's 30. Not matching. Or maybe a CH3COO group (which is 59). No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is an acetylium ion (CH3C+=O), which would be 43. But the peak is at 45. Hmm. Not matching.

Wait, maybe the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement. McLafferty rearrangement typically occurs in ketones with an adjacent alkoxy group. The fragment in such cases could have a specific mass. For example, the loss of a specific group. I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group, but I'm not sure. Let's think about which options can produce a fragment of 45.

Looking at option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114. If the molecule loses a group with molecular weight 45, the remaining is 69. 69 is the molecular weight of methyl vinyl ketone (but I'm not sure), but perhaps it's a smaller fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is something like methyl acrylate. Let's see, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its molecular formula is C4H6O2. The molecular weight is 88, which doesn't match any of the given options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diester or something else.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecular formula. The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → DoU 1 → possible structures: one double bond or one ring.

But wait, if it's one double bond, then the molecule can't have a ring. So the structure would have a carbonyl group (from IR 1700) and a double bond (from NMR).

So perhaps it's a cyclic ketone? No, because that would require a ring and a carbonyl. The DoU would be 2, but option A has DoU=1. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple ester with an alcohol group. Wait, but esters don't have O-H unless it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diol ester or something with an O-H and an ester group.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a hemiacetal or something else. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: the presence of a carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹) and an O-H (broad) might suggest a carboxylic acid. But then the formula would need to have the right number of oxygens. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have one more O, perhaps. Wait, let's think: a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. So for a six-carbon acid, it would be C6H12O2. That's option A.

But wait, the IR shows a peak at 1650 cm⁻¹. Carboxylic acids have a strong C=O around 1700 and an O-H around 2500-3300 (very broad). Also, the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually a strong, broad peak. So that fits with the data.

But wait, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the formula would be C6H12O2, which is option A. But let's see if that fits the other data.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the molecule must have a double bond. But a carboxylic acid with a double bond would have a structure like CH2=CHCOOH or similar. Let's see, that would be C3H4O2. But our compound is C6H12O2. So perhaps the molecule is a di-substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, but that would have two COOH groups, which would require more oxygens, but option A only has two O's. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But the formula would need to fit one of the options. Let's calculate the formula for that ester: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2. That's option C.

Wait, that's an ester with a double bond. Let me see:

Ester group (O and COO), plus a double bond (vinyl group). So in the FTIR, the O-H could be from the ester's alcohol, but wait, esters don't have O-H unless it's a free acid. Wait, no. The O-H in the FTIR suggests an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. So if the compound is an ester, why is there an O-H? Unless it's an ester with a hydroxyl group elsewhere.

Hmm. So perhaps the structure is a diol ester, but that complicates.

Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with a hydroxyl group. But ketones don't have O-H unless there's another group.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond could lower the carbonyl stretching frequency. So the 1700 and 1650 could be from a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But then, the O-H would be from an alcohol, but if it's a lactone, it's an ester. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me go back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45. Let's think about what formulas can lose a 45 fragment. For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight is 114. If it loses 45, what's left is 69. 69 could be the molecular weight of, say, CH2=CHCH2O (not a real molecule, but a possible fragment). Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion (CH2=C=O), which is 45 (12*2 + 3*1 + 16 = 24+3+16=43. Hmm, no. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH3COO+ group. Wait, molecular weight of CH3COO is 59 (12*2 +3 +16*2=24+3+32=59). No, that's larger than 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2=CH-O- group. The molecular weight of that would be 43 (12*2 + 2*1 + 16=24+2+16=42? Not exactly 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester, but
