Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. 

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, the molecular formula might give me some clues about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-10)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring plus a double bond and so on. 

Looking at the NMR data. Let me list the peaks:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet around 9.7. High ppm like that, maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it can also be an acidic proton, maybe from a phenol, but phenols are usually broader and maybe not a triplet. Hmm. Or perhaps an enal, where the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond. 

Next, 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) – doublet, two protons. Could be aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring. Like para-substituted where two protons are adjacent to substituents. 

6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – another doublet, two protons. Also aromatic. Maybe a coupling with a substituent. 

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, two protons. Broad usually indicates exchange, like OH protons, but it's 2H? Maybe a phenolic group or some conjugated double bond with adjacent protons. Or perhaps it's a vinyl proton that's exchanging, but that's less likely. Wait, but 6.27 is upfield for aromatic protons. Maybe it's not aromatic. Could it be an ene (like CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl), but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ring where the protons are in a different position. 

3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – a doublet of two protons. That's a CH2 group adjacent to something. Maybe an OCH2 group, because those are often around 3.5-4 ppm. Like an ether or ester. Or maybe a CH2 attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen. 

Putting this together: the NMR suggests perhaps a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let's think about the possible structure. 

The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet. If it's an aldehyde, it's probably not a triplet because aldehyde protons typically couple with adjacent protons if any. Wait, unless it's an enal, where the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond. Like RCH=CHCHO. But in that case, the aldehyde would be on a terminal, maybe not coupled to two protons. Wait, but in a conjugated system, maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a double bond, so the H could be next to a CH2 or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde, like benzaldehyde, but in a more complex structure. 

The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each have two protons. Possibly two para-substituted benzene rings. Let me think: if there's a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions, the protons on adjacent carbons would be doublets. So maybe two para-substituted rings are present. But wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two different rings. Or perhaps one ring where the substitution is such that the protons are split into two doublets. 

The 6.27 ppm could be a pair of protons that are part of a conjugated system. Maybe in between two carbonyl groups or adjacent to an oxygen. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted vinyl group. 

The 3.66 (d, 2H) is likely a CH2 group next to an oxygen. For example, maybe an OCH2CH2 group. But wait, the doublet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, that doesn't fit if it's OCH2. Unless it's a CH2 attached to another CH2, which is attached to something else. 

Putting it all together, maybe the structure is a di-substituted benzene with another group attached. Let's think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let me count the atoms. So 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 N, 1 O. 

If it's something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents, maybe with a phenyl group attached via a chain. Let's think: If there's a benzaldehyde group (PhCHO), that's C7H6O. Then the remaining part should be C1H3NO. Hmm, that doesn't quite add up. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde is PhCH2CHO. But wait, that would be C9H8O. The formula here is C8H9NO. Hmm, so maybe that's not it. 

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with a side chain that includes an amine or an amide group. Oh wait, the formula includes an N. So, perhaps a benzaldehyde with an amine substituent. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted acetophenone but with an aldehyde group. Hmm, not sure. 

Wait, another approach: the reaction steps. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: That's usually for diazotization. So the compound must have a group that can undergo diazotization, which is typically an aromatic amine (like aniline). 

2. H2O: Diazonium salt hydrolysis. Depending on conditions, this can form phenol or a carboxylic acid. But since the next step is aqueous KOH and heat, which is basic conditions, perhaps the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed in a basic aqueous solution. 

Wait, the steps are: 

1. Diazotization (form diazonium salt)
2. Hydrolysis with water (maybe acid or base conditions)
3. Treatment with aq KOH and heat.

Wait, step 3: aqueous KOH and heat. That's typical for elimination reactions, perhaps for forming alkenes via elimination of an alcohol or other groups. 

Wait, but let's think about the first two steps. Diazonium salt hydrolysis. If the starting compound has a benzene ring with an amino group (like aniline), then step 1 forms the diazonium chloride. Step 2 is hydrolysis. 

In acidic hydrolysis (like with H2O and H+), the diazonium salt may form a phenol. But if the hydrolysis is done with aqueous KOH (step 2?), that would be basic conditions. Wait, the second step is H2O. Maybe that's a workup or just the first hydrolysis. Or perhaps it's an intermediate step. 

Wait, perhaps after diazotization, the diazonium chloride is subjected to hydrolysis. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis under acidic (like H2SO4, heat) or basic (like NaOH, heat) conditions. 

In acidic hydrolysis, the diazonium salt typically forms a phenol. In basic conditions, it might form a phenoxide. 

But in any case, perhaps the starting material is an aryl amine, which upon diazotization and hydrolysis gives a phenol. 

Then step 3 is aq KOH and heat. That could be a condition for elimination, like an E2 mechanism, forming a double bond. So perhaps the molecule has a hydroxyl group adjacent to a carbon that can lose a proton and form a double bond. 

Wait, but let's go back to the NMR data. The NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H). That's a high ppm, maybe an aldehyde. So if the starting material has an aldehyde group, but then the reaction steps might convert that. Or perhaps, the starting material is a secondary amine that upon diazotization and hydrolysis forms something else. 

Wait, perhaps the compound is an acetophenone derivative with an amino group. Or maybe the starting material is a benzylamine derivative. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Molecular formula would be C7H7NO. But the given formula is C8H9NO. So that's C8, which is one more C. So maybe it's a propyl chain attached somewhere. 

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is something like 4-aminophenylacetone. Wait, let's calculate. 4-aminobenzylacetone would be:

Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH3? No, that would be C9H11NO. Hmm, the given formula is C8H9NO, so maybe that's not it. 

Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is phenethylamine derivative with an aldehyde. Let's think: perhaps it's 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a methyl group or ethyl group. 

Wait, 4-aminobenzaldehyde is C7H7NO. So to get to C8H9NO, perhaps there's another carbon. Maybe an ethyl group. Like ethyl group attached to something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenylprop-2-enal (CH2=CHCHO attached to benzene). That would be C9H8NO, which is over. Hmm. 

This is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps again. 

The first step: NaNO2 and HCl. So that's making a diazonium salt. The second step: H2O. Maybe hydrolyzing the diazonium salt. If the starting compound is a benzene ring with an amino group, then after hydrolysis, it becomes a phenol. 

Then step 3 is aqueous KOH and heat. That's likely an elimination reaction. So perhaps the phenol is part of a structure where the hydroxyl group is beta to a leaving group, which upon treatment with base would eliminate to form a double bond. 

Alternatively, perhaps the product after step 2 is a phenol, and then step 3 is some kind of oxidation or elimination. 

Wait, combining the NMR data with the reaction steps. Let's try to imagine the structure. 

We have an aldehyde proton at 9.72 ppm as a triplet. That suggests that the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Because a triplet would mean it's coupling with two neighboring protons. So the structure might be R-CH2-CHO. So the H on the CH2 would be adjacent to the aldehyde. So the aldehyde is at the end, and the CH2 is next to it. 

But in the NMR, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for two protons. If that's a CH2 group, perhaps it's attached to something else. Maybe an oxygen. So perhaps it's OCH2CH2CHO? But then the CH2 attached to O would be split into a quartet if next to another CH2, but here it's a doublet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is next to a CH. 

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO. No, that would have more carbons. Or perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each have two H. Maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. For example, in the starting material, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is the amino group (before reaction), and another is a CH2CH2CHO group or similar. 

Let me think about the starting material. The starting compound has molecular formula C8H9NO and the NMR data. 

Wait, another thought: the 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be a pair of protons on a benzene ring that are ortho to substituents. But then why are they broad? Or perhaps they are on a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen. 

Wait, if the structure is something like 4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal. Let's see: but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. But then attaching to a benzene. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that may not fit the NMR. Or wait, maybe it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with the aldehyde at the end. 

Alternatively, maybe it's Ph-CH2-CHO, which would be benzaldehyde with a CH2 group. But that would be C8H8O, but the formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 N, 1 O. So for example, 4-aminobenzaldehyde would be C7H7NO. Then, if there's an ethyl group attached somewhere else, perhaps. Or maybe a methyl group attached. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with an amino group and another substituent. Let me try to imagine the NMR. 

The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is probably the aldehyde. The aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group (since it's a triplet), so maybe the structure is CH2-CHO attached to something. 

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is likely the CH2 next to the aldehyde. So it's R-CH2-CHO. So R is likely a benzene ring with substituents. 

So the structure could be Ph-CH2-CHO. But then, what about the other signals? 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex, like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 groups would be in the middle. 

But let's think about the NMR. The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each with two H. That suggests two sets of para-substituted aromatic protons. Maybe the benzene ring has two substituents, one in para position to each other. 

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with another substituent. Let me think. 

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a secondary amine attached to a benzene ring. But the reaction steps involve diazotization, which requires an aromatic amine, typically aniline derivatives. 

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminophenylpropenal. Let me draw that: the benzene ring with an amino group at position 4 and a propenal group (CH2=CHCHO). Hmm, but the molecular formula would be C9H9N O. Wait, that's one more carbon than given. So perhaps that's not it. 

Alternatively, maybe the structure is 4-aminobenzyl acetone. But no, that might not fit. 

Alternatively, the starting material has an amino group on a benzene ring and a propyl group with an aldehyde. So, perhaps 4-aminobenzaldehyde with another substituent. 

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps again and what the final product would be. 

The reaction steps are:

1. Diazotization (NaNO2, HCl) → forms diazonium chloride.
2. Hydrolysis (H2O) → forms phenol.
3. Aqueous KOH, heat → perhaps elimination or other reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Then, after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Then, step 3: treatment with aqueous KOH and heat. What would that do? 

Hydroxyl groups can undergo elimination under basic conditions if adjacent to a leaving group. But 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde doesn't have a leaving group. Alternatively, maybe there's another substituent. 

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenylacetone. Structure would be Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH3, but then after reaction steps, it would change. Hmm. 

Alternatively, if the starting material is 4-aminobenzyl alcohol: Ph-CH2-OH. But wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate: C8H9NO. So, benzene (6 C) + CH2-OH + NH2? Wait, that would be more than 8 C. 

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzyl chloride, but that's a different molecular formula. 

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is 4-aminophenyl propenoate. Not sure. 

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenyl acrylate. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. Wait, but that would be C9H9NO. Hmm. 

Wait, another angle. The NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) which is likely the aldehyde proton. The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be the CH2 adjacent to the aldehyde. So perhaps the structure is R-CH2-CHO, where R is a benzene ring. 

So, R is Ph-CH2-CHO. Wait, but the molecular formula would be C8H8O, which doesn't match C8H9NO. So perhaps the R group is more substituted. 

Wait, maybe R is a benzene ring with an NH2 substituent. So the structure is 4-aminophenyl-CH2-CHO. That would be C8H9NO. Let me count: benzene (6 C) + CH2-CHO (2 C) + NH2 (1 N, but attached to the benzene). So molecular formula would be C8H9NO. Yes! 

So the structure would be 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-CH2-CHO, with the amino group on the benzene ring at para position. 

Now, the NMR data:

- The aldehyde proton (CHO) is at 9.72 ppm as a triplet. That makes sense because the CH2 adjacent to the CHO has two hydrogens. So the aldehyde proton is coupled with the two H on CH2, giving a triplet. 

- The CH2 group (Ph-CH2-) would be around 3.66 ppm, as a doublet because it's next to the CHO group's single proton. Wait, no, the CH2 is next to the CHO, which has one proton. So the CH2 would be a triplet because each H on CH2 is adjacent to the CHO's H. But wait, the 3.66 is a doublet. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. 

Wait, the coupling for the CH2 would be with the adjacent CHO H. If the CH2 is -CH2-CHO, then each CH2 H is adjacent to one H (from CHO). So the CH2 would be a quartet because each H on CH2 would couple with the single H on CHO, but wait, the CH2 has two H, each coupling with the same H on CHO. So perhaps each CH2 H would couple with the single H, leading to a triplet for the CH2. But in the NMR, it's a doublet. Hmm, perhaps I have the structure wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is part of an OCH2 group. For example, OCH2CH2CHO. Then, the OCH2 would be at around 3.66 ppm, as a doublet. How? Because the OCH2 would be next to another CH2 group. Each H on OCH2 would couple with the two H on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet. Hmm. Maybe the OCH2 is connected to another group. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, a ketone. But the aldehyde is at 9.72, so maybe that's not it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO. But that would have more carbons. 

Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO. 

In that case, the H on the CH2 would be next to the CHO, which has one proton. So each H on
