Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal lattice can be calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. Oh right, the formula involves the reciprocal of the lattice parameter and the Miller indices. Wait, the general formula is something like 1/d² equals the sum of the squares of the Miller indices times some terms involving the angles.

Wait, the formula for a general rhombohedral system. So in a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges are of equal length, a, and all the angles are equal, alpha, beta, gamma. Oh right, the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) ), where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, no, no. I think it's a bit different. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(180 - alpha) ), but no, wait, because in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is based on vectors with the same length a and angles alpha between each pair. So the formula for d is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the vectors, which in this case is 30 degrees.

Wait, but wait, the angle in the formula is the angle between the lattice vectors, right? So in a rhombohedral system, all the angles between the vectors are the same, alpha. So yes, alpha is 30 degrees here.

So the general formula for the interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(alpha) )

Wait, but wait, I've also heard that in some contexts the formula uses the cosine of the angle between the lattice vectors,
