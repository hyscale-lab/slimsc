Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal too. So, in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance. Oh right, that's the d-spacing. The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2hk cos α)/(h² + k²) + ... ) wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms here. Oh wait, no, the general formula for d-spacing in a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles α, β, γ is a bit more involved.

Wait, I think the general formula when the lattice isn't cubic is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/a² + ... ) but I'm probably not getting that right. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is a bit specific. I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been distorted, but maybe that's not the right way to think about it.

Another approach. The general formula for d-spacing is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + ... but wait, that's for the cubic case. No, wait, when the crystal is not cubic, the formula includes terms involving the angles between the lattice vectors. Oh right, the formula is given by the reciprocal of the square root of [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ] divided by a². So:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees here. So, substituting that in, the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ), where θ is 30 degrees.

In this problem, the crystal is rhombohedral, so a, the lattice parameter, is the interatomic distance? Wait, no, wait. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors, so the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait a second—is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter in a rhombohedral structure? Hmm, I think so because in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter is the interatomic distance. So, if the structure is primitive, then yes. But sometimes, especially in non-cubic systems, the interatomic distance might not be the same as a. But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so I guess a is 10 Angstrom.

So, the (111) plane means h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging these into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*( (1*1) + (1*1) + (1*1) ) * cos(30°) )

So calculating the numerator first: 1+1+1=3.

The denominator inside the sqrt is 3 + 2*(3) * cos(30°). Because (hk + hl + kl) is 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3.

So:

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 + 6 * cos(30°)

Cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So 3 + 5.196 ≈ 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ let's see, 8.196 is between 9^2=81 and 8^2=64, wait no, wait 8.196 is 8.196. Wait sqrt(8.196) is approximately sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863. Because 2.86^2 = 8.18 (2.86 * 2.86 = 8.1796). So approximately 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ approximately 3.491 Angstrom? Wait, wait a second, that can't be right. Because 10 divided by 2.8 is about 3.57. Hmm, but looking at the options given, the choices are all around 9 or 10 Angstroms. So clearly, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Maybe I messed up the denominator. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system can be written as d = a / sqrt( 1 + 2 cos α ) when h=k=l=1? Because for (111) plane, the Miller indices are all 1.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think about the general expression for a rhombohedral system. The general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system (all a = b = c, α = β = γ) is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, no, perhaps I should go back to the Miller indices and the structure factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α)/(a²) ?

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

I think the correct formula for the interplanar spacing d in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) + (2hk cos γ)/(a b) + (2hl cos β)/(a c) + (2kl cos α)/(b c)

But in this case, since it's a rhombohedral crystal, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So substituting, the formula simplifies to:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α / a²

Because all a, b, c are the same and all angles are same.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting:

1/d² = (3)/(10^2) + 2*(3)*(cos 30°)/(10^2)

Compute each term: 3/100 = 0.03

3 cos 30° is 3*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 3*0.8660 ≈ 2.598

So 2*3*cos 30° is 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196. Divided by 10^2 (100) → 5.196/100 = 0.05196.

So sum is 0.03 + 0.05196 = 0.08196.

So 1/d² = 0.08196 → d² = 1 / 0.08196 ≈ 12.205 → d ≈ sqrt(12.205) ≈ 3.492 Angstrom.

Wait, that's the same result as before. But none of the options are close to 3.49 Angstrom. All the options are around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I messed up the units? Wait, no, the interatomic distance is 10 A, so a =10 A.

Wait, I'm getting d ≈ 3.49 A, but the options are 8.95, 9.08, etc. So I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe I should think about the reciprocal lattice or another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system in terms of the lattice parameter and the angles. Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedron can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1 + 2 cos α) )

Wait, because for (111), h=k=l=1, so:

d = a / sqrt(1 + 2 cos α + 2 cos α + 2 cos α )? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine the formula.

In a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So for (111), h=k=l=1:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*(3) cos α )

Which is a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos α )

With a=10, alpha=30 degrees.

So, 3 + 6 * cos(30) = 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3 sqrt(3) ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863. So d=10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

But that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-read the question.

Question says: interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Hmm. Wait, what if the interatomic distance is not a? Because in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance could be along the a-axis, but perhaps the interplanar distance formula uses a different parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h k + h l + k l) * 2 cos α ) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when angles are acute, cos is positive, but if the formula is like that, it might give a larger denominator, making d smaller. But earlier, I'm getting d as 3.49, which is not matching the options.

Wait, maybe I got the angles wrong. Wait, the angles in a rhombohedral system are the angles between the edges in the unit cell, so in this case, each is 30 degrees. But perhaps in the formula, the angles used are the supplement angles or something else. Wait, no, I think the formula uses the actual angles.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the unit cell is rhombohedral, but the interatomic distance is along the a, b, c vectors, which are not necessarily orthogonal. So in this case, maybe the interatomic distance is not a, but the distance between two adjacent atoms along a vector, which might require a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that's what I used earlier, but perhaps it's actually:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that would change things. Let me try that.

So in that case, for (111):

Denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 2*(3)*(0.866) = 3 - 5.196 ≈ -2.196.

Wait, but I can't have a negative inside the square root. So that can't be right. So that formula must be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure more carefully. A rhombohedral system can be considered as a cube stretched along the space diagonals, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance for a crystal can be found using the plane
