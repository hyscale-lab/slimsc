Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, so I guess that means their density is constant in space. Uniform distribution implies that the number density (stars per unit volume) doesn't change with distance. So, more distant regions have the same number of stars per cubic parsec, for example.

Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is distance d = 1/plx, right? So when plx increases, the star is closer; when plx decreases, the star is farther away.

The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So like, for a given range of plx (say from plx to plx + d plx), how does the number of stars in that range vary as plx changes.

Wait, so I think I should model this. Let's say N is the number of stars in a thin shell between parallax p and p + dp. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars should depend on the volume of that shell.

Let me think about the volume. Each shell at a particular distance d has a volume that's a sphere's surface area times a thin radial shell. So the volume element would be 4πd² dd, where d is the distance. Because the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. Oh wait, right, that's correct.

But parallax p is 1/d. So d = 1/p. So I can express everything in terms of p. Let's see, d = 1/p, so dd/dp = -1/(p²). So dd = -dp/(p²). Hmm, so when p increases (star is closer), d decreases, etc.

So the number of stars in a shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume of the shell. Since the number density is uniform, let's say n is a constant.

So N = n * 4π d² dd.

Substituting d = 1/p, so d² is (1/p)². And dd is -(dp)/(p²), but since we're looking at a small dp, the negative just indicates direction, but since we're considering absolute number, we can take the positive. So N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (dp / p²) )?

Wait, wait, let's plug in properly. So:

d = 1/p → dd = - dp / p².

So the volume element is 4π d² dd. Substituting:

4π (1/p)^2 * (-dp / p^2) ) → 4π (1/p²) ( - dp / p² ). The negative just indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but for our purposes, the magnitude is what matters.

So 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But the number of stars in that volume is n times that, so N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but
