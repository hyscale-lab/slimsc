Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. Both are moving in the same direction, positive x-axis. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, when objects are moving at speeds comparable to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their speeds normally. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't add like classical mechanics. So I can't just do 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. That's probably wrong because of the Lorentz transformations.

So how do you compute relative velocity in special relativity? I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Let me get that right. Oh wait, if astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c and astronaut B at v = 0.5c, then the relative speed of B as seen from A's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait—no, wait. Wait, I think the formula is for the velocity of an object moving at v in the frame where the spaceship is moving at u. So if we're in the frame of the first astronaut, the second's velocity would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, let's clarify. The problem asks for the relative speed of one as seen from the other. So if astronaut B is moving at 0.5c as observed from the Earth, and astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, then in A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the velocity addition formula. The formula to find the speed of B from A's frame (since A is moving at u = 0.6c in Earth's frame) is:

v' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²))

Wait no. Wait, if the Earth sees A moving at u, then in A's frame, the Earth is moving at -u. So to find the speed of B in A's frame, which is moving at u in Earth's frame, the speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²). Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B is moving at 0.5c (same direction), then from A's perspective, B is moving slower. So the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But since speed is magnitude, it would be 0.1428c. So about 0.14c, which is roughly option C or D.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that narrows it down between C and D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm, each astronaut has relativistic energy, so we need to calculate their energies and sum them. The total energy E is the sum of the energies of each astronaut.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2 (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². Hmm, approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So that would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Gamma1: 0.6c.

v=0.6c, so v²/c² = 0.36. 1 -0.36 =0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. 1/0.8=1.25. Correct. So E1 =1.25 *2m c²=2.5 mc².

Gamma2: v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)= (√3)/2≈0.8660. So 1/0.8660≈1.1547. Correct. So E2=1.1547 *3m c²=3.4641 mc².

Total E=2.5 +3.4641 =5.9641 mc². So approx 5.96 mc².

So looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that's the correct pair.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{v u}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \( 2m \), speed = \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \( 3m \), speed = \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.9641m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
