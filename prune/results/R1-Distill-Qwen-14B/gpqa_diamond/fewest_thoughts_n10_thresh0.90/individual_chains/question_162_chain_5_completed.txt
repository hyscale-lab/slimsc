Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that seems a bit unusual. I remember that metrics usually have terms with different coefficients for each dx and dy, but this looks like it's multiplied by a scalar function. Oh right, this is a two-dimensional metric—maybe it's written in conformally flat coordinates. So the line element is conformally related to the Euclidean metric. That makes sense because the function is just scaling the flat metric.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, I'm a bit confused about pseudospheres. From what I remember, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But how does that relate to the metric given here?

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'pseudosphere' here refers to a sphere in a space with different geometry. Oh wait, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere might be a hyperbolic space. So, maybe the metric describes a hyperbolic plane or something similar.

Wait, the area of a sphere in different spaces depends on the curvature. For example, in Euclidean space, the area of a sphere is 4πr². But in hyperbolic space, the area increases without bound as the radius increases, but here the radius is fixed at 2. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the metric again. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So the metric function is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the line element is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr², assuming r² is x² + y². Wait, because in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r². Oh wait, but the metric is in terms of dx² + dy², so maybe it's written in 2D Cartesian coordinates. But I can convert to polar coordinates for easier analysis.

Let me try that. In polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². But wait, no, the metric given doesn't have the θ term yet. Wait, no, the given metric is only for dx² and dy², so perhaps it's written in 2D with x and y coordinates. So the line element is:

ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

Which can be written as:

ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²) ?

Wait, no, because x² + y² = r² in polar coordinates, but the given metric is written in terms of dx² and dy², not in polar coordinates. So maybe I can consider this as a 2-dimensional metric with coordinates x and y, but it's conformally flat because the coefficient is a function of x and y.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. So what's the definition of the pseudosphere's area in this metric?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some space. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the metric is for a 2-dimensional space, and the pseudosphere is a 1-dimensional sphere embedded in this space. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the area of a sphere in a given metric is computed by integrating the area element over the sphere. The area element in the metric is sqrt(g) dx dy, but that's for the volume element in 2D.

Wait, the area of a sphere in a 2D space would be the circumference, I think. Because in 3D, a sphere has surface area, but in 2D (like a plane), a 'sphere' is a circle, so its 'area' would be the circumference.

Wait, but the metric given is 2-dimensional, so perhaps the pseudosphere is a circle in this space. So the 'radius' here refers to some measure of the circle's size in this space.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using 'pseudosphere' to refer to a 2-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature, which is topologically equivalent to a cylinder.

Wait, let me think about the metric. The denominator is (4 - x^2 - y^2). So the metric is singular when x² + y² =4, which would be a circle of radius 2. So the metric is defined for points where x² + y² <4. So the space is like a disk of radius 2. But what about the behavior near the edge?

The coefficient 32/(4 - r²) becomes large as r approaches 2. So the geometry is such that the curvature becomes strong near the edge. Hmm.

But how does this relate to the area of a pseudosphere? Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere is a circle (in 2D) with a certain radius in this metric. So the area would be the integral of the area element over that circle.

Wait, in a conformally flat metric, the area element is just the conformal factor times the flat area element. So in this case, the area element would be [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. Wait, no, the area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dx dy. For a metric g = E dx² + G dy² + ... but here, since it's conformally flat, the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)]². So sqrt of that is 32/(4 - r²). So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

But wait, maybe I should calculate the Gaussian curvature to find the area. Because for a surface with constant curvature, the area of a circle of radius r is 2π r h(r), where h(r) is the circumference density, which depends on the curvature.

Alternatively, for a surface with constant Gaussian curvature K, the area A of a circle of radius r is:

If K=0 (Euclidean), A=2πr².

Wait, no, wait. In Euclidean geometry, the area is π r², but that's when you're integrating in flat space. Wait, no, in 2D, the area of a circle is π r²? No, wait, in 2D Euclidean space, a circle of radius r has area π r²? No, no. Oh wait, no: in 2D, the area of a circle is π r², but I'm getting confused because in 3D, a sphere's surface area is 4π r².

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. For a 2D surface (like a plane), the area is in terms of a disk. So a disk of radius r has area π r². But in a space with non-zero curvature, the area would be different.

So for a space with Gaussian curvature K, the area of a circle of radius r is A = 2π r [r - (1/(2K)) (1 - cos(√|K| r)) ] for K positive or negative. Wait, I think I'm getting this from somewhere. Alternatively, I remember that for a surface of constant negative curvature K, the area of a circle of radius r is A = 2π r^2 / (1 - (r^2/(4R^2))) where R is some radius? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric and then find the area of a circle (pseudosphere) with radius 2.

Gaussian curvature K can be found for a conformally flat metric. The formula for K in terms of the conformal factor is something I need to recall. Oh right, in 2D, the Gaussian curvature for a metric g = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²) is given by K = -e^{-2φ} [ (Δ φ) + ( (∇φ)^2 ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute the Ricci scalar. Wait, in 2D, the Ricci scalar is equal to the Gaussian curvature. So for a metric g_{μν} = e^{2φ} η_{μν}, where η is flat, the Ricci scalar R is given by:

R = 4 e^{-2φ} [ ( (∇² φ) ) + (∇φ)^2 ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula for a conformal metric.

The formula for the Gaussian curvature K of a conformal metric g = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²) is:

K = - (1/2) e^{-2φ} [ 4 e^{2φ} (det ∇² φ) - (e^{2φ} ... ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 e^{2φ})) [ (e^{2φ})_{,ij} e^{2φ} } ] where commas are derivatives.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the Christoffel symbols, then the Riemann tensor, then the Ricci scalar. But that might take too long. Let me see if there's a simpler way.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r² = x² + y². So in polar coordinates, r is the radial coordinate, and θ is the angular coordinate.

So the metric is:

g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²)
g_{θθ} = (32 r²)/(4 - r²)
g_{rθ} = 0

The Gaussian curvature K for a metric in polar coordinates can be calculated using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ (g_{rr})'_{,θ} - (g_{rθ})_{,r} } / (g_{θθ}) ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think of a better formula.

Alternatively, the formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates (r, θ) is:

K = - [ (g_{rr,r} g_{θθ} - g_{rr} g_{θθ, θ} ) / (2 g_{θθ}) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the general formula for 2D metrics. In 2D, the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = (1/(2√g)) [ ∂(√g g^{θθ} g_{rr,θ}) / ∂θ - ∂(√g g^{rθ} g_{θθ,r}) / ∂r ]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to compute the Gaussian curvature for a metric that's conformally flat.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of the conformal factor. Let me write it as g = e^{2φ} (dr² + r² dθ²), where φ is a function of r.

In this case, φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)) ?

Wait, wait, let me compute e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - r²). So φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

Now, the Gaussian curvature K for a conformally flat metric is given by:

K = - e^{-2φ} [ ( (e^{2φ})_{,rr} + ( (e^{2φ})_{,θθ} ) / r² ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to use a known formula. I think the Gaussian curvature for a metric ds² = e^{2φ} (dr² + r² dθ²) is:

K = - e^{-2φ} [ (φ_r)^2 + (φ_r)_{,r} + (φ_θ)^2 / r² + (φ_θ)_{,θ} / r² ]

But since φ depends only on r, φ_θ is zero. So:

K = - e^{-2φ} [ (φ_r)^2 + φ_{rr} ]

Wait, because φ is a function of r only. So:

Compute φ_r = dφ/dr = (1/2) [ ( - (r) * (32)' ) / (4 - r²) ) ] ? Wait, let me compute φ correctly.

Wait, e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - r²), so φ = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²)

Therefore, φ_r = derivative of φ with respect to r = (1/2) * [ (0) - ( (-2r) / (4 - r^2) ) ] = (1/2) * [ (2 r) / (4 - r^2) ) ] = r/(4 - r^2)

So φ_r = r/(4 - r^2)

Now, φ_{rr} is derivative of φ_r with respect to r.

d/dr [ r/(4 - r^2) ) ] = [ (4 - r²)(1) + r (2r) ] / (4 - r^2)^2

= [4 - r² + 2 r² ] / (4 - r^2)^2

= (4 + r²) / (4 - r^2)^2

So now, putting into the formula for K:

K = - e^{-2φ} [ (φ_r)^2 + φ_{rr} ]

e^{-2φ} is the inverse of e^{2φ}, which is (4 - r²)/32.

So e^{-2φ} = (4 - r²)/32.

So K = - (4 - r^2)/32 [ ( r^2/(4 - r^2)^2 ) + ( (4 + r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ) ]

Let me compute the terms inside the brackets:

(φ_r)^2 = [ r/(4 - r^2) ]^2 = r²/(4 - r²)^2

φ_{rr} = (4 + r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2

Adding these together:

r²/(4 - r^2)^2 + (4 + r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2 = [ r² +4 + r² ] / (4 - r^2)^2 = (4 + 2 r²) / (4 - r^2)^2

So now, K becomes:

K = - (4 - r^2)/32 * [ (4 + 2 r^2) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) ] 

Simplifying:

= - (4 + 2 r^2) / [32 (4 - r^2) ]

Factor 2 from numerator:

= - [ 2 (2 + r²) ) ] / [ 32 (4 - r^2) ) ]

Simplify 2/32 = 1/16:

= - (2 + r²) / [ 16 (4 - r^2) ) ]

Hmm, that seems complicated, but let's see if it simplifies further.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the denominator after adding is (4 - r^2)^2.

In the numerator, when adding r^2 +4 + r^2, that's 4 + 2 r^2.

So the term inside the brackets is (4 + 2 r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2.

Then, multiplying by (4 - r^2)/32:

K = - (4 - r^2)/32 * (4 + 2 r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2 

= - (4 + 2 r^2) / [ 32 (4 - r^2) ) ]

So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, that's still a bit messy. Let me see if it can be simplified.

Wait, 4 + 2 r^2 = 2(2 + r^2), so:

K = - [ 2 (2 + r^2) ) ] / [32 (4 - r^2) ) ] 

= - (2 + r^2) / [ 16 (4 - r^2) )

Hmm, but I don't see a further simplification.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the pseudosphere is a circle with radius r=2. But wait, looking back, our r in the metric is the radial coordinate, and the denominator 4 - r^2 would be zero when r=2. So the metric is singular at r=2. So the pseudosphere might be the boundary at r=2.

Wait, but the metric isn't defined at r=2, but perhaps the pseudosphere is embedded there as the limit.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere is a surface in this space with a certain radius, and we need to compute its area using the metric.

Wait, the area of a circle in a space with Gaussian curvature K is given by:

A = 2π r [ r - ( (1/(√|K|)) ) * (1 - cos(√|K| r)) ) ]

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the formula. Alternatively, I remember for a space with constant curvature K, the area of a circle of radius r is:

If K=0: A = π r²

If K>0: A = (π r²)/(sinh²(√K r)) )? No, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: The circumference of a circle in a space with Gaussian curvature K is C = 2π r / sqrt(1 + (K r^2)/(4))), maybe? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps using the metric, the circumference (which would be the "area" of a 1-sphere, the circle) can be found. Because in 2D, the circumference of a circle is 2π r, but with the metric scaling, it would be different.

Wait, the circumference of a circle of radius r in this metric would be the integral of dθ multiplied by the coefficient of dθ². Wait, no: the circumference is found by integrating ds along the circle. So for a circle at a fixed r, the circumference would be the integral over θ from 0 to 2π of sqrt(g_{θθ}) dθ.

So g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²)

So the circumference C is ∫0^2π sqrt(g_{θθ}) dθ = ∫0^2π sqrt(32 r^2/(4 - r^2)) dθ = 2π * sqrt(32 r²/(4 - r²)) )

= 2π * [ r sqrt(32) ] / sqrt(4 - r²) )

= 2π r (4 sqrt(2)) ) / sqrt(4 - r²) )

Hmm, because sqrt(32) is 4*sqrt(2).

So C = 2π r * (4 sqrt(2)) ) / sqrt(4 - r²) )

= 8 sqrt(2) π r / sqrt(4 - r²)

That's the circumference. But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the area is the integral of the circumference as r goes from 0 to 2.

Wait, but in 2D, the area would be the integral of the circumference over r from 0 to R, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps the area is calculated using the area element.

Wait, perhaps the area of the pseudosphere is the area of the circle of radius 2 in this metric. So using the metric, the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ. Wait, no, the area element in 2D is sqrt( determinant of the metric ) dr dθ.

The metric in polar coordinates is:

g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²)
g_{θθ} = (32 r²)/(4 - r²)
g_{rθ} = 0

So the determinant of the metric is g_{rr} * g_{θθ} - g_{rθ}^2 = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32)^2 r² / (4 - r²)^2

So sqrt(det g) = 32 r / (4 - r² )

Thus, the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

So the area A of a circle of radius R is the integral from 0 to R of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr, multiplied by the integral over θ from 0 to 2π, which is 2π.

So A = 2π ∫0^R [32 r / (4 - r²) ] dr

Let's compute that integral.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4.

When r=R, u=4 - R².

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r^2 ) = ∫ (32) (-du/2) / u = -16 ∫ du / u = -16 ln |u| + C.

So evaluating from 0 to R:

A = 2π * [ -16 ln(4 - R^2) + 16 ln(4) ) ]

= 2π * [ 16 ( ln(4) - ln(4 - R^2) ) ]

= 32 π [ ln(4/(4 - R^2)) ]

So A = 32 π ln(4/(4 - R^2)) )

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So R=2.

Substituting R=2:

A = 32 π ln(4/(4 - (2)^2)) = 32 π ln(4/(4-4)).

Wait, denominator becomes 0, so ln(4/0) → ln(infinity) → infinity.

So the area is 32 π ln(inf) → infinity.

Hmm, that suggests that the area is infinite.

But wait, in the metric, as r approaches 2, the area element blows up because the metric's denominator approaches zero. So the area of a circle with radius 2 would be infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because for a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, the area of a circle increases without bound as the radius increases. But in this case, the radius is fixed at 2, but the area could still be infinite if the curvature becomes too negative at that radius.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere in this metric is the entire space itself, which is a hyperbolic space, and thus has infinite area.

Wait, but the question says 'the pseudosphere of radius r=2.' So perhaps the area is infinite.

So the answer would be D) +infty.

But let me check my substitution again. When R=2, 4 - R^2 = 0, so the ln(4/(4-4)) = ln(infinite) which is infinite.

So the area would be infinite. So the correct answer is D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is conformally flat in 2D Cartesian coordinates. Converting to polar coordinates where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). In this context, the pseudosphere likely refers to a circle of radius \(r = 2\) embedded in the space described by the metric. The area element in this metric is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \(\det g = g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta} - g_{r\theta}^2\). For the given metric, \(\det g = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the area of the circle of radius \(r = 2\), we integrate \(dA\) over \(r\) from \(0\) to \(2\), and \(\theta\) from \(0\) to \(2\pi\):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral contributes a factor of \(2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \ln(4).
\]

Thus, the area is:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 16 \ln(4) = 32\pi \ln(4).
\]

However, as \(r\) approaches \(2\), the denominator \(4 - r^2\) approaches zero, causing the area element to diverge. This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

From the options provided:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area in the given metric.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area diverges due to the singularity at \(r = 2\).

Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
