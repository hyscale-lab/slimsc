Okay, so I need to figure out which Maxwell's equations would change if in a parallel universe, magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, this is about magnetism and Maxwell's equations, right?

Wait, in our universe, magnets always have both a North and South pole; you can't isolate them. Like, you can break a magnet into pieces, and each piece will have both poles, but not just a single North or South. But in this scenario, they can have isolated poles, so maybe the magnetic monopoles exist.

Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me think about each one and see which would change.

The first equation is Gauss's Law for electricity: divergence of E equals charge density over epsilon zero. That's about electric fields, so I don't think that changes here. Unless there's some modification due to magnetic charges, but maybe not directly.

The second equation is Gauss's Law for magnetism: divergence of B equals zero. Wait, that's because in our universe, magnetic monopoles don't exist. So if in this universe they do, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. So Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. Instead of ∇·B = 0, it might be something like ∇·B = rho_m, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density. So that equation definitely changes.

The third equation is Faraday's Law: curl of E equals negative the time derivative of B. That's about induced electric fields from changing magnetic fields. I'm not sure if this changes with monopoles. Maybe the sign or something else, but perhaps not the form. Or maybe not, since monopoles would affect how the fields behave, but Faraday's Law is about how B affects E. Hmm, maybe not the equation itself, but perhaps another equation.

The fourth equation is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: curl of H equals the time derivative of D plus the current density J. Oh wait, but in a universe with magnetic monopoles, there should be something about the divergence of E too. Wait no, Ampère's Law deals with H and D. Wait, but if magnetic charges exist, maybe there's an analogous term to how electric charges have a current. So perhaps the equation for the curl of E would change, or the equation for the divergence of E or B.

Wait, let's think about each equation again.

First equation: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ → unchanged because it's about electric charges, not magnetic.

Second equation: ∇·B = 0 → changes to ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (or something like that), so that equation is modified.

Third equation: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t → this might be affected. Wait, in our case, the equation is that the curl of E is negative the time derivative of B. If there are magnetic charges, perhaps Maxwell's equations would have a term similar to how electric currents appear in Ampère's law.

Wait, when you have magnetic current densities, maybe the Faraday's Law would pick up a term involving the magnetic current density. So maybe the equation becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (or something similar, depending on units). So that equation would change as well.

Fourth equation: ∇×H = ∂D/∂t + J → this is Ampère's Law. If there's a magnetic current, maybe the equation gains a term. Wait, in standard Maxwell's equations, there's no magnetic charge or current, so the divergence of B is zero. But if monopoles exist, perhaps there's an additional term involving the magnetic current.

Wait, another approach: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, two of Maxwell's equations change. The original equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_ε / ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×H = ∂D/∂t + J_ε + J_m (maybe not, depends on the formulation)

But wait, when you have magnetic charges, you also need to modify Ampère's Law. Because in Ampère's Law, you have the curl of H equal to the sum of the displacement current and the electric current. If there's a magnetic current, maybe there's another term added here. Or perhaps a different equation.

Wait, I think that when magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations are modified. The divergence of B is no longer zero, and the curl of E is not just about the time derivative of B but also includes a term about the magnetic current.

Wait, let's think about the four equations:

1. Gauss's law (E) → same.
2. Gauss's law (B) → changes to ∇·B = rho_m (assuming magnetic charge exists).
3. Faraday's law → originally ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. With magnetic monopoles, this might become ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (if J_m is the magnetic current density). So the equation changes.
4. Ampère's law → originally ∇×H = ∂D/∂t + J. With magnetic monopoles, maybe there's a similar term involving the magnetic current, but I'm not too sure. Wait, perhaps Ampère's law would pick up a term involving the time derivative of the magnetic current. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations gain symmetry. So the modified equations would include terms for magnetic current density in both Faraday's and Ampère's laws.

So, for Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (where J_m is the magnetic current density).

And for Ampère's Law: ∇×H = ∂D/∂t + J_e + ∂M_m/∂t, where M_m is the magnetic current? Or perhaps ∇×B = μ₀ (J_e + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) + something else. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that when magnetic monopoles exist, two Maxwell's equations change. Which two? The ones related to the divergence of B and the curl of E.

Wait, the question is which equations are different. So in our universe, equation 2 (∇·B=0) and equation 3 (∇×E= -∂B/∂t) are specific. But in a universe with magnetic monopoles, equation 2 would become ∇·B = some non-zero value, and equation 3 would have an additional term involving the magnetic current. So both equations 2 and 3 are modified.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says the divergence of the magnetic field. So only equation 2 is different. But I thought equation 3 also changes.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation (curl) of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So both equation 2 and 3 would be different. That's option B.

Option C: The circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. Wait, flux is about integrals, but I'm not sure. Or maybe flux refers to the integral of E over a surface. Not sure, but if this option is talking about ∇×B and ∇·E, then not correct.

Option D: The divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equations 2 and 3. Because equation 2 is divergence of B, equation 3 is curl of E. So both are modified.

Wait, earlier I thought both equation 2 and 3 are modified.

So what's the correct answer?

The question is asking, which equations are different. In the presence of isolated magnetic poles, which equations change.

In our universe, equation ∇·B =0, equation ∇×E=-∂B/∂t.

In a universe with monopoles, ∇·B = rho_m (non-zero), and ∇×E would include a term like J_m, so equation 3 changes. So both equations 2 and 3 are modified.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. Wait, no, because equation 2 is divergence of B, equation 3 is curl of E. So the equations that change are the divergence of B and the curl of E.

Wait, the options:

Option B: The ones related to the circulation (curl) of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So that would be equations 2 and 3.

Wait, no, equation 3 is about the curl of E being related to the time derivative of B. So if equation 3 changes, then yeah.

So the two equations that change would be equation 2 and equation 3.

Looking at the options, option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equation 3 and 2, the two that change.

Wait, but option D says the ones related to the divergence and curl of the magnetic field. So equation 2 is divergence of B, equation 3 is curl of E.

Wait, but equation 3 is about E, not B. So option D is talking about the divergence and curl of B. Which would be equations 2 and the curl of B, which is another equation. The curl of B is Ampère's Law plus Maxwell's term.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me rephrase:

Which equations change in a universe with isolated magnetic poles (magnetic monopoles)?

In our universe:

1. ∇·E = ρ_ε / ε₀ → unchanged.

2. ∇·B = 0 → changes to ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m.

3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t → changes to ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (if J_m is the magnetic current density).

4. ∇×H = ∂D/∂t + J_ε → perhaps remains the same, but in reality, with monopoles, maybe Ampère's Law picks up another term. Wait, no, Ampère's Law relates to the curl of H, which is about the electric current and displacement. So if magnetic currents exist, perhaps another equation is modified. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the curl of B is modified. Wait, in Maxwell's equations, the curl of B is ∇×B = μ₀ J_ε + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. But if there's a magnetic current, perhaps the equation becomes ∇×B = μ₀ J_ε + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + something else, like a term involving the magnetic current.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In our universe, the four Maxwell equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀.

2. ∇·B = 0.

3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t.

4. ∇×H = ∂D/∂t + J.

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, we'd have:

1. Same.

2. ∇·B = ρ_m (non-zero).

3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m.

4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_ε + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + something? Or maybe another equation?

Wait, I think that when you introduce magnetic monopoles, you add terms to Faraday's Law (equation 3) and to Ampère's Law (equation 4). Let me check.

Wait, Faraday's Law would have an extra term for the magnetic current. So equation 3 would change.

Ampère's Law would not change directly because it's about the curl of H. But perhaps there's another equation. Oh wait, perhaps the curl of E would have a term involving the magnetic current. So equation 3 is modified.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options say which equations are different. The options are:

A) divergence of B → equation 2 changes.

B) circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2).

C) circulation of B and flux of E. Not sure what flux of E refers to, maybe equation 1.

D) divergence and curl of B. So equation 2 and perhaps another equation about ∇×B.

Wait, in our universe, equation 4 is about ∇×H, but equation 2 is ∇·B. ∇×B is covered in equation 4 (but in a different form). So if equation 2 changes, and equation 3 changes, which is the case when magnetic monopoles exist, then which option covers those two?

Looking at the options, option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So equations 2 and 3.

Wait, so that would be option B.

Alternatively, option D says the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. That would be equation 2 (∇·B) and equation about ∇×B, which is equation 4. But equation 4 is about H, not B. So perhaps option D is not correct.

So, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, equation 2 and equation 3 are modified. Therefore, the correct option is B.


In a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles (magnetic monopoles), Maxwell’s equations would differ from our universe. In our universe, the absence of magnetic monopoles leads to specific forms of Maxwell’s equations, such as:

1. **Gauss’s Law for Electricity**:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
   \]  
   This equation remains unchanged because it deals with electric fields and charges.

2. **Gauss’s Law for Magnetism**:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
   \]  
   In a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would change to:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m
   \]  
   where \(\rho_m\) is the magnetic charge density. Thus, the divergence of the magnetic field is no longer zero.

3. **Faraday’s Law**:  
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
   \]  
   In a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would also change to include a term involving the magnetic current density (\(J_m\)):  
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - J_m
   \]  
   Therefore, the circulation of the electric field is modified.

4. **Ampère’s Law with Maxwell’s Addition**:  
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{J}
   \]  
   This equation primarily deals with electric currents and displacement fields. While magnetic monopoles might introduce additional terms elsewhere, this equation remains fundamentally unchanged in its current form.

From this analysis, the two Maxwell’s equations that are modified in a universe with magnetic monopoles are:  
- The **divergence of the magnetic field** (\(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}\)), and  
- The **circulation of the electric field** (\(\nabla \times \mathbf{E}\)).  

These correspond to **Gauss’s Law for Magnetism** and **Faraday’s Law**, respectively. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.**

Answer: B
