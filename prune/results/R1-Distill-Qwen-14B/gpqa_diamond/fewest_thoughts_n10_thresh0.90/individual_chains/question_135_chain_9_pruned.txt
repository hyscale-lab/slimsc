Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the possible decay channels of the boson X. The question gives me the Lagrangian, which tells me how the boson interacts with fermions. The boson's mass is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, those fermions must have a combined mass less than the boson's mass. So the sum of twice the fermion mass should be less than or equal to the boson mass. Wait, no, wait. Each fermion has mass m, so for a pair, it's 2m. So the boson's mass M must be >= 2m_fermion.

So, the boson X has mass 6 GeV. Let me list the fermion masses I know. 

Quarks: up and down are the lightest. Up quark is about 2.2 MeV, down about 4.7 MeV. Then strange is around 100 MeV, then charm at about 1.5 GeV, bottom at around 4.5 GeV, top is super heavy, like 173 GeV. 

Leptons: electron is about 0.5 MeV, muon ~105 MeV, tau ~1.78 GeV.

So for each possible fermion pair, calculate 2m_fermion and see if it's less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's go through each option.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, let's check each fermion pair:

b quark: mass ~4.5 GeV. 2*4.5=9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9. So X can't decay into b bbar because 6 <9, it's not allowed. So option A is wrong because it includes b bbar.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Check fermion masses:

c quark: 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6: allowed.

s quark: 100 MeV. 2*0.1=0.2 GeV ≤6: allowed.

u quark: 2.2 MeV. 2*0.0022≈0.0044 GeV <<6: allowed.

d quark: 4.7 MeV. 2*0.0047≈0.0094 GeV <<6: allowed.

tau: 1.78 GeV. 2*1.78=3.56 GeV ≤6: allowed. So tau is allowed.

muon: 105 MeV. 2*0.105=0.21 GeV ≤6: allowed.

electron: negligible, allowed.

So all these pairs have 2m_fermion ≤6 GeV. So option B includes all these. But wait, what about the c quark? Because charm is 1.5 GeV, 2*1.5=3 GeV which is okay. So X can decay into c cbar.

So option B lists c cbar, which is allowed. So why isn't option B the answer?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse this correctly.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f \bar{
