Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Michael addition problem. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The question has three parts: (A), (B), and (C), each involving different reactants and reagents. I need to determine the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Let's start with part (A). The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the reagents.

From what I remember, the Michael addition is a reaction where a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The enolate acts as a nucleophile, and the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the electrophilic part.

In this case, dimethyl malonate is a good source of an enolate. It's a diethyl malonate derivative, but with two methyl groups. Under basic conditions (NaOEt is a strong base), the malonate would lose a proton to form an enolate. The enolate would then attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CHCO2Me, but with the substituents in the E configuration. Wait, no, let me think again. The formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Hmm, no, wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2? Wait, the structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate must have the structure (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO2Me? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2R, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the substituent here is at the 3-position. So the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO2Me? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent on the beta carbon, which would be the 3rd carbon. Let me think: the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but the 3-position would be the CH2's next carbon. So for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituent (p-tolyl) is on C2, so the configuration is E. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me with E geometry.

Wait, no, maybe the
