Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think... Oh right, a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. 

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, does that look familiar? I think the metric for a pseudosphere might be similar to that of a hyperboloid or something. Oh, wait, another thought: maybe it's related to the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk model uses a metric like (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²) in polar coordinates, where r is the radial coordinate. 

Let me compare that. In the Poincaré disk model, the denominator is (1 - r²)^2, but here the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Oh, maybe because the model's radius is scaled. Oh right, because in the Poincaré model, the disk has radius R, and the metric is (R²)/(R² - r²)^2 times the flat metric. So here, if our denominator is 4 - x² - y², that would correspond to (4 - r²) where r² = x² + y². So 4 is (2)^2. So R is 2 here. 

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm. Wait, the pseudosphere has radius r, but I'm a bit confused about how the radius relates to the model. Oh, in the Poincaré disk model, the radius R of the disk is related to the curvature. The metric I have here must be for a pseudosphere with radius 2. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The curvature K is -1/(R^2), so with R =2, K would be -1/4. 

But the main point is to find the area of the pseudosphere. I recall that the area of a pseudosphere is 4π R², just like a regular sphere. Wait, is that right? Or is it different because of the negative curvature? No, wait, the area formula for a sphere in 3D is 4π R², but a pseudosphere is a surface with infinite extent? Or is it finite? Wait, no, a pseudosphere is an infinitely long surface, right? Like it's a tractricoid or something. So maybe its area is infinite? 

Wait, another approach: let's compute the area using the given metric. The metric is in 2D, so it's a 2-manifold. The area can be computed as the integral over the surface of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is conformally flat, the determinant is just the square of the scale factor. 

So the metric is given in terms of dx² + dy² multiplied by 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the line element ds² = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j, where g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the metric tensor is diagonal.

The area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The determinant det g is (g_xx)(g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy is zero here, det g is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Therefore, the area is the integral over the surface of 32/(4 - r²) dx dy, where r² = x² + y².

But what is the domain of integration? The denominator 4 - r² must be positive to have real values. So 4 - r² >0 → r² <4 → r <2. So the domain of (x,y) is the disk of radius 2 centered at the origin. 

So the area A is the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Switch to polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the radial integral first. Let me factor out the 32 and the θ integral.

A = 32 * ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So A =32 * 2π * ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the integral I = ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So I = ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = (-1/2) ∫ du/u from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) [ ln|u| ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but evaluating from 4 to 0 would be (-1/2) [ ln 0 - ln4 ] → but ln0 is negative infinity. Hmm, but that integral from 0 to 2 would be
