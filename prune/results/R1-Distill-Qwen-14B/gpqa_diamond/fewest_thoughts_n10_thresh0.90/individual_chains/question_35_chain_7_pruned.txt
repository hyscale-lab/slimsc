Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I should probably write this matrix out first.

So, S looks like this:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i  0 ]

Then, A_y is c times S. Since c is h/(4π), I can write A_y as (h/(4π)) multiplied by that matrix. So A_y would be:

[ 0*(h/(4π))  -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0*(h/(4π)) ]

Wait, no, wait. Because when you multiply a matrix by a scalar, each element is multiplied by that scalar. So yeah, that's correct.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Also, we have four options, and I need to pick the correct statement during the calculation.

First, let me think about the eigenvalues of A_y. The eigenvalues a are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

So, let's write down A_y - a I:

[ (0 - a)        ( -i h/(4π) ) ]
[ (i h/(4π) )    (0 - a)      ]

The determinant of this matrix is ( (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i h/(4π) ) (i h/(4π) ) )

Which is a² - [ (i)(-i) (h/(4π))² ) ]

Wait, because ( -i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) = (-i * i) * (h/(4π))². Since i * (-i) is 1 (because i*(-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1). So that term becomes 1 * (h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant equation is:

a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0

Which implies a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, because h/(4π) squared is h²/(16 π²), so square root is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which ones match.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues I found are real numbers, not complex. So the eigenvalues are purely real, no imaginary parts. So any option claiming the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. So A and B can be eliminated because they suggest imaginary parts.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, the total angular momentum J has components J_x, J_y, J_z, and they don't commute. But for eigenfunctions of J^2 and J_z, the expectation values of J_x and J_y are not definite. However, for spin-1/2 particles, like a muon, the intrinsic angular momentum S has components Sx, Sy, Sz. But each of them satisfies S² = (ħ/2)^2 * 3? Wait, no, for spin-1/2, S² is (s(s+1))ħ², where s=1/2. So S² = (3/4 ħ²). So A is proportional to S, so A^2 would be c² times S².

Wait, but if Ay has eigenvalues a = ±h/(4π), then A^2 would have eigenvalues a² = h²/(16 π²). Let's compute A^2: since A = c S, then A^2 = c² S². But S is the Pauli matrices scaled, right? Wait, S is the same as (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices? Wait no, because S is given as:

S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually written as σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So S is σ_y. So S is the Pauli matrix σ_y.

In quantum mechanics, the spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles are S = (ħ/2) σ. So the given S here is σ_y, so S = σ_y. So the actual spin operator would be S = (ħ/2) σ_y, but in this problem, the operator is A_y = c * S, where c is h/(4π). Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is 2π ħ. So h = 2π ħ. So let's substitute c.

c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. Then, since σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, because for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1. So A_y's eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * (±1) → ± ħ/2.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I found the eigenvalues to be ± h/(4π). Let me check that.

Wait, h is 2π ħ, so h/(4π) = (2 π ħ)/(4 π) )= ħ/(2). So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So both ways, same result.

Now, back to the options. So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are out because they talk about imaginary parts.

Now, option C: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Wait, A^2 is (Ay)^2. Since Ay is a Hermitian operator (as it's an angular momentum component), its eigenfunctions form a complete basis, and any eigenstate of Ay will be an eigenstate of A^2 as well because A^2 is a function of Ay. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So the first part of option C is correct.

But what about Az? Az is the z-component of A, which is a different operator. Since [Ay, Az] = iħ (maybe, but I'm not sure about the exact commutator), but in any case, the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az because they don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C says that they can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So that part is correct. So C seems to be a correct statement.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay given. Well, the eigenfunctions form an or
