--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let's dissect it. I think the structure has two cyclohexane rings. One ring is attached to a methyl group which in turn is connected to a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane. Also, there's an aldehyde group somewhere.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached to another carbon). The structure would be cyclohexane with C≡CH attached.

I need to figure out the steps from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about possible reactions and how they can build the structure.

First, maybe I should consider functional group transformations. Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond; perhaps I can do some kind of addition or oxidation. Wait, but how?

The target has an aldehyde group. So maybe I need to oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. But how do I get the alcohol in the first place?

Looking at the options, the reagents involve things like NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, O3, (CH3)2S, and NH4OH.

Option A starts with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, a deprotonating agent. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. Maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. But where?

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. I'm trying to think: ethynylcyclohexane has acidic protons on the alkyne. Deprotonating with a strong base like NaNH2 would give a cyclohexenide. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate it. But wait, where would the methyl go? Maybe at the triple bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is in a position where adding a methyl group would form a cyclohexane ring with a substituent.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option's steps.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: Perhaps adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. H2/Pd: Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. Wait, H2 with Pd would typically hydrogenate a triple bond to a single bond, but sometimes it stops at the alkene. Wait, no, I think H2 and Pd would fully hydrogenate a triple bond to a single bond. So if the alkyne is CH2CH2... Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so it's cyclohexane with a carbon attached to the triple bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the target again. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a methyl group, which is also attached to an OH and another cyclohexane. And an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the target has a structure where there is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and another substituent as a formyl group (CHO). Hmm.

Wait, maybe the target is:

cyclohexane-C(CHO)(CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)) ?

So, two substituents on the cyclohexane: one is an aldehyde (carbaldehyde), and the other is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane.

So the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent that's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group.

Wait, but the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, perhaps:

The main cyclohexane ring has a carbonyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is like:

cyclohexane where one carbon is connected to a CHO (carbaldehyde), and another carbon is connected to a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, I'm not visualizing this correctly. Maybe another approach would help.

Let me think about the starting material and what needs to happen.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane: structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached.

If I can somehow form a ketone or aldehyde from this, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else. Hmm.

Option C: Steps are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think.

Another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group. So perhaps an oxidation reaction is involved. For oxidation of a secondary alcohol to ketone, but we have an aldehyde, which is oxidation of a primary alcohol.

Wait, how to get a primary alcohol from ethynylcyclohexane? Maybe through hydration of the triple bond.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane (C≡CH attached to cyclohexane). If I do a hydration (like acid-catalyzed hydration), that would produce a cis or trans double bond, not a primary alcohol.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait! If I have an alkyne, and I do a hydroboration or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can do a Grignard reaction.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the options.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol. Hmm, so deprotonation with NaNH2 and then quench with methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. So in the presence of an alkyne, it would deprotonate to form a cyclohexenide. Then, adding methanol would perhaps perform an alkylation? Wait, but methanol is a methylating agent. Wait, no, maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, when you have an alkyne treated with NaNH2, you deprotonate to form a strong base, then perhaps quench with an electrophile. So if the reagent after is methanol, perhaps it's an alkylation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: After deprotonating the alkyne, if you add a methyl group, you get a longer chain. For example, if the starting material is CH2-C≡CH, deprotonate to CH-: then add CH3I to get CH2-C≡C-CH2-... Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, could the first step be a deprotonation followed by alkylation to form a new carbon chain, perhaps adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, let me think about each step of each option.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride.

Hmm, same as above, but using ethyl chloride as the methylating agent. Wait, no, ethyl chloride is C2H5Cl, so maybe adding an ethyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about each option's steps.

The target compound has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, so perhaps that comes from an oxidation of a cyclohexanol.

Wait, but how to get the cyclohexanol from ethynylcyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into a carbonyl group through some process.

Wait, another thought: If I have ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps I can perform a hydration (add H2O) to get cyclohexene with a hydroxyl group. Then, further reactions.

Wait, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a reaction to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another possibility: using O3 (ozone) for ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an alkyne could break the triple bond and form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne typically gives an acid or a ketone, depending on substitution.

Wait, let me think. Suppose I have H-C≡C-R (where R is cyclohexane). Ozonolysis would break the triple bond and form two carbonyl groups. But since it's a terminal alkyne, it would produce an aldehyde (since one end is R-C≡C-H, ozonolysis would give R-C=O and HCOOH or something). Wait, no, I think ozonolysis of terminal alkynes gives a carboxylic acid and a carbonyl group. Let me recall: for a triple bond R-C≡C-H, ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like Zn/H2O) would give RCHO (aldehyde) and HCOOH (formic acid). But if the workup is oxidative, like with H2O2, it forms RCOOH and HCOOH.

Wait, but in some cases, ozonolysis can be followed by other reagents. For example, if you use (CH3)2S (dimethyl sulfide) as a reductant, it leads to the formation of aldehydes and ketones without over-oxidizing. So that might be a way.

So, perhaps the plan is:

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane into something else.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group, which could come from the ozonolysis of the alkyne.

But ethynylcyclohexane is a single alkyne. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But in this case, we have a cyclohexane attached to one end, so would that lead to a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde?

Wait, if the alkyne is R-C≡C-H, ozonolysis would give R-CHO and HCOOH. So, in our case, R is cyclohexyl, so the aldehyde would be cyclohexyl-CHO. But the target has cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is attached to the cyclohexane, not a substituent. Hmm, not quite sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, and then ozonolysis is used to create carbonyl groups.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene, which can undergo cycloaddition or other reactions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the options again.

Option C: Steps are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Deprotonate the alkyne to form a strong base, then methyl chloride (a methylating agent) would add a methyl group. So perhaps the alkyne becomes longer.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So, it's cyclohexane attached to a carbon that has a triple bond to another carbon (so cyclohexane-C≡CH). So, the structure is CH2-cyclohexane-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So, it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, ethynyl is a substituent. So, it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached directly.

So, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Step 1: NaNH2 (a strong base) and methyl chloride. So, the alkyne has acidic protons (the H on C≡CH). Deprotonating with NaNH2 gives a cyclohexenide (cyclohexane-C≡C⁻), which then reacts with methyl chloride (CH3Cl), an electrophilic source of CH3+. The base would deprotonate, and the methyl would attack.

Wait, but in the alkyne, after deprotonation, the cyclohexenide would have a negative charge on the carbon. Adding methyl chloride would lead to an alkylation, adding a methyl group to that carbon.

So, after step 1, the structure would be cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So, it's now a propargyl group: CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane? Wait, no. Let me draw it.

Original structure: cyclohexane–C≡CH (ethynylcyclohexane).

After step 1: deprotonation with NaNH2 gives cyclohexane–C≡C⁻, which then reacts with CH3Cl to give cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3.

So now, it's a cyclohexyl propargyl group: cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3.

Step 2: H2 with Pd (probably a catalyst for hydrogenation). So, hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond. But wait, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, but would that require high pressure or specific conditions?

Hydrogenation of a propargyl group (C≡C–CH3) would become CH2–CH2–CH3, but that's not possible because triple bonds hydrogenate to single bonds, but in reality, they'd become CH2–CH2–CH3 via hydrogenation. Wait, no: the propargyl group is CH2–C≡C–CH3. When you hydrogenate that, the triple becomes a single, adding two Hs. So, it would become CH2–CH2–CH3? No, that's not right, because the propargyl group is R–C≡C–R'. Hydrogenation would add Hs across the triple bond, making it a single bond, so R–CH2–CH2–R'.

Wait, so in our case, after step 2, the structure would be cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3. Wait, that's cyclohexane with a butyl group? No, wait, the propargyl is cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3, which is a substituted cyclohexane with a three-carbon chain. So, it's cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3? Or perhaps it's a branch?

Wait, no, I think the structure would be cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3. So, that's a cyclohexane with a three-carbon chain, but that's a bit odd.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to get me closer to the target. The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, so maybe I'm missing something.

Hmm, perhaps after hydrogenation, another step is needed. Let's look at step 3 in option C: O3/(CH3)2S. That's ozone followed by (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but after step 2, we have a single bond—so no double bond. So, why would step 3 be ozonolysis? That doesn't make sense. Unless step 2 didn't fully hydrogenate the bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, making a double bond. So, if step 2 is H2 and Pd-calcium carbonate, perhaps that's a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene.

Wait, but H2 with Pd usually fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are such that it stops at the alkene. But I'm not sure. Pd is typically used for catalytic hydrogenation. If a triple bond is present, it might require more vigorous conditions to hydrogenate all the way to a single bond.

Wait, maybe in step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond. So, after step 1, we have a propargyl group (C≡C–CH3), which in step 2 is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, so cyclohexane–CH2–C=CH2.

Wait, no, let me correct: the structure after step 1 is cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3. So, hydrogenation would reduce the triple bond to a double bond (if partial) or a single bond (if full). If it's a partial hydrogenation, we get cyclohexane–CH2–C=CH2? No, perhaps cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about each option's possible outcome.

Option C: After step 2, the hydrogenation of the propargyl group would give a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3. But then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Wait, but if there's no double bond, how would ozonolysis proceed?

That doesn't make sense. So maybe option C isn't the right path.

Let me consider option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol

2. Li / liquid NH3

3. O3/(CH3)2S

4. NH4OH

Hmm. So step 1: NaNH2 and methanol.

NaNH2 is a strong base; when reacted with an alkyne, it deprotonates to form a strong base. Then, if methanol is added, perhaps it's a quenching step. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to form an alkyne with a new substituent.

Wait, I think when you have an alkyne treated with NaNH2, you deprotonate to form a lithium or sodium salt. Then, adding an electrophile like CH3I would perform an alkylation. But in this case, the second reagent is methanol. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, and then quenched with methanol, leading to an alkoxy group? Or maybe a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some process. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 in step 1 is used for deprotonation, and methanol is the solvent or a source of a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps this is a method to form a Grignard reagent, but that's usually done with Mg and ether. Here, NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps used for deprotonation, and then quenching with something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the target again.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group, and another substituent which is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol or something that can be oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: perhaps ozonolysis is used to cleave a double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, if we can form a double bond, ozonolysis could give the desired aldehyde.

But how to form a double bond from ethynylcyclohexane? Maybe via hydrogenation of the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me outline a possible synthesis pathway.

1. Take ethynylcyclohexane and hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond, giving cyclohexene with a substituent.

Wait, but how? Hydrogenation of the alkyne would require a catalyst. Using H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's (which gives cis addition) or a poisoned catalyst. Alternatively, using a different method.

Wait, but hydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkene is possible, but requires specific conditions. For example, using H2 with a poisoned catalyst like quinoline (for cis addition) or using a different method like catalytic hydrogenation with a specific catalyst.

But looking at the options, some steps involve H2 with Pd or other metals.

So, for example, perhaps step 2 in some options is the hydrogenation of the triple bond to a double bond.

Wait, but in option B, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a Birch reduction condition, which is for aromatic rings, perhaps. So maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, step 2 in option C is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate. So that's likely a hydrogenation catalyst. So maybe step 2 is hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, but that doesn't directly help.

Wait, perhaps the overall plan is:

- Convert the alkyne into a carbonyl via ozonolysis.

But to get the target, which has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and another substituent.

Wait, let me think. If I have ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane–C≡CH), and I perform ozonolysis, what do I get?

Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (R–C≡CH) typically gives R–CHO and HCOOH (formic acid). So, in this case, R is cyclohexyl, so ozonolysis would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formic acid.

Wait, so if I can perform ozonolysis on the alkyne, I would directly get cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. But the target is more complex, with another substituent.

Hmm, perhaps the target is formed by adding a substituent to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, the target has a substituent that's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, that's a branch on the cyclohexane that includes another cyclohexane ring.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves first forming the aldehyde via ozonolysis, then adding the substituent.

But how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent comes from a Grignard reaction. So, if I form a ketone from the alkyne via some steps, then perform a Grignard addition.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is introduced via a cross-coupling reaction.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the options again and see if any make sense.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making it longer.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but after hydrogenation, there's no double bond. So this step might not do anything.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So option C can't be right.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonate the alkyne and then perform some alkylation with methanol, but I'm not sure.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → Birch reduction conditions, which typically reduce aromatic rings, but we're dealing with alkenes or alkynes. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the steps required to form the target.

The target has a -CHO group, so that must come from oxidation. The aldehyde is a primary carbonyl group. So, perhaps an oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But how to get a primary alcohol from ethynylcyclohexane?

Another thought: perhaps the alkyne can be converted into a primary alcohol via a series of reactions.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then through some steps to a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexanol derivative, which is then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think of the steps in each option.

Option B:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → add ethyl group.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → possibly a Birch reduction, but for alkyne?

3. O3 and H2O → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Hmm. Step 1: alkyne becomes longer with ethyl group.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, maybe for deprotonation, or for elimination.

Step 3: ozonolysis, so need a double bond.

So, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is converted into a longer chain, and then step 2 converts it into a diene.

Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation and ethylation, leading to a longer chain. Then, step 2 is elimination to form a double bond. Then, ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyls.

But I'm not confident.

Option D:

After step 1, NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe the alkyne is deprotonated and then quenched with methanol, leading to an alkoxy group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe this is a method to form a ketone. Wait, I'm not familiar with that specific reaction.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenate it, then perform ozonolysis.

Wait, let's think: If I add a methyl group to the alkyne, making it a longer chain, then hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, then perhaps form a double bond elsewhere, then ozonolyze to form aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe after hydrogenation, the molecule has a butyl group or similar, and ozonolysis would break it into aldehyde groups.

But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another angle: the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So, perhaps the starting material's alkyne is converted into that aldehyde via ozonolysis. But I'm not seeing the intermediates.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But how to get the diol from the alkyne?

Wait, the hydroboration of an alkyne can give a diol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced to a cis or trans diol via some dihydroxylation method.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, but that would require specific catalysts. I think acid-catalyzed hydration of terminal alkynes gives cis alkenes, not ketones.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option D's steps: NaNH2, methanol; Li/liquid NH3; O3, (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is deprotonation and alkylation, but with methanol, perhaps forming an ether.

Wait, but NaNH2 and methanol would probably lead to the formation of a metal amide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonating the alkyne, then adding a methyl group from methanol. But that would require some kind of alkylation, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a method to form a cyclohexanol group, which can then be oxidized.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the target's structure again.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) and another substituent as CHO (aldehyde).

So, the main ring is cyclohexane, with two substituents: one is -CHO, the other is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is used to form a longer chain, which is then cyclized.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe it's time to consider which option's steps can lead to the target.

Looking at option C:

After step 1: cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3

Step 2: H2/Pd → becomes cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens.

So that can't be right.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe forms a cyclohexenide, which is then quenched with methanol to form an O-methyl group?

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonation and alkylation, but I'm not certain.

Option B:

Step1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → cyclohexane–C≡C–CH2CH3

Step2: Li/NH3 → Birch reduction, but for what?

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, but the molecule isn't halogenated.

Wait, Li in NH3 is typically used for Birch reductions (aromatic rings), but maybe for elimination in aliphatic compounds.

Wait, step 3 is O3 and H2O → ozonolysis.

So, if after step 1 and 2, there's a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls.

So, let's see:

Step1: ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexane–C≡C–CH2CH3 (after alkylation with ethyl chloride).

Step2: Li/NH3 → perhaps deprotonation and elimination, forming a double bond. So, the structure would be cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH2CH2? No, perhaps elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, if after step 1, the structure is cyclohexane–C≡C–CH2CH3, then step 2 would eliminate a molecule to form a double bond.

Wait, but Li in NH3 is a strong base; perhaps it abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, from cyclohexane–C≡C–CH2CH3, perhaps the Li would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but alkyne elimination with a strong base would typically form a triple bond again. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is to first add a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenate it to form a longer chain, then ozonolyze to form aldehydes.

Alternatively, the correct steps involve using NaNH2 to deprotonate the alkyne, then methyl chloride to add a methyl group, then hydrogenate the triple bond, then ozonolysis.

Wait, but that's option C, and I thought that step 3 wouldn't work because there's no double bond.

Wait, unless after step 2, the molecule has a double bond.

Wait, maybe in step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, not a single bond. Because if you use H2 with Pd but in a way that stops at the alkene, perhaps via controlled hydrogenation.

In that case, the structure after step 2 would be cyclohexane–CH2–C=CH2.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis (O3, (CH3)2S). Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So, cyclohexane–CH2–C=CH2 → ozonolysis → cyclohexane–CHO and formaldehyde.

But the target has only one aldehyde group. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the other part forms something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis leads to a diketone or another structure.

Wait, in any case, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about which reagents are used for which reactions.

NaNH2 is often used for deprotonation of alkynes to form strong bases, which can then be alkylated. H2 with Pd is for hydrogenation. O3 is for ozonolysis.

The target has an aldehyde group, which suggests a carbonyl group from a cleavage reaction, likely ozonolysis.

Putting it all together:

The alkyne is first alkylated to add a substituent, then hydrogenated to form a double bond, then ozonolysed to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the correct sequence is to add a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, then perform ozonolysis to form the aldehyde.

So, which option includes these steps?

Looking at the options, option C has steps 1,2,3 as adding methyl, hydrogenating, then ozonolysis.

So, the steps would be:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2, CH3Cl → cyclohexane–C≡C–CH3.

2. H2, Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to double bond → cyclohexane–CH2–CH2–CH3? No, wait, maybe it's cyclohexane–CH2–C=CH2.

No, wait, the hydrogenation of a triple bond (C≡C) to a double bond (C=C) would require partial hydrogenation.

Assuming that's the case, after step 2, we have a double bond. Then step 3, ozonolysis, would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So, after ozonolysis, we would get two carbonyl groups from the double bond. The molecule would split into two parts.

But wait, that would give us two aldehydes, which doesn't align with the target structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation doesn't go all the way, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm stuck again.

I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options and the target.

The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via ozonolysis. So, the correct steps would involve ozonolysis.

Looking at the options, the steps involving ozonolysis are options B, C, D.

Option B: step3 is O3/H2O, step4 NH4OH. Option C: step3 O3 with (CH3)2S, step4 Ba(OH)2. Option D: step3 O3 with (CH3)2S, step4 NH4OH.

Hmm. So, after ozonolysis, the workup is either H2O (option B), (CH3)2S (options C and D), or NH4OH (option D).

The choice of workup affects whether the carbonyl groups are formed as acids or aldehydes/ketones.

In particular, reductive workup (like (CH3)2S) tends to give aldehydes and ketones, while oxidative workup (like H2O2) gives carboxylic acids and ketones.

So, in option C, after ozonolysis, the workup is (CH3)2S, which would give aldehydes.

So, if the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated to a double bond, then ozonolyzed with reductive workup, perhaps giving the aldehyde.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are in option D: adding a methyl group, then performing a Birch reduction to form a diol, then ozonolysis.

I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should think about the correct reagent sequence for forming the target.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached. So, perhaps the substituent comes from a methyl group added via alkylation.

In the target, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, perhaps a Grignard reaction is involved where a cyclohexyl group is added.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed by a cross-coupling reaction.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options, the correct sequence likely involves adding a methyl group, hydrogenating, then ozonolysis.

So, looking at option C, which has these steps. But earlier I thought that after step 2, the molecule would have a single bond, making ozonolysis ineffective.

But perhaps I'm wrong, and step 2 only partially hydrogenates the triple bond to a double bond.

In that case, ozonolysis would work.

So, after step 2, we have a double bond, step3 ozonolysis would split it into two carbonyls, and step4 would be Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base for elimination or perhaps for saponification.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step4 in option C is a way to dehydrate or form an alcohol.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, it's used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. Or in elimination reactions.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, the molecule has carbonyl groups which are then subjected to Ba(OH)2 for further reaction.

But I'm not sure.

I'm running out of time, so I'll make an educated guess. I think the correct option is C.


The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent containing a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane and an aldehyde group. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with a terminal alkyne group (-C≡CH). The synthesis involves functional group transformations to introduce the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl substituents.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming a propargyl group.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in a longer alkyl chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for elimination or oxidation, but this step does not align with forming the aldehyde group.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxidation, but the sequence does not lead to the desired product.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with an ethyl group, forming a longer chain.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Birch reduction conditions, typically for aromatic systems, but unclear how this step contributes to the target.
3. **O₃/ H₂O**: Ozonolysis could cleave a double bond, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the aldehyde group.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup after ozonolysis, but the earlier steps do not set up the correct intermediates.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group, forming a propargyl group.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Partially hydrogenates the triple bond to a double bond, creating a conjugated system.
3. **O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups. The reductive workup with (CH₃)₂S ensures the formation of aldehydes.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for further oxidation or elimination, completing the formation of the hydroxymethyl group.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne, but the role of methanol is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Birch reduction conditions, which are not relevant for the alkyne.
3. **O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis could cleave a double bond, but the earlier steps do not set up the correct intermediates.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup after ozonolysis, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence. The alkyne is first alkylated, then partially hydrogenated to a double bond, which is subsequently cleaved by ozonolysis to form aldehyde groups. The final step with Ba(OH)₂ likely completes the formation of the hydroxymethyl group. This sequence aligns with the functional transformations needed to synthesize the target molecule.
