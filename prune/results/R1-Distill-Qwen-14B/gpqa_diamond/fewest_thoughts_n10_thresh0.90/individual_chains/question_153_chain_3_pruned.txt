Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving Michael additions. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. Wait, Michael addition typically involves a nucleophilic enolate attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it should form the enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH. The enolate would form at the central carbon, making the alpha position negative. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, more accurately, it's CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 connected to a p-tolyl group on the other end. Wait, no, wait. The formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituents. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Or no, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH2-p-tolyl? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, the correct structure for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)O-R, where R is p-tolyl. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(O)CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The
