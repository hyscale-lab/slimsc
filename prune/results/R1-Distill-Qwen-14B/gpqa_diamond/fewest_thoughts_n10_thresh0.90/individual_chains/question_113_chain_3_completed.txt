--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygen counts.

First, I'll try to break down each piece of data given.

The FTIR has a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR often indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could also be from an -OH stretch, perhaps in an alcohol or maybe a phenol? Or maybe a carbonyl group with some hydrogen bonding, but I'm not sure.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are both in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a ketone, maybe an ester or aldehyde. 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide, but amides are usually lower. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Wait, but why two carbonyl peaks? Could it be two different carbonyl groups or perhaps one group with two distinct types of C=O? Hmm, maybe a conjugated system. For example, an ester and a ketone nearby? Or maybe a cyclic structure. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an aromatic ring causing some shift in the carbonyl.

Moving on to the 1H NMR: several peaks including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to =CH2 groups or the protons adjacent to a double bond. So the compound must have a double bond—maybe an alkene or maybe part of a ring like in a cyclohexene or something else.

Finally, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I'm a bit rusty on mass spec, but m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 12 + 16 + 3*1 +16 = 12+3*2 +16*2? Wait, no, (CH3)2O is (2*15) +16 = 30 +16=46? Wait, maybe I should calculate. 2*(12+3) +16 = 2*15=30 +16=46. Hmm, so 45 isn't that. Alternatively, maybe it's C3H7O or other fragments.

Wait, 45 is also the molecular ion for a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, if the molecule breaks into a part like (CH2)2O, but wait, that would be more like 44 (if it's (CH2O) something else. Wait, maybe a methyl group attached to something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group. For example, a ketone fragment. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 could be the result of a cleavage. Let me think: 45 is 12 + 3*1 + 16*1 = 12+3+16=31? No, that doesn't add up. Wait, 45 is 12*(3) + 1*(9) + 16*(0)? Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Let me calculate 45 as the sum of elements. 45 could be CH3COO- but that's weight 60. Or maybe it's (CH3)CO, which is 58? No, wait, 45 is 12*3 + 1*9, which is 3 carbons and 9 hydrogens. That would be C3H9, but that's a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment like CH2O (formaldehyde), which is 30, but 45 is higher.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So the molecular weight would be 6*12 + H count + O count.

For each option:

A) C6H12O: 6*12=72 +12=84 +16=100. So M is 100.

B) C6H10O: 72 +10=82 +16=98. M=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72+10=82 +32=114. M=114.

D) C6H12O2:72+12=84 +32=116. M=116.

So the molecular ion would be around these values. But the mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So the fragment is 45. So which options would have a fragment of 45 as part of their possible breakdown?

Looking at each option:

Option C: M=114. 114-45=69, which doesn't immediately ring a bell, but maybe a CH2CH2O group or something else. Or perhaps the 45 is part of a larger structure.

Option A: M=100. 100-45=55. Hmm, not sure.

Option B: M=98. 98-45=53. Not sure.

Option D: M=116. 116-45=71. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a common one. Let me think about common molecular ions. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3CH2COOH (but that's 60). Wait, no. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of a fragment. Oh, wait, maybe it's the loss of something. For example, in an ester, maybe the ester group breaks off.

Wait, another thought. The peak at 45 could be due to the loss of a methyl group (15) and some other part. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O, which is 44. Close but not 45. Alternatively, perhaps a propionyl group, but that's 58? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a cleavage. For example, in a molecule with an ester group, the ester could split into an acid and an alcohol. But I'm not sure how that would give 45.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the possible functional groups.

The FTIR has two carbonyl peaks, which might suggest two different carbonyl groups. Alternatively, conjugation between groups. For instance, an alpha-beta unsaturated ester might have a carbonyl around 1700 and another peak due to conjugation, maybe a C=C peak around 1650. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an ester.

Wait, but the 1650 could also be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. But in that case, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or ketone.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So there must be a double bond. So maybe an enone structure, which is a conjugated ketone and double bond. That would fit the two carbonyl peaks and the vinyl hydrogens.

So, the compound might be something like cyclohexenone or an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

If it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, then the structure would have a conjugated ester and double bond. The IR would show a strong peak for the ester carbonyl (around 1700) and the conjugated double bond (maybe around 1650). The vinyl protons would be in the NMR.

Now, what about the molecular formula? Let's see.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight 116.

B) C6H10O: molecular weight 98.

C) C6H10O2: molecular weight 114.

D) C6H12O: molecular weight 100.

If it's an ester, the formula would have two oxygen atoms. So the formula would be either A or C or D.

Wait, an ester has the formula R-O-CO-R', which would require at least two oxygen atoms. So options A and C.

So, between A and C.

The IR data: broad peak at 3000 cm-1, which would indicate an -OH group. But wait, an ester doesn't have an -OH; it's an OR group. So maybe the broad peak is from an alcohol or a phenol. Hmm, but if it's an ester, perhaps there's another -OH group present? Or maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from the O-H in a carboxylic acid, but then the ester would come from that, but that might not fit.

Wait, let's think again. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is usually O-H stretch. So the compound likely has an -OH group. But if it's an ester, maybe not. So perhaps the compound is a diol ester or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But a lactone would have an ester group but also a ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester, which would have two carbonyl groups.

Wait, another thought: the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 could be from an alcohol -OH. So the compound might be a diol ester or an ester with an alcohol group.

Wait, but if the compound is an ester and an alcohol, the formula would have more O's. Let's see the formulas again.

Option A is C6H12O2: two oxygens. If the compound is an ester (which has two oxygens) and an alcohol (-OH, which doesn't add more O), so that's possible.

Option C is C6H10O2: two oxygens. So the compound could be an ester without an -OH group, but then why the broad peak at 3000? Hmm, maybe the ester's O isn't from an -OH, but perhaps another source. Alternatively, maybe the O is from a ketone and an ester.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

If the compound has two carbonyl groups and an -OH group, then the formula would have three oxygens. But looking at the options, none of them have three O's. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the broad peak is not an -OH. Wait, other possibilities for a broad peak around 3000: maybe an amine N-H stretch, but the options don't have N, so that's probably not it. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic C-H stretch, but those are usually around 3000-3100 and not as broad. A broad peak is more indicative of O-H.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an acid. Like a carboxylic acid. But then the IR would have a very broad peak around 2500-3300 for the O-H, which aligns with the 3000 given. But in this case, the carbonyl would be around 1700, perhaps a bit lower. Also, the NMR would have an acidic proton which might be a broad peak as well.

But the NMR says they observed peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond.

Wait, putting this together: the compound has a carboxylic acid group (broad O-H), a carbonyl (from the 1700 peak), and a double bond (vinyl H's). But the formula options don't have any with three oxygens except if I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again. The IR has peaks at 1700 and 1650. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700. The 1650 peak could be a conjugated double bond, perhaps from an enoic acid.

But the molecular formula for a carboxylic acid with a double bond would require more carbons. For a six-carbon acid, perhaps something like hex-3-enoic acid. The formula would be C6H10O2. Oh, wait, option C is C6H10O2. So that would fit. Let me check.

Hex-3-enoic acid would be CH2CH2CH=CHCH2COOH. The formula would be C6H10O2. So the molecular formula would be option C.

But wait, the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which has a molecular weight of 114, a fragment at 45 would be a significant part of the molecule.

Another way to look at it: what could be a fragment of 45 in a C6H10O2 molecule?

45 is 12*3 + 1*9, which is C3H9. So maybe a propyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment with a carbonyl group. Wait, 45 could be a ketone like acetone? Acetone is (propan-2-one), which has a formula of C3H6O. Mw is (3*12) + (6*1) + (16) = 36 +6 +16=58. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment comes from the loss of a larger group. For example, in a molecule like ester, the ester group could cleave, leaving a fragment. Let's think about an ester: RCOOR'. If the ester breaks, the RCOO- would have a molecular weight higher than 45, but perhaps the R' part could be a fragment with 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a (CH2)2O group, but that's 44. Wait, what about a CH3COO- group? No, that's 60.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider the possible structures and see which one would give a fragment of 45.

If the compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, like methyl acrylate (but that's four carbons). Wait, but the formula is C6H10O2. So maybe it's something like a substituted acrylic ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, a lactone, which would have a ring structure. But I'm not sure how that would break down into a 45 fragment.

Another approach: considering the degrees of unsaturation. The formula for each option:

For option A, C6H12O2: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, DoU=(2*6 + 2 -12 -0 +0)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

But the NMR has vinyl protons, which are from a double bond, so DoU must be at least one.

Option B: C6H10O: DoU=(2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds, or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2: DoU=(2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O: DoU=(2*6+2 -12)/2=(14-12)/2=1.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond, so DoU should be at least one. So all options except B and C have DoU 2? Wait no, option B has DoU 2, which would be one double bond or two rings or one double bond and a ring. Option C also has DoU 2.

But the problem says the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and an -OH group. Let's see.

If the compound is a beta-keto alcohol, then the structure would have a ketone (carbonyl) and an -OH group. But the IR would show a strong peak around 1700 for the ketone and maybe a peak around 3300 for the -OH. But the given IR has a peak at 3000, which is a bit lower than typical. Alternatively, perhaps it's an enol, which might have a conjugated system.

Wait, but the IR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Maybe the 1700 is a ketone and the 1650 is a conjugated C=C.

Putting this all together, maybe the structure is a cyclic ketone with a double bond or an enone structure. But then where does the O-H come in?

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a diester, but that would have more oxygen and probably not fit the options.

Alternatively, it's a glycolic acid derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45 could be a common group. Let me think of possible fragments:

- For a compound with an ester group, the ester might cleave to form an acid and an alcohol. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', then the RCOO- part would have a molecular weight of RCOO (which depends on R). If R is methyl (COOCH3, which is 60), but that's not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is an ethyl group or something else. Or perhaps the fragment is from the breaking of a six-membered ring into a three-membered one, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. For example, acetone has a molecular weight of 58, which is higher than 45. Hmm.

Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of methyl acetate. Let's compute: CH3COOCH3. Molecular formula is C3H6O2. Molecular weight is (3*12)+(6*1)+(2*16)=36+6+32=74. So no, that's higher than 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a CH3CO group (which is 43), but that's not 45. Or maybe a CH2CO group, which is 44, but not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment with a carbonyl and a CH3 group. Like (CH3)CO, which is 44, but again not 45.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the molecular formulas again.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: M=116.

B) C6H10O: M=98.

C) C6H10O2: M=114.

D) C6H12O: M=100.

If the molecular ion is 114 (option C), and the fragment is 45, then 114-45=69. 69 could be another fragment, perhaps a CH2CH2CH2COOH group or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, the 45 could be the molecular ion of a fragment, like a propyl group. But I'm not making progress here.

Let me try to think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So the structure must have a double bond, probably conjugated with a carbonyl group, as that would explain the two carbonyl peaks in IR.

So, perhaps the structure is something like a cinnamic acid derivative. Cinnamic acid has the structure CH2=CH-C6H4-COOH, but that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, it's a smaller molecule.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is a beta-keto ester. For example, ethyl acetoacetate. Its formula is C5H8O3, but that's not matching any of the options. The options have C6.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond, like a lactone with a double bond.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to summarize the data again.

FTIR: Broad peak at ~3000 (O-H), strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (two carbonyls or conjugated groups).

1H NMR: Peaks include vinyl Hs (so a double bond).

Mass Spec: fragment at m/z=45.

The options are four formulas, all with six carbons. 

The presence of two carbonyl peaks in IR suggests either two different carbonyl groups or one group with two peaks due to conjugation.

The broad peak at 3000 suggests an -OH group.

So, the compound must have both a carbonyl group and an -OH group. So, perhaps it's a beta-keto alcohol, or a substituted phenol with a carbonyl.

Wait, if it's a phenol derivative, the IR would show a broad peak for the O-H. The presence of a carbonyl near 1700 would fit a ketone in the ring, perhaps.

But phenol's O-H is usually broader and around 3300. The given peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower but could still be O-H.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted phenol with a carbonyl group, like a phenol ester. But then the formula would have more oxygen.

Wait, but the options don't have three oxygen atoms. So, perhaps the compound is a diester with an -OH group.

Hmm, another approach: the molecular formula with two oxygen atoms. So options A, C, and D have two or more.

Wait, option A is C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation is 1. So it could have a ring or a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So either two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond.

The presence of vinyl hydrogens (double bond) and two carbonyl peaks suggests DoU is at least 2, so option C would fit.

So, the structure has two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Wait, but what structure would have two carbonyl groups and an O-H group?

Perhaps a cyclic diketone with an -OH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal. But that's more about sugars, which might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxy ketone, but that's just speculation.

Hmm, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto acid. For example, something like CH2(CO2H)CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, a six-carbon beta-keto acid would have the structure RC(O)CH2COOH. Let's see: formula would be C6H10O3, but none of the options have three O's.

Wait, maybe it's a methyl acrylate derivative, but that's perhaps getting too specific.

Another thought: The IR peak at 1650 could be from an aromatic ring, but then the compound would have a benzene ring. If it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like in acetophenone, but that has only one carbonyl. Alternatively, something like phenyl acetate, which has an ester group. But then the IR would have a peak for the ester carbonyl (about 1700) and perhaps another peak from the aromatic ring's C=C, which is around 1600-1450. But the given peak is at 1650, which is a bit higher than typical for benzene. So maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, if the compound has an aromatic ring and a conjugated carbonyl (like in benzaldehyde), the IR would show peaks at around 1700 and 1650. The NMR would have aromatic protons and possibly vinyl protons if there's a double bond elsewhere.

But then the formula would have multiple rings, which would affect the DoU.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an enol ester, which has a conjugated double bond and an ester group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But I'm not sure about the formula. Let me compute: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2. Yes, that's formula option C.

So, the structure would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The IR would show the ester carbonyl (around 1700) and the conjugated double bond (maybe around 1650). The NMR would have vinyl protons (from the double bond) and ester protons if any are present.

But wait, the IR also has a broad peak at 3000, which would be O-H. But in an ester, there's no O-H. So perhaps that's another group. Unless the compound has both an ester and an -OH group, like a diol ester. But that would require more oxygen.

Wait, that can't be because the options don't have three oxygens. So maybe the broad peak isn't an O-H. Alternatively, perhaps it's an N-H stretch, but the options don't have N.

Hmm, perhaps the broad peak is from an alcohol (-OH), but then the formula must have at least one O for that. Looking at the options, all have multiple O's except option B.

Wait, option B is C6H10O. So, one oxygen. So, maybe it's a ketone with an alcohol group. But that would have two O's. Hmmm.

Wait, no. If the formula is C6H10O, that's one O. So, the only group possible is an alcohol. So, a compound with an -OH and a carbonyl group. But that would require two O's, because the carbonyl is an O. So the formula would be C6H10O2. So option C.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think: if the compound has an -OH group and a carbonyl, that's two oxygen atoms. So molecular formula would be C6H10O2 (option C), which matches the DoU of 2.

That makes sense. So the structure could be something like cyclohexenone with an -OH group, but that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal, but that's more about sugars.

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR has vinyl H. So, the structure has a double bond. The IR has two carbonyl peaks, which could be a conjugated carbonyl and another group. The broad peak at 3000 would be from an -OH group.

So, the structure must have a carbonyl group (maybe a ketone), a double bond, and an -OH group.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like 3-hydroxy-2-pentenone. The formula would be C5H8O2, but the options are for C6.

Alternatively, maybe a six-membered ring with a conjugated carbonyl and an -OH group.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexenone derivative with an -OH group. Then the formula would be C6H10O2.

So, the structure would have a cyclohexene ring (double bond), a ketone (carbonyl), and an -OH. That would explain the two carbonyl peaks (the ketone at 1700 and perhaps the conjugated double bond at 1650). The -OH would give the broad peak at 3000.

But in that case, the molecular formula would indeed be C6H10O2 (option C), which has two oxygens.

So, the molecular formula would be option C.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum: the fragment at 45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular ion is 114. So, 114-45=69. 69 is a possible fragment. For example, if the molecule loses a fragment with 45 (m/z=45), the remaining would be 69. What's 69? Maybe a C4H7O group? Let me calculate: 4*12=48 +7=55 +16=71. Not 69. Alternatively, perhaps it's a C3H5O2 group: 3*12=36 +5=41 +32=109. No.

Hmm, perhaps the 45 fragment comes from a part of the molecule. Let's say the molecule is something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking for the most common fragment at 45. I'll try to think of what has a mass of 45.

45 is the molecular weight of:

- C3H7O: 3*12=36 +7=35 +16=54 → nope.

- C2H5COOH (but that's 60). Hmm.

Wait, 45 can be (CH2O) but that's formaldehyde, 30. Hmm. Alternatively, it's a fragment involving the loss of a larger group.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene group (O=C=O), but that's more like 64. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3CO group, which is 44. Close, but not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CHCOO^− group. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for common fragments that have a mass of 45.

Wait, another thought: The m/z=45 could be a fragment of a benzene ring. But I don't think that's the case because the molecular formula doesn't have benzene (six carbons, but perhaps not).

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is a tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91, so no.

Wait, perhaps the 45 is the fragment from a ketone cleavage. For example, if there's a ketone in the molecule, it might break into two parts. If the ketone is at a certain position, perhaps one fragment is 45.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is an ester with a fragment that breaks off as 45.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me go back to the options.

Option C is the formula that has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation, which fits with the IR and NMR data. So I think the correct answer is C) C6H10O2.


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm$^-$, indicating the presence of an -OH group. Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm$^-$ suggest the presence of two carbonyl groups, possibly due to conjugation or different functional groups. The $^1$H NMR spectrum includes peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a double bond. The Mass Spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$**  
   - Molecular weight = 116.  
   - Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1.  
   - This formula does not account for the two carbonyl peaks observed in the IR spectrum, as it would require at least two degrees of unsaturation.  

2. **Option B: C$_6$H$_{10}$O**  
   - Molecular weight = 98.  
   - DoU = 2.  
   - This formula has only one oxygen atom, which cannot explain the broad peak at 3000 cm$^-$ (indicating an -OH group) and the two carbonyl peaks.  

3. **Option C: C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**  
   - Molecular weight = 114.  
   - DoU = 2.  
   - This formula fits the data well:  
     - The two oxygen atoms account for the -OH group (broad peak at 3000 cm$^-$) and the two carbonyl groups (peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm$^-$).  
     - The two degrees of unsaturation align with the presence of a double bond (vinyl hydrogens in NMR) and a carbonyl group.  
     - The fragment peak at m/z = 45 can be explained by the breakdown of the molecule, consistent with this formula.  

4. **Option D: C$_6$H$_{12}$O**  
   - Molecular weight = 100.  
   - DoU = 1.  
   - This formula has only one oxygen atom, which cannot explain the broad peak at 3000 cm$^-$ or the two carbonyl peaks.  

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two oxygen atoms to account for the -OH group and the two carbonyl groups. The degrees of unsaturation (DoU = 2) match the presence of a double bond and a carbonyl group. The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is consistent with the breakdown of the molecule. Therefore, the correct molecular formula is **C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**.
