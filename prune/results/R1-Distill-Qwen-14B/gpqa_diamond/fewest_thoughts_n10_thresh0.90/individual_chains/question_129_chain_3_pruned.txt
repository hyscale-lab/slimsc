Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can be tricky. Let's see what I can do. So the question is about identifying Compound E based on a series of reactions starting from Compound A. There are some hints and options given, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me read the question again carefully. The reaction scheme is:

Compound A → HCN → Compound B
Compound B → H2/Pd → Compound C
Compound C → HNO2 → Compound D
Compound D → elimination of inert gas → Compound E

And there are two hints. Hint a says that when Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. So I think I should figure out what kind of reaction that is. Oh yeah, the ylide reaction usually refers to the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde or ketone with a ylide.

So if Compound A reacts with a ylide to form that compound, that suggests that Compound A was a carbonyl compound, probably a ketone. Because the Wittig reaction is with aldehydes or ketones, right? So the product would be an alkene. Let me look at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is like a substituent on the cyclopentane. So the substituent is a propenyl group perhaps? Or maybe the ylide part adds a new substituent.

Wait, the product is a substituted cyclopentane with a propenyl group attached. So the Wittig reaction would have added a new double bond. So Compound A must have been a ketone that's part of a cyclopentane structure. Because when the ylide reacts with it, it would replace the carbonyl group (O) with a CH2 group and form a double bond elsewhere.

Looking at the structure of the product: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)=. So when the Wittig reaction occurs, the carbonyl (C=O) becomes CH2 group, and the ylide brings in the new substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the Wittig adds a new substituent with a double bond. Let me think: the starting ketone (Compound A) would be something like cyclopentanone with substituents. But I'm not exactly sure yet, maybe I'll come back to this.

Now, looking at the second hint: the IR spectrum of Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. The IR of Compound E is around 1715 cm^-1, which is also a carbonyl but maybe a different type. Wait, 1750 is higher than 1715. Usually, ketones are around 1715, esters a bit higher, maybe around 1740. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think: ketones typically have peaks around 1715 cm^-1, aldehydes maybe a little higher, around 1720 or 1740 depending on the substitution. So if Compound A has a peak at 1750, that suggests maybe an ester or perhaps an aldehyde. But wait, the product of the Wittig is an alkene, so if Compound A is a ketone, then the peak is around 1715, but in this case, it's 1750, which is higher. So maybe it's an aldehyde? Because aldehydes have higher wavenumber for the carbonyl?

Wait, another possibility: if the carbonyl is more electron-withdrawing, perhaps it's an ester or maybe a more substituted ketone? Wait, no, more substituted ketones have lower frequencies. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ketone? No, that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think: Aldehydes have higher carbonyl stretching frequencies than ketones. So a peak at 1750 is more like an aldehyde. But if Compound A is a ketone, then perhaps it's a cyclic ketone, which might have a slightly higher frequency. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. But the question says in hint a that it's reacting via a Wittig, implying it's a carbonyl compound.

So perhaps Compound A is a cyclic ketone, and the peak is around 1750 because of ring strain or something. Hmm. I'll put that thought aside for now and look at the reaction steps.

The first step: Compound A reacts with HCN to form Compound B. HCN is a nucleophile. Typically, when a carbonyl reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So if Compound A is a ketone, Compound B would be a cyanohydrin. So the reaction would add a CN group and an OH group to the same carbon. Wait, but wait, HCN is a weak acid and a nucleophile. The mechanism would be nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, leading to a cyanohydrin.

So, for example, if Compound A is cyclopentanone, Compound B would be cyclopentane cyanohydrin—so a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached to the same carbon.

Next step: Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd. That's hydrogenation, so the reduction of what? Well, in Compound B, after the cyanohydrin formation, there are two new groups: OH and CN attached to the same carbon. But wait, HCN adds across the carbonyl, so the product would have an alcohol and a cyanide group on the same carbon. Wait, no, let me think: in the cyanohydrin, the carbonyl (C=O) becomes a CH(OH)CN group. So the structure would have a CH(OH)CN attached.

Wait, no, wait: the carbonyl (R2C=O) reacts with HCN to form R2C(OH)CN. So the carbon that was the carbonyl now has an OH and a CN group. So in the cyanohydrin, that carbon is now a CH(OH)CN group.

Then, when Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Which parts can be hydrogenated here? The CN group is a nitrile. Hydrogenation of nitriles typically requires higher pressure or different catalysts. Wait, with H2 and Pd, perhaps the double bonds are hydrogenated, but in this case, there are no double bonds in Compound B. Wait, unless maybe the cyanohydrin leads to some sort of double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me double-check: when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the product is a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached to the same carbon. Then, when hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) is reduced. Because under hydrogenation with a catalyst like Pd, nitriles can be reduced. Let me think: the reduction of a nitrile (RCN) typically gives RCH2NH2 under certain conditions. But wait, with H2 and Pd, maybe it's more about hydrogenolysis.

Wait, no, usually, catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles (RCN) with H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni or PtO2 gives primary amines (RCH2NH2). But if the catalyst is Pd, perhaps it's a different condition. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but I'm not sure about the exact conditions. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is converted to a methylene group (CH2) upon hydrogenation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitrile group in Compound B is adjacent to the hydroxyl group. So in the cyanohydrin, the structure is RCH(OH)CN. Then, when hydrogenated, the CN becomes CH2NH2? Or maybe it becomes CH2OH. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reduction of the nitrile group. Nitriles can be reduced to amines, but under different conditions. If we use H2 and a catalyst like Pd, perhaps it's hydrogenolysis. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is converted to an amine, but that's more with LiAlH4 or similar reagents. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to a methyl group. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternative approach: Let me think about the overall reaction steps. Let's outline each step.

1. Compound A (a ketone) reacts with HCN to form Compound B (cyanohydrin: R2C(OH)CN).
2. Compound B is hydrogenated (H2, Pd) to form Compound C. So perhaps the nitrile is reduced. Maybe the nitrile becomes an amine, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to a methylene group. Or maybe the nitrile is converted to an alcohol.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. When a nitrile (RCN) is hydrogenated under H2 with a catalyst like Pd or Pt, it typically converts to a primary amine (RCH2NH2). But another possibility is that under certain conditions, like with high pressure or
