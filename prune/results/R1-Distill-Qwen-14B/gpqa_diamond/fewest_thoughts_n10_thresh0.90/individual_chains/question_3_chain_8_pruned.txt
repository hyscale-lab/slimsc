Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it again carefully.

So, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the system. So for an operator O, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where ψ is the state vector.

So, the operator given is 10σz +5σx. To find the expectation value, I can compute it as 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩, because expectation values are linear, right? So I can split this into two parts: the expectation of σz multiplied by 10 and the expectation of σx multiplied by 5.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a superposition, I can write it as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Because when you measure σz on |↑⟩, you get +1, and the probability is |a|^2, same for |↓⟩ but with -1.

Let me calculate |a|^2 and |b|^2.

a = 0.5. |a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

b = sqrt(3)/2. |b|^2 = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3)/(4) = 0.75.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+⟩ and |−⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So, I can't directly compute the expectation value from the given state. I need to find another way.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by the formula 2*(|a|^2 - |b|^2) if I remember correctly. Or wait, let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for expectation value in terms of the components.

Alternatively, I can write the state as a column vector. Let's see: |↑⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0,1]^T. So the state ψ is 0.5*[1,0] + (sqrt(3)/2)*[0,1] = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The operator σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, to compute ⟨σx⟩, I can compute ψ† σx ψ.

Let me write it out.

ψ is:
[0.5,
 sqrt(3)/2 ]

So, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] since it's a row vector.

Now, compute ψ† σx ψ.

σx is:
[ [0,1],
  [1,0] ]

Multiplying σx by ψ:

σx * ψ = [0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2),
