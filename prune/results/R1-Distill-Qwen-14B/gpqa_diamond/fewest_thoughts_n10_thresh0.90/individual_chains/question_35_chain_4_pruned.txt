Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think this through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component angular momentum operator, A_y. The setup says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as c multiplied by S. Here, c is h/(4π), and S is a matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). 

Wait, let me write that down. So S is a matrix:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay = c * S, which means each element of S is multiplied by c. So, let's compute that.

c = h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix Ay is:
[ 0 , -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π) , 0 ]

We're supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me recall how to find eigenvalues. The eigenvalues a satisfy the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - a I would be:
[ -a     (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [(-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) * h² ) / (16 π²) ) ].

Wait, let's compute the product of the off-diagonal elements. (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is (1 * h²) / (16 π²). So the determinant equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. So a² = h²/(16 π²), which means a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, no, wait. Because the off-diagonal terms are multiplied as ( (-i h/(4π)) ) * (i h/(4π) ). So let's compute that: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. Then the product is (h²)/(16 π²) *1. So the determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, let me see. The options mention h/4π and other values. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But our eigenvalues are purely real here, right? Because the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues have real parts h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and zero imaginary parts. So any option suggesting otherwise can be eliminated.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't align with our findings. So probably not.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Let me think. Since A is the angular momentum operator (spin-½, maybe?), the square of A (like A²) should commute with Ay. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it should also be an eigenfunction of A². But what about Az? Well, Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenvectors are different. So a function can't be an eigenfunction of both Ay and Az. But it can be eigenfunction of both Ay and A². So option C says that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. So that might be a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. I'm not exactly sure what that means. The matrix has eigenvectors that form a basis for the space. But I'm not sure about the phrasing. Alternatively, the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. But the statement is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the matrix operator. Maybe it's saying that the eigenvectors form the basis, which is generally true for any diagonalizable matrix. So perhaps D is correct as a statement.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So let me go through each option again.

Looking at the eigenvalues:

We found a = ± h/(4π). So they are real, no imaginary parts. Thus, any option that talks about
