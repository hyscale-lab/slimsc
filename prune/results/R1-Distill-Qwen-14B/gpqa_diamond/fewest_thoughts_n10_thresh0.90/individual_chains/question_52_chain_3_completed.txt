--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and think through each part step by step.

The question is about a star's properties when it has and doesn't have dark spots. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. But wait, I'm a bit confused about what "overall photospheric effective temperature" means here. Oh, right, the effective temperature is a measure of the star's energy output. So when spots cover part of the surface, that part is cooler, so the overall emission would be less, hence a lower Teff.

Then the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—without spots compared to with spots.

Hmm. So the ratio observed is level 1 to level 2. Let's denote the ratio as N1/N2 when the star is spotted (R_spot) and when it's not (R_nospot). The question says that R_nospot / R_spot is the factor we need to find. Or wait, does it? Wait the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so R_nospot is larger than R_spot. So the factor is R_nospot / R_spot.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of populations of two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then higher T would make the exponential factor larger, which increases n2/n1. So if the temperature decreases, the ratio n2/n1 decreases.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed ratio of N1/N2 (so level 1 to level 2) decreases when stars have spots. So R = N1/N2. Without spots, R is higher; with spots, R is lower. So R_nospot > R_spot.

Wait, but if the temperature decreases, how does that affect R = N1/N2? Let me think. From the Boltzmann equation, N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is E_upper - E_lower. So if T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller. So N_upper/N_lower decreases, which means N_lower/N_upper increases. So R = N1/N2, assuming 1 is lower and 2 is higher, would be N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) ) = 1/( (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(kT) ) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio R = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So R is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) multiplied by the statistical weights ratio.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Hmm, that's in the near UV. Wait, but how does that relate to the energy difference between the levels? The energy difference ΔE can be found from the wavelength using the equation ΔE = hc/λ. But wait, since the energy levels are such that the photon emitted has wavelength λ, so ΔE = hc / λ. Let me compute ΔE.

H is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. C is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters. So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) )

Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, each photon has that energy. To get per atom, it's the same. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to convert to eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ΔE in eV is (1.372e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that seems high. Because for visible light, the energy is much lower. Wait 1448 Angstroms is about 145 nm, which is in the near UV. The energy per photon is about 8.56 eV, which is quite high. Hmm, but I think that's correct because shorter wavelengths correspond to higher energy.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 m = 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV. Right.

So ΔE = 8.56 eV.

But wait, wait—no, wait. The transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Å. So when an electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon of energy ΔE. So E2 - E1 = ΔE = 8.56 eV.

So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So the temperature T is lower. How does that affect the ratio R = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights (g1 and g2) are the same, which I think is a fair assumption unless told otherwise. So the ratio depends on the exponential term.

So when T decreases, the denominator k T becomes smaller, so the exponent (ΔE)/(k T) would be larger, making the exponential term larger. Wait, no: because (E2-E1) is positive, so when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp( (ΔE)/(k T) ) increases.

So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (ΔE)/(k T) ). So if T decreases, R increases. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio R decreases. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, no, the problem says the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, R is lower than when they're not. But according to my previous calculation, if T decreases, R increases. So that seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the temperature change and its effect on R.

Wait, the star's overall effective temperature when spotted is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K when not. So when the spots are present, T is lower.

So without spots, T is higher, so R = (n1)/(n2) = ... Let's think again. If T increases, (ΔE)/(k T) decreases, so exp( (ΔE)/(k T) ) decreases. So R would decrease. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, wait, wait a second. Let me get this straight. The exponential term is exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is exp( ΔE/(k T) ). So if T increases, then ΔE/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes smaller, and the exponential term gets smaller. So the ratio R = (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( ΔE/(k T) ). So when T increases, R decreases. When T decreases, R increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the observed ratio R decreases. Wait, that contradicts. So perhaps I messed up the definition of R.

Wait, wait! The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R_nospot is higher than R_spot. So when T decreases (star has spots), R decreases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, R = n1/n2 increases. So why is R going down when T is lower?

This suggests either my understanding is wrong or perhaps I messed up the definition of R. Let me re-examine.

The problem states: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So R = N1/N2. When spots are present, R decreases.

So R_nospot > R_spot.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Assuming g1/g2 is a constant (same for all cases), then R is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So exp( that ) increases. So R increases.

But the problem says that when T decreases (star has spots), R decreases.

This suggests that either I got the ratio backwards, or perhaps I'm using the wrong energy levels.

Wait, perhaps level 1 is higher than level 2. Suppose the problem says that when the star has spots, R = N1/N2 decreases. Let me re-express.

Wait, maybe the energy levels are such that E1 > E2? If that's the case, then E2 - E1 is negative, so the exponent is negative, and the ratio would change differently.

Wait, but the transition corresponds to a photon emitted with wavelength 1448 Å. So when an electron moves from a higher energy level (E2) to a lower (E1), it emits a photon. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So E2 > E1.

Hmm. So if the ratio R is N1/N2, meaning the ratio of lower level to higher level, then R = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but in that case, when T decreases, R increases. So if the star has spots (lower T), R increases. But the problem says R decreases. So something's wrong.

Ah! Maybe the observed ratio is N2/N1, not N1/N2. Because the problem says 'the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)'. So it's N1/N2. Wait, no, the wording says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)", but the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So perhaps the ratio is actually N2/N1, and it's decreasing when the star has spots.

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the ratio. Let me re-read:

"...the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So the ratio is N1/N2. So when the star has spots, R = N1/N2 is lower.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1)/(k T) is positive. So as T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so R decreases.

So when T is higher (no spots), R is smaller. But the problem says R decreases when the star has spots (which have lower T). Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Let me clarify:

Without spots, Teff is 6000 K. With spots, 5500 K.

So when the star has spots, T is lower. So T goes down.

In the Boltzmann equation, R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

With lower T, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp(...) increases. So R increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, R decreases. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is such that E1 > E2? But that can't be, because the emitted photon corresponds to E2 to E1 transition, right? So E2 > E1.

Hmm. I must be making a mistake in the way I'm applying the Boltzmann equation. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should think about the ionization or excitation conditions.

Wait, another thought: the effective temperature of the star affects the ionization state of the atoms. At lower temperatures, more neutral atoms are present. But wait, in this case, the star's Teff is lower, so perhaps more neutral Ti is present. But how does that affect the ratio of the two levels?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of spots affects the overall photospheric temperature, which in turn affects the excitation of the atoms.

But thinking back, the ratio R is N1/N2. When T decreases, according to the Boltzmann equation, R should increase. But the problem says R decreases when spots are present, so when T decreases. So that suggests that our initial assumption must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which would imply that E2 > E1. So higher energy level is 2.

So in that case, when T increases, the ratio N1/N2 should decrease, because more atoms are excited to higher levels.

Wait, looking at the equation:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then E2-E1 is positive. So exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So as T increases, this exponent becomes closer to zero, making the ratio N2/N1 approach (g2/g1). So if T increases, N2/N1 increases (if (g2/g1) >1).

Wait, but wait. If T increases, the exponent -ΔE/(k T) becomes less negative, so the exponential term is larger. So N2/N1 increases when T increases.

So N1/N2 decreases when T increases.

In our case, when the star has spots, T is lower. So without spots, T is higher, so N1/N2 is lower.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. But according to this, when T decreases (spots present), N1/N2 increases.

Wait, but that's contradictory. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption. Let me try to write down the equations again.

Let me denote:

Level 1: lower energy (E1)

Level 2: higher energy (E2)

So E2 > E1.

The Boltzmann equation says:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So when T increases, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases (because denominator is larger, so the exponent becomes less negative). So n2/n1 increases.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(...) decreases, so n1/n2 decreases.

So, the observed ratio N1/N2 is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

When T increases, N1/N2 decreases.

So when the star has spots (T decreases), N1/N2 increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, N1/N2 decreases. So that's the opposite of what the equation predicts.

Hmm. So this suggests that perhaps the observed ratio is actually the inverse, or I'm missing something else.

Wait another thought: perhaps the spots are cooler, but the rest of the star is hotter. Wait, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the average T is lower.

Wait, but maybe the presence of spots doesn't just lower the average T but also affects the excitation. Alternatively, maybe the spots are regions where the temperature is much lower, but the surrounding is hotter. Wait, no—wait, when spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K, which is lower. So the average T would be lower.

But in that case, according to the equation, the ratio N1/N2 should increase when T decreases. But the problem states that N1/N2 decreases when spots are present. So maybe something else is going on.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the entire star's temperature but about the temperature of the regions where the Ti lines are formed. Maybe the spots are cooler, and the surrounding is hotter. But the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio R is being observed as the average over the entire surface, which includes the spots. So when spots are present, the average T is lower, so the average R increases. But the problem says that the ratio R decreases when spots are present. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the Saha equation as well, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which would include the Saha equation for ionization. But the question is about neutral Ti, so perhaps higher ionization (lower T) would lead to more neutral atoms. But how does that affect the ratio of the two levels?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the excitation temperature. The ratio N1/N2 is determined by the local temperature. So if the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower, the local temperature where the lines form is lower. So that would affect the ratio.

But wait, without spots, the Teff is 6000 K; with spots, 5500 K. So the excitation temperature (if it's the same as T) would be lower in the spotted case.

So, using R = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T))

We can compute the ratio for T1 = 6000 K and T2 = 5500 K.

We need to find R1/R2, where R1 is the ratio without spots, R2 is the ratio with spots. The question asks for the factor by which R1 is larger than R2, i.e., R1/R2.

So let's compute R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Because (g1/g2) cancels out.

So:

R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE) / (k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

We know ΔE is 8.56 eV, as calculated earlier. Let's convert that to J.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE = 8.56 * 1.602e-19 = approx 1.371e-18 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

(ΔE)/(k) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.371 / 1.38) * 1e5 K ≈ 0.993 * 1e5 ≈ 99300 K.

Then,

(1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) K^-1.

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4 K^-1.

So,

1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4 = -1.515e-5 K^-1.

So,

(ΔE/k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 99300 K * (-1.515e-5 K^-1) ≈ -1.5065e0 ≈ -1.5065.

So,

R1/R2 = exp( -1.5065 ) ≈ e^-1.5065 ≈ approximately 0.221.

Wait, but that would mean R1 is 0.221 times R2. So R1/R2 is about 0.221. But that can't be right because when T decreases, R increases. So in the case where T goes from 6000 to 5500, R should increase. So R1 (at 6000 K) is less than R2 (at 5500 K). So R1/R2 would be less than 1. But the problem says that when T decreases (so 5500 K), R decreases. So according to this calculation, the ratio R1/R2 is 0.221, meaning R1 is smaller, and R2 is larger. So in reality, the ratio without spots (R1) is lower than when spots are present (R2), which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, but this is confusing. Let me correct the calculation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in computing (1/T1 - 1/T2). Because when T1 is 6000 and T2 is 5500, 1/T1 is less than 1/T2. So 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative.

So (ΔE/k) (1/T1 -1/T2) is negative. So exp of a negative number is less than 1.

So R1/R2 = exp( -1.5065 ) ≈ 0.221.

Which means R1 is about 22% of R2. So R2 is 4.53 times R1. Because R2 = R1 / 0.221 ≈ 4.53 R1.

Wait, but that would imply that when T decreases (spots present), the ratio R (N1/N2) increases. Which contradicts the problem statement that R decreases when spots are present.

Hmm. So let's see. According to our calculation, R1 (at 6000 K) is 0.221 * R2. So R2 is higher. So when the star has spots (lower T), R is higher. But the problem states that R decreases when spots are present. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the ratio. Let me make sure I'm calculating R1/R2 correctly.

Wait, wait. R1 is the ratio when there are no spots (T1=6000 K). R2 is the ratio when there are spots (T2=5500 K). The problem says that when the star has spots, R decreases. So R2 < R1.

But according to our calculation, R2 is larger than R1. Which contradicts.

Ah, wait, maybe the problem is considering the observed flux or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is the inverse. Wait, perhaps R is N2/N1, not N1/N2.

Let me consider that. Suppose the ratio is N2/N1.

Then, R = N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, R decreases. When T decreases, R increases.

In the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio R (if it's N2/N1) would be higher. But the problem says that the ratio *decreases* when spots are present. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the definition of R wrong.

Wait, maybe the ratio is (n2)/(n1), and when spots are present, this ratio decreases. Let me see.

In that case, R = n2/n1.

Without spots, T is 6000 K; with spots, 5500 K.

So R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) )

R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k * 5500) )

So R2/R1 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE/k) ( (6000 -5500) ) / (5500 * 6000) ) )

So (ΔE/k) is about 99300 K.

(1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500) / (5500 *6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) = 1/(66,000) ≈ 1.515e-5.

Multiply by (ΔE/k) 99300 K: 99300 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.5065.

So R2/R1 = exp(1.5065) ≈ 4.505.

So R2 is about 4.5 times R1.

So if R is N2/N1, then when the star has spots, R increases by a factor of ~4.5. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So that doesn't fit.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this with numbers.

Let me compute the ratio R = N1/N2 for both temperatures.

Given ΔE = 8.56 eV.

Compute R1 (6000 K) and R2 (5500 K).

R = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Assume g1/g2 = 1 for simplicity.

So,

R1 = exp( 8.56 eV / (k * 6000 K) )

But need to convert eV to J.

8.56 eV = 8.56 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.371e-18 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

ΔE/(k T) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K) )

= (1.371e-18) / (8.28e-20) ) ≈ (1.371 / 8.28) ) * (1e-18 / 1e-20 ) ) = (0.1654) * 100 ≈ 16.54 ≈ 16.54.

Wait, that's a very large exponent. So R1 = exp(16.54), which is a huge number, like 1e7, but that can't be right because when T is high, the ratio R should be lower.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, wait, wait: 1.371e-18 J divided by (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K) = (1.371e-18) / (8.28e-20) ) = (1.371 / 8.28 ) * 1e2 ≈ 0.1654 * 100 ≈ 16.54.

So exp(16.54) is a very large number, about e^16.54. Which is way over a million. But that can't be correct because when T is high, the ratio R should be lower. So clearly, I'm making a mistake.

Wait a second, I think I messed up the units. Let me recompute:

ΔE = 8.56 eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → 8.56 eV = 8.56 * 1.602e-19 = 1.371e-18 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

T1 = 6000 K.

So,

ΔE/(k T1) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K) ) = (1.371e-18) / (8.28e-20) ) ≈ 16.54.

So exp(16.54) is way too big. But that can't be right because according to Boltzmann, when T is high, the ratio N1/N2 should be lower.

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The formula is R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) )

But for T=6000 K, the exponent is 16.54. exp(16.54) is a huge number. So R is huge, meaning N1 >> N2. But when T increases, the exponent decreases, so R decreases.

Wait, but wait: 16.54 is a large number. So exp(16.54) is about 1.2e7 (since e^10 is about 22026, e^15 is about 3.269e6, e^16.54 is approx 8.5e6? Let me compute e^16.54.

But regardless, that's a huge number, which would imply that at 6000 K, most of the atoms are in level 1, and very few in level 2.

Wait, but that can't be correct since level 2 is higher in energy. So at high T, more atoms should be excited to higher levels. So N2 should be higher, meaning N1/N2 should be lower.

But according to this calculation, the ratio N1/N2 is extremely high when T is 6000 K, which would mean that N2 is negligible. But that's not possible if the transition is observed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent.

Wait, let me recompute the exponent for T=6000 K.

ΔE = 8.56 eV = 1.371e-18 J.

k T = 1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K = 8.28e-20 J.

So,

ΔE/(k T) = (1.371e-18) / (8.28e-20) ) ≈ 16.54.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. But wait, perhaps I didn't account for the fact that the energy levels are in eV and the rest in joules, but perhaps I should have used the same units.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exponent using eV and eV/(k T) in terms of eV/(eV) since k in eV/K is known.

Ah, yes! Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, and k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent using eV and k in eV/K.

Let me try that approach.

ΔE = 8.56 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

T1 = 6000 K.

So,

ΔE/(k T1) = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 * 6000) → compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *6000 = 0.517.

So,

8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.54.

Same result. So exponent is 16.54.

Wait, so that would imply that the ratio R = N1/N2 is exp(16.54) ≈ 9.5e7. That's a huge ratio. So N1 is way more than N2. But when T increases, this ratio decreases because the exponent decreases. So at higher T, the ratio is smaller.

Wait, but I'm getting a ratio of N1/N2 that's extremely high. So when T is 5500 K (with spots), let's compute R2:

ΔE/(k T2) = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *5500) → denominator is 8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.4739.

8.56 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.07.

So R2 = exp(18.07) ≈ 3.5e7. So R2 is larger than R1. So R2/R1 = (3.5e7)/(9.5e7) ≈ 0.368. So R2 is about 0.368 * R1.

Wait, but that would mean that when T decreases (spots present), the ratio R = N1/N2 increases. Because R2 is larger than R1.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this is contradictory. So either the problem is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Scenario:

Without spots, T = 6000 K, R1 = N1/N2 = exp(16.54) ≈ 9.5e7.

With spots, T=5500 K, R2= exp(18.07) ≈ 3.5e7. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no! Wait, no: when T is lower, (ΔE/(k T)) is higher, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) is higher, so R is higher. So R2 would be higher than R1.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, R decreases. So in this case, R increases, which is the opposite of what the problem says. So either the problem is wrong, or I'm making an error in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Let me compute N2/N1 instead.

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming g2/g1 =1, then N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for T=6000 K,

exp( -16.54 ) ≈ 1.8e-7.

So N2/N1 is about 1.8e-7.

For T=5500 K,

exp( -18.07 ) ≈ 2.2e-8.

So N2/N1 decreases when T decreases. So when the star has spots (lower T), N2/N1 is lower, which means N1/N2 is higher. So the ratio N1/N2 increases.

But the problem says that the observed ratio decreases. So perhaps the problem is referring to N2/N1, which is lower when T is lower. So when spots are present, N2/N1 is lower, so the ratio decreases.

But according to the problem statement, "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T decreases, the ratio decreases. So the factor by which this ratio changes is R_nospot / R_spot.

In this case, R_nospot = 1.8e-7, R_spot=2.2e-8.

So R_nospot / R_spot = (1.8e-7)/(2.2e-8) ≈ 8.18. So about 8.2 times.

Looking at the options, option B is ~7.8, which is close to 8.2.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio observed is N1/N2, which would increase when T decreases. So in that case, the factor would be R1/R2 = (exp(16.54))/(exp(18.07)) ) = exp( -1.53) ≈ 0.217.

Which would be a factor of 0.217, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the reciprocal of what I'm calculating. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio R decreases. If R is N2/N1, then when T decreases, R decreases. So R_nospot is larger than R_spot.

So the factor is R_nospot / R_spot = (N2/N1)_nospot / (N2/N1)_spot = (1.8e-7) / (2.2e-8) ) ≈ 8.18.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 8.2. The closest option is B) ~7.8.

But let me compute more precisely.

Compute ΔE/(k T) for each case.

ΔE = 8.56 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

At T1=6000 K:

x1 = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 * 6000 ) = 8.56 / (0.51702) ≈ 16.542.

exp(-x1) = exp(-16.542) ≈ 1.83e-7.

At T2=5500 K:

x2 = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *5500 ) = 8.56/(0.473935 ) ≈ 18.073.

exp(-x2) = exp(-18.073) ≈ 2.22e-8.

So R_nospot = 1.83e-7, R_spot=2.22e-8.

Factor = (1.83e-7)/(2.22e-8) = approx 8.24.

So the factor is approximately 8.24. Looking at the options, option B is ~7.8, which is close, but option D is ~2.9, which is much smaller.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem says that the ratio observed decreases when the star has spots. So if R is N2/N1, then R decreases when T decreases. So the factor R_nospot / R_spot is 8.24, which is about 8.2.

But the options have B as ~7.8. So perhaps a more precise calculation would yield closer to 7.8.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers.

Let me recompute x1 and x2.

x1 = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000 )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6000 = 0.51702.

x1 = 8.56 / 0.51702 ≈ 16.542.

exp(-x1) = exp(-16.542) = ?

We can compute this using natural logs.

exp(-16.542) ≈ e^-16.542.

We know that ln(1.83e-7) is about -16.54, but let me compute it accurately.

Using a calculator:

e^-16 ≈ 1.125e-7.

e^-16.5 is about 1.05e-7.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator would give precise values, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ratio of R1 to R2 as the factor, where R is N1/N2.

If R is N1/N2, the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (16.54 -18.07) ) = exp(-1.53 ) ≈ 0.217.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, R decreases, which would mean R1/R2 is greater than 1. Which is not the case here.

So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of the two ratios when the problem refers to N2/N1.

So the factor is approximately 8.2, which is close to option B (~7.8), but perhaps the precise calculation would yield closer to 7.8.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is being taken as hc/λ where λ is in meters, and I made a mistake in units.

Wait, let me recompute the ΔE using precise units.

ΔE = hc/(λ)

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact)

c=299792458 m/s.

λ=1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.62607015e-34 J·s * 299792458 m/s ) / (1448e-10 m )

Calculate numerator: 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So,

ΔE = 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Which is the same as before.

So converting to eV:

1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.565 eV.

So no error in ΔE.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the ratio N2/N1, which would have R_nospot = exp( -16.54 ) ≈ 1.83e-7, R_spot = exp( -18.07 ) ≈ 2.22e-8.

So R_nospot/R_spot ≈ 8.24. So the factor is about 8.2. But option B is 7.8.

Wait, perhaps I should do a more exact calculation.

Compute x1 = 8.56 / (0.51702) = 16.542.

exp(-x1) = exp(-16.542) = e^-16.542.

Similarly, x2= 8.56/(0.473935) ≈ 18.073. exp(-x2)=e^-18.073.

Let me compute ln of 1.83e-7.

ln(1.83e-7)= ln(1.83) + (-7 ln(10)) ) ≈ 0.603 + (-7 *2.3026) = 0.603 -16.118 ≈ -15.515.

But x1 is 16.542, so e^-16.542 is approximately e^-16.5 ≈ 1.05e-7.

Wait, but earlier I thought e^-16.5 is about 1.05e-7.

Wait, let's compute e^-16.542.

We know that e^-16 ≈ 1.125e-7.

e^-16.542 = e^(-16) * e^(-0.542) = 1.125e-7 * e^-0.542.

e^-0.542 ≈ 0.581.

So e^-16.542 ≈ 1.125e-7 *0.581 ≈ 6.56e-8.

Similarly, e^-18.073.

e^-18 = e^(-16) * e^(-2) → 1.125e-7 * 0.1353 ≈ 1.524e-8.

e^-0.073 ≈ 0.929.

So e^-18.073 ≈ 1.524e-8 * 0.929 ≈ 1.415e-8.

So R_nospot = 6.56e-8, R_spot=1.415e-8.

Factor = 6.56e-8 / 1.415e-8 ≈ 4.63.

Wait, that's about 4.6, which is close to option C (4.5). But that's contrary to previous calculations.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait, I think I messed up the approach. Because I thought R_nospot is e^-x1 and R_spot is e^-x2. So factor is (e^-x1) / (e^-x2 ) = e^{(x2 - x1)}.

Because x2 > x1, so x2 - x1 is positive, so e^{(x2-x1)}=e^{1.53} ≈ 4.63.

So R_nospot / R_spot = e^{(x2 -x1)} ≈ 4.63.

So the factor is about 4.6. So the ratio R_nospot is higher than R_spot by a factor of about 4.6.

So the options have C as ~4.5, which is close.

But earlier when I considered R as N2/N1, I had a factor of ~8.2. Now, when considering R as N1/N2, the factor is ~4.6, which is option C.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if R is N2/N1, then when T decreases, R decreases, so R_nospot > R_spot. The factor is R_nospot/R_spot ≈8.2, which is not an option, except close to B)7.8.

If R is N1/N2, then when T decreases, R increases, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the ratio (n2/n1) and find its factor.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So if the ratio is (n2/n1), then when T is lower (spots present), (n2/n1) decreases. So R_nospot/R_spot is the factor by which it decreases.

So R = (n2/n1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So R_nospot = exp( -ΔE/(k *6000) )

R_spot = exp( -ΔE/(k *5500) )

Factor = R_nospot / R_spot = exp( (ΔE/(k) ) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) )

Which is:

exp( (ΔE/k) * ( (6000-5500)/(5500*6000) ) )

= exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (500/(33,000,000)) )

= exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (1/66,000) )

Compute ΔE/(k) = (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K ) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99300 K.

So,

(ΔE/k) * (1/66,000) ) = 99300 / 66,000 ≈ 1.5045.

So exp(1.5045 ) ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which matches option C.

Ah! So this is the correct approach. Because the problem says that the ratio R decreases when spots are present, and R is (n2/n1), which is the ratio that decreases when T decreases. So the factor R_nospot/R_spot is 4.5, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) under the given conditions. The ratio is influenced by the effective temperature of the star, which decreases from 6000 K (no spots) to 5500 K (40% surface covered by spots). The transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, allowing us to calculate the energy difference, ΔE, using the relation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate ΔE
- Planck's constant, \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
- Speed of light, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Wavelength, \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Convert to electron volts (eV):
\[
1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta E = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Boltzmann Equation
The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]
where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \)), and \( T \) is the temperature.

Assuming \( g_1 = g_2 \), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Ratio at Two Temperatures
For \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spots present):
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \frac{8.56}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(6000)} \approx 16.54
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = \frac{8.56}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})(5500)} \approx 18.07
\]

The ratios are:
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1}(T_1) = \exp(-16.54) \approx 1.83 \times 10^{-7}
\]
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1}(T_2) = \exp(-18.07) \approx 2.22 \times 10^{-8}
\]

### Step 4: Factor of Change
The factor by which the ratio changes is:
\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\frac{n_2}{n_1}(T_1)}{\frac{n_2}{n_1}(T_2)} = \frac{1.83 \times 10^{-7}}{2.22 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 8.24
\]

### Step 5: Interpretation
The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. This implies the ratio refers to \( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \), which decreases as \( T \) decreases. The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 8.24, which is closest to the option **B (~7.8)**.

### Final Answer
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **8.2**, matching option **B (~7.8)**.

ANSWER: B
