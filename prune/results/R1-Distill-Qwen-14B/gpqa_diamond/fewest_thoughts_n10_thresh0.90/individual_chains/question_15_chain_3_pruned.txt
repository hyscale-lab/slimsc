Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the transit method depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But the probability isn't 100%, right?

Wait, I think the probability of a transit is given by some formula involving the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. Oh right, the formula is something like R*/a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis times 180/pi or something like that. Or maybe it's (R* / a) multiplied by a factor. Wait, I think the probability P is approximately (R*/(a)) * (something else?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, I remember that the geometric probability for a transit is (R*/a) where R* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So the probability is higher when R* is larger or when a is smaller. Because if the planet is closer (smaller a), it's more likely that its orbit crosses our line of sight.

In this case, both host stars have the same radius. So R* for both is same. So the probability depends on the semi-major axis a. Because if a is smaller, the (R*/a) ratio is higher, which increases the transit probability.

Wait, but wait. The orbital period is given. So I can find the semi-major axis using Kepler's third law. Right, because Kepler's law says that P² is proportional to a³/(M*), where M* is the mass of the star. Since the planets are Earth-like, I guess their masses are similar, but the question says both have same masses. But for Kepler's third, I think it's more about the star's mass and the planet's period.

So let me think. Kepler's third law says (a^3)/(M*) = (P^2) * (G/(4π²)), but since we can compare the two planets, we can maybe take the ratio.

Planet_1 has an orbital period P1, and Planet_2 has P2=3
