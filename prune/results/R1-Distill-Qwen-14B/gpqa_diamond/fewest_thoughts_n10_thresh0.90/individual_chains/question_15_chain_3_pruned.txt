Okay, so I have this astronomy question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So, we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, why would the more massive star have the same radius? Maybe Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, so it's a bit bigger but not in this case because the radii are same.

The main thing here is the transit probability. I think the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, right? Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 divided by (a_planet / R_star), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability for a planet is given by the formula (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p)) * (some orbital plane alignment factor). No, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_p), but I'm not so sure. Or wait, I think the probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's size, but squared because it's a geometric probability.

Wait, I remember that the probability P that a planet transits is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)), but that doesn't seem right. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Wait, perhaps another approach.

The transit probability is the area of the circle where the planet can be in front of the star, divided by the area of the planet's orbit. But wait, the planet's orbit is a circle with radius a_p, and the chance that it's aligned so that the planet's path intersects our line of sight. So the area where the planet can be is the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth, which is π (R_s)^2. The area of the planet's orbit is π (a_p)^2. So the probability is (R_s / a_p)^2. Wait, that makes sense because if the star is small relative to the orbit, the probability is lower.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. Because if a_p is large, the planet's orbit is much bigger than the star's disk, so the chance is lower. So P = (R_s / a_p)^2? No, wait, because if the star is bigger relative to the orbit, the probability is higher. Wait, no, actually, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Wait, the probability should be proportional to (R_s / a_p) squared, because the area where the planet can transit is a circle of radius R_s, and the planet's orbit is a circle of radius a_p. So the probability is (R_s / a_p)^2. Because the area is π R_s^2 over π a_p^2, so (R_s/a_p)^2.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a_p is very large, the transit probability would be low, which makes sense. But wait, if a_p is small, meaning the planet is close to the star, the probability would be high because R_s is much larger than a_p. Wait, no, if a_p is small, the star appears larger relative to the planet's orbit, so the probability is higher.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. For example, if a_p is 1 AU and R_s is 1 solar radius, which is about 1/200 AU. So R_s/a_p is 1/200. (1/200)^2 is about 2.5e-4, which is a very low probability, which makes sense because planets are rarely aligned.

Alternatively, maybe the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p). Because R_p is the planet's size, so the area is (R_p^2)/(R_s^2) times the probability of alignment, which involves the orbital distance.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Let me recall from what I studied. The probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)), but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits. The alignment probability is approximately (R_s / a_p), considering that the planet's orbital plane is randomly oriented with respect to our line of sight. So the total probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p).

Hmm, that sounds more accurate. So P = (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p).

Wait, but R_p is the planet's radius. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are roughly the same. So R_p1 ≈ R_p2.

So, the probability for each planet would be proportional to 1/(R_s a_p). So the planet with a smaller R_s and a smaller a_p would have a higher probability.

Wait, but in this problem, the host stars have the same radius. Because it says both host stars have the same radii. So R_s1 = R_s2.

So, the probability for each would be P1 ~ 1/(R_s * a1) and P2 ~ 1/(R_s * a2). Since R_s is same for both, P is inversely proportional to a_p.

So, the planet with a smaller a_p will have a higher transit probability.

Wait, but the question says that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, P1 = P_2 / 3.

Given that, we can compute a_p using Kepler's third law. The law is P
