Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, but wait—each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, perhaps we should consider the uncertainty in the energy of each state to determine if they can be distinguished.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference (E2 - E1) between the two states. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty from the lifetimes might make it hard to tell them apart.

So, let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1 with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and similarly for ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference should be significantly larger than the uncertainties in each state so that they can be resolved.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and then ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum or something. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy measurement would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, or perhaps the larger of the two.

Wait, let me think. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, the uncertainty in energy for a state is roughly ħ divided by the lifetime of that state.

So for E1, with τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1), and similarly for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 τ2).

But since τ2 is longer than τ1 (1e-8 s vs 1e-9 s), ΔE2 will be smaller than ΔE1. Because a longer lifetime means a lower uncertainty in energy. So ΔE1 is ħ/(2 * 1e-9) and ΔE2 is ħ/(2 * 1e-8). Which means ΔE1 is about 10 times larger than ΔE2.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 is (E2 - E1). To distinguish them, this difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in each state's energy. Or is it the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of how the energy difference relates to the uncertainties. Let's compute the uncertainties.

First, I know that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert ħ into eV·s.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ (1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-19) eV·s ≈ approx 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, for each state:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) eV.

Calculating that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV. So about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for ΔE2: ħ/(2 τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV, which is about 3.29e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainty in E1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and E2's uncertainty is about 3.29e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 is (E2 - E1) = ΔE. To clearly distinguish them, this ΔE needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, or the maximum uncertainty. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, but wait, I think when considering two states, the maximum possible uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy has its own uncertainty, so the difference between them would have an uncertainty of ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let me think again. The energy difference's uncertainty is actually the root mean square, perhaps, but in many cases, for simplicity, it's considered as the sum. Alternatively, maybe it's the maximum of the two.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it. Suppose we have two energies, each with their own uncertainties. The uncertainty
