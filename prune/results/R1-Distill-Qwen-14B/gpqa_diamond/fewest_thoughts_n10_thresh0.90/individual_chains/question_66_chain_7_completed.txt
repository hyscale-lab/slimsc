Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that symmetries are crucial in physics because they dictate the form of the laws and theories. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are four symmetries: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, so I need to figure out which ones are necessary for all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, what's SMEFT again? It's a framework where you write down all possible interactions allowed by the Standard Model symmetries, but without assuming a particular UV completion. So the operators are built respecting the same symmetries as the SM.

So, what are the symmetries of the Standard Model? Well, the SM is Lorentz invariant, so all SM interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT, being an effective theory based on SM, must respect that too. That means Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a yes.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT should too. But wait, does SMEFT consider all possible operators without worrying about Poincare? Or is that automatically included? I think operators in SMEFT are built respecting Poincare. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected by the operators. So 1 and 2 would be correct.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on Poincare. Poincare is the combination of Lorentz and translations. Since operators in SMEFT are constructed in a way that respects the SM's symmetries, which include Poincare, so yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is correct.

Then, what about CP and CPT? The Standard Model is not CP symmetric because of the CKM problem; CP violation exists. So do SMEFT operators have to respect CP? I don't think so. In the SM, CP is not a symmetry, so the SMEFT operators can violate CP. So the operators don't have to respect CP, meaning option 3 is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. The question says "must be respected by all operators." So the operators must have the symmetry, but if the symmetry isn't a part of the SM, then they don't have to. Since SM doesn't have CP as a symmetry, the effective operators can violate it. So option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? The SM respects CPT symmetry. So in the SMEFT, which is based on the SM, the operators must respect CPT. Because if the UV theory respects CPT, the effective theory must also respect it. Wait, but wait: SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, and CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. I think that all renormalizable theories respect CPT, right? So operators in SMEFT should respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So let me recap. The operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries, but not necessarily CP (3).

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, is Poincare symmetry the same as including Lorentz and translations? Because in SMEFT, operators are built in such a way that they transform correctly under Lorentz, but are they required to respect Poincare? Since Poincare implies that the theory is invariant under translations and Lorentz transformations. The SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that respects the SM symmetries, which include Poincare symmetry. So yes, 2 (Poincare) is also a symmetry that operators must respect.

So which options are correct: 1, 2, 4.

Looking at the choices, option C is 1,2,4. So correct answer would be C.

Wait, but another thought: isn't Poincare symmetry automatically satisfied if Lorentz and translation symmetries are? Because Poincare is the combination. So when you say operators must respect Lorentz, do they also have to respect translations? Because operators are local, so they have to make sense under all Poincare transformations. So yes, SMEFT operators respect Poincare.

So the correct answer is C. So the options are A) 1,2; B)3,4; C) 1,2,4; D)1,3,4.

So the correct answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). These symmetries include Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Operators in SMEFT are built in a way that respects these symmetries, as they are derived from the SM framework.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT operators are constructed to maintain this symmetry. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, and SMEFT operators are built to maintain SM symmetries, Poincaré symmetry (option 2) must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation, as seen in the CKM mechanism. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry (option 3), and this symmetry does not need to be preserved.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is an effective theory derived from the SM, CPT symmetry (option 4) must be respected.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
