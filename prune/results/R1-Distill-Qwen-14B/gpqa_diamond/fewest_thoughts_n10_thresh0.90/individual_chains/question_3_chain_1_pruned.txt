Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator gives the average outcome of measuring that observable on a large number of identical systems in the same state. So for a given operator O, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. So I can split this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx. Then sum them up.

First, let me find the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, I can write ψ as a column vector. Let me recall, in the standard basis, |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ is a vector with components [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The expectation value of σz is ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩. Since σz is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. The probability of measuring +1 (i.e., |↑⟩) is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. The probability of measuring -1 (i.e., |↓⟩) is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4, since (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the expectation value for 10σz would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto σx. Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is off-diagonal. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is a bit trickier because it involves the coherences of the state.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can expand it.

Alternatively, another approach is to note that the expectation value of σx for a spin-1/2 state is given by 2 times the real part of the product of the first component and the complex conjugate of the second component. Wait, let me think: for a state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation of σx is 2 Re(a b*).

Wait, no, σx is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|), so ⟨σx⟩ is |a|^2 + |b|^2 but wait, no. Let me compute it properly.

Let me write ψ as a column vector: ψ = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Then, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so σx |ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute it properly. 

⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of ψ. Since the coefficients are real, it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So:

σx * |ψ⟩ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, the inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) * 2. Because each term is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) and sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5. So adding them together gives 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 * 2 = 0.5 * sqrt(3) * 2/2? Wait, no.

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = (sqrt(3))/4.

Adding them together gives (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but I thought it might be something else. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the expectation value of σx for a spin-½ state. Oh right! For a spin state in the state |θ, φ⟩, the expectation value of σx is sinθ cosφ.

In our case, the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me see what θ and φ are.

The state can be written as cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩. Comparing, we have cos(θ/2) = 0.5. So θ/2 = 60 degrees, so θ=120 degrees.

And e^{iφ} = 1, so φ=0. Therefore, sinθ cosφ = sin(120°) * cos(0°) = (sqrt(3)/2) * 1 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Which matches what I found earlier. So that's correct.

So the expectation of σx is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, so the expectation of 5σx would be 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 *0.866 ≈4.33.

So the total expectation value would be the expectation of 10σz (which was -5) plus the expectation of 5σx (≈4.33).

Adding them: (-5) + 4.33 = -0.666..., approximately -0.6667.

Wait, that's roughly -0.6667, which to one decimal place is -0.7. Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations, especially the part about σx.

Wait, another way to compute ⟨σx⟩: (a b* + a* b ), since σx has the form [[0,1],[1,0]], so ψ^† σx ψ = (a* b + a b*) where ψ = a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩. Since a and b are real here (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2), so this becomes a*b +ab* = 2ab.

Wait a minute! Because a and b are real, a* is a, and b* is b. So, 2ab.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me compute that:

a =0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (0.5*sqrt(3)/2 )= (2) * [ (sqrt(3)/4) ] = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So same result as before. So that's correct.

So, 5σx has expectation 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈4.3301.

So 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, let me compute 5*sqrt(3)/2:

sqrt(3)=1.73205, so 5*1.73205 ≈8.66025. Divided by 2 gives 4.330125.

So total expectation is -5 +4.330125 ≈-0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in the approach.

Another approach: The expectation of 10σz +5σx is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩, as I did.

Yes, that makes sense because expectation is linear.

So
