Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try.

The problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So, the cavity isn't right at the center of the conductor but somewhere off to the side.

Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question asks for the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is its distance from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta. And we know l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some properties when it comes to electric fields. Oh wait! When a conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surface. But wait, the conductor here is initially uncharged. So when a charge is placed inside the cavity, what happens?

I think the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Oh right, the cavity isn't conducting, but the conductor itself will respond. The charge +q inside the cavity will cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor was uncharged. When you place a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the total charge of the conductor is zero? Wait, no. The conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer must have +q. Because total conductor charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Oh wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer must have +q. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, so inner is -q, outer is +q, sum zero. Yeah.

But wait, I'm not sure. Another approach: The conductor was neutral. When you put +q inside the cavity, the cavity is surrounded by the conductor's material. The charges in the conductor (which were initially zero) will redistribute. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the charge +q attracts the opposite charge on the conductor. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner is -q, outer is +q, so total for conductor is zero.

So the conductor has an inner surface charge of -q and an outer surface charge of +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So, for points outside a conductor, the electric field is the same as if all the charge of the conductor were concentrated at its center. That's the shell theorem, right? So the outer surface's charge is +q, so the field at P would be due to this +q as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, but wait. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the conductor's radius is R, so L is larger than R. Thus, the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / L². Here, Q_enclosed is the charge outside the Gaussian surface, which is the outer surface's charge, which is +q.

Wait, but the outer surface has +q, so the enclosed charge is +q. So the electric field at P would be E = k * q / L², where k is 1/(4πε₀).

Looking at the options:

Option B is E = (1/(4π ε₀)) q / L².

Option D is same but q / l². Option A is q over (l-s cosθ)^2, and C is (l + s cosθ)^2.

But wait, I thought it's the same as a point charge at the center because of the conductor's properties. So why would any of the other options be correct? But the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, so the field depends on L. So the field is as if all the charge were at the center.

So the correct E is (1/(4π ε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but let me think again. The charge inside the cavity is +q, and the conductor's inner surface has -q, outer surface +q. Is there any other charge distribution that could affect the field at P?

No, because for any point outside the conductor (radius R), the field only depends on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. So the outer surface is the only charge contributing, and it's +q, so E is k q / L².

Wait, but let me imagine the setup. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the +q is placed inside the cavity, which is not at the center of the conductor. But the conductor's charge distribution on the outer surface is symmetric. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution, regardless of where the cavity is located. Because the conductor is a sphere, and the cavity is inside, but the conductor's material allows the charges to move freely. So the outer surface's charge +q will distribute uniformly, making the electric field outside as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, but what if the cavity's position affects the charge distribution on the outer surface? Hmm. Oh no, wait. No, because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution regardless of the position of the cavity. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will rearrange to maintain electrostatic equilibrium, which in a symmetrical conductor like a sphere, would distribute uniformly.

Wait, but wait a second. The cavity is not at the center, so the charge inside is off-center. But the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, but it's located on the inner surface. So the inner surface's charge distribution would be non-uniform, but the outer surface's charge is +q and would be uniform. Because the conductor is a sphere, any internal charge distribution (even if off-center) would cause the outer surface to have a uniform charge.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think. If the cavity is off-center, then the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge of -q, but this charge would be more concentrated in the region near the cavity. But the outer surface of the conductor, which is a sphere, would have a uniform +q charge because any excess charge would distribute itself uniformly on the outer surface of a conducting sphere.

Wait, no. Wait, no, that depends on the nature of the conductor. The conductor is a single piece (a solid sphere with a cavity) and is a conductor. So, any charge on the outer surface would distribute uniformly, but the inner surface's charge distribution would depend on the position of the cavity.

But for the electric field outside the conductor, the field only depends on the total charge outside the Gaussian surface. So in this case, the Gaussian surface at point P is outside the conductor, so the only charge enclosed is the +q on the outer surface, regardless of where the cavity is. So the field at P would be as if the charge +q is at the center of the sphere, and the distance is L.

Wait, but the point P is located at l from the cavity's center. The problem says that l and L are larger than R, so P is outside both the conductor and the cavity. The distance between the cavity's center and the conductor's center is s. So the point P is some point in space. But since the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, the field at P due to the outer surface's +q is k q / L^2, regardless of where the +q is located within the conductor.

Wait, but wait. So the outer surface has +q, so the field outside is as if the charge is at the center. So the field at P would be E = k q / L^2, which is option B.

But looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have a conductor with a cavity, and the charge inside the cavity is off-center. The conductor's inner surface has an induced charge of -q, but the outer surface has +q. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed. So the field outside is the same as a point charge at the center. So regardless of where the +q is located inside the cavity, the outer charge is uniformly spread, so the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

So the point P's distance from the center is L, so E = (1/(4π ε₀)) (q) / L².

Looking at the options, that's option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) induces a charge of $-q$ due to electrostatic induction. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the net charge.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside a spherical conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface. The outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, and the field outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor. This is a consequence of the shell theorem.

3. **Distance and Field Calculation**: The point $P$ is located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The formula $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2}$ does not apply because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on $L$, not on the distance $l$ from the cavity's center or the angle $\theta$.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The formula $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$ matches the electric field due to the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface of the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The formula $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2}$ is not relevant to the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The formula $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2}$ would apply if the field were being calculated at a point inside the conductor or near the cavity, but not outside.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as the electric field at $P$ is determined solely by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor and its distance $L$ from the center.
