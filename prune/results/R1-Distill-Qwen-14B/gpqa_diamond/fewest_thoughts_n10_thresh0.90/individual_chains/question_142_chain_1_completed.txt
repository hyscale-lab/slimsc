Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, what do I remember about density matrices?

Density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of projectors.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. It represents a completely mixed state, meaning the qubit is in a completely uncertain state between |0⟩ and |1⟩. So it's a classical mixture of the two basis states.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. So the density matrix for a maximally mixed state would correspond to a point at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, what's the Bloch vector for a general qubit density matrix? The density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). The length of r can't exceed 1 because the density matrix must be a valid state (traceless, Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and unit trace).

Let me break down the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1,0, and |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0,1. Adding them together, the sum is [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

So ρ = I/2. Now, using the general form of a density matrix in terms of Pauli matrices: I = σ_0 (the identity matrix), and σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. So, the general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

Our ρ is (I + 0·σ_x + 0·σ_y + 0·σ_z)/2. So the Bloch vector r has components (0,0,0). That means the point is at the origin of the Bloch sphere coordinates.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

I think that's right. The maximally mixed state is in the center of the Bloch sphere.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state of a qubit, which corresponds to a classical mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix is expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. The length of \(\mathbf{r}\) must satisfy \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\) to ensure the density matrix is valid.

For the given \(\rho\), it simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

which implies that all components of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) are zero (\(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\)). This corresponds to the point at the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is 

\[
r = (0, 0, 0).
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
