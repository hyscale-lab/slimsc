Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in a given state. I remember that when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. And the probability is related to the square of the amplitude of the eigenstate component in the original state.

The state vector is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I think I should first normalize this state because in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized to 1. Let me calculate the norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) times the column vector (-1, 2, 1). Okay, got it.

Next, the operator P has a matrix. Let me write that out. The first row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Hmm, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for operator P because when we measure P, the state will collapse to one of its eigenvectors.

Wait, but maybe before that, I should check if the operator P is Hermitian because observables must be Hermitian. Let me see. The (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) element is also 1/sqrt(2), so the matrix is symmetric. So yes, it's Hermitian, which is correct for an observable.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of P. Solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI)=0. Let me set up the matrix P - λI:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]

The determinant would be a bit tricky, but maybe I can find it by expanding. Alternatively, I can look for symmetries or patterns. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix has certain properties. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: since the matrix seems to have a structure where each non-zero element is 1/sqrt(2), except the diagonal which is -λ. Maybe I can guess the eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the eigenvectors. Let's consider the eigenvectors of P.

Suppose I have a vector (x, y, z). Let me write the equation (P - λI) v = 0.

So,

-λ x + (1/sqrt(2)) y = 0 --> equation 1.

(1/sqrt(2)) x - λ y + (1/sqrt(2)) z = 0 --> equation 2.

(1/sqrt(2)) y - λ z = 0 --> equation 3.

Let me see if I can find a non-trivial solution.

From equation 1: y = λ x * sqrt(2).

From equation 3: (1/sqrt(2)) y = λ z --> z = y/(sqrt(2)*λ) = (λ x sqrt(2)) ) / (sqrt(2) λ ) ) = x. So z = x.

Now, substituting y and z into equation 2:

(1/sqrt(2)) x - λ y + (1/sqrt(2)) z = 0.

Substituting y and z:

(1/sqrt(2)) x - λ (λ x sqrt(2)) ) + (1/sqrt(2)) x = 0.

Simplify:

(1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) x - λ^2 sqrt(2) x = 0.

2/sqrt(2) x - λ^2 sqrt(2) x =0.

Simplify 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2), so:

sqrt(2) x - λ^2 sqrt(2) x = 0.

Factor out sqrt(2) x:

x (sqrt(2) - λ^2 sqrt(2)) )=0.

Assuming x ≠0, then sqrt(2) (1 - λ^2) )=0.

So 1 - λ^2=0 --> λ^2=1 --> λ=1 or λ=-1.

Wait, that gives us two eigenvalues: 1 and -1. But the matrix is 3x3, so there must be three eigenvalues. Oh, but maybe one of them is zero? Because the trace of P is the sum of the diagonal elements. Let me calculate the trace of P.

Trace of P: 0 (from first row) + 0 (second) + 0 (third) =0. So sum of eigenvalues is 0. If two are 1 and -1, the third must be 0. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0.

So the possible outcomes for measuring P are 1, -1, 0. The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but the question says, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

So, the process is: first measure P, getting 0, then measure Q, getting -1.

Alternatively, the question could be interpreted as the joint probability of P=0 and Q=-1 in successive measurements. But since the state collapses after each measurement, the first measurement of P affects the state before measuring Q.

So the procedure is:

1. Start with state |ψ⟩ = [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6).

2. Measure P. Find the probability of getting 0, and the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector of P.

3. Then, measure Q on this new state, and find the probability of getting -1.

The product of these two probabilities (if they are independent, which they are in successive measurements) would give the joint probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Wait, but let me think: When you measure P, the state collapses to an eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q is done on this new state. So the overall probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 in the new state.

Alternatively, if the initial state has
