Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, so like a hollow part. The center of this cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and r is smaller than R. So the conductor is bigger, and the cavity is inside it, not touching the walls I think.

Now, someone places a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the point P is outside the conductor, which means it's outside the sphere of radius R. The conductor was initially uncharged, but now it has a charge inside the cavity. So how does this affect the electric field outside?

I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields. Oh right, the electric field inside a conductor material is zero in electrostatic equilibrium. But the cavity is inside, so the conductor's charges can move. But since the conductor was neutral, when a charge is placed inside the cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, let me think. When a charge is placed inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor being neutral, the charges inside the conductor redistribute. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge equal and opposite to q. So if the charge inside is +q, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q. Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance, making the total charge of the conductor +q. Or wait, no. The conductor was initially uncharged, so the total charge after induction should be zero. Because the conductor itself hasn't been given any charge, just the cavity has +q. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q so that the total conductor's charge is zero? Wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the sum of the induced charges should be zero. So inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q. Wait, that
