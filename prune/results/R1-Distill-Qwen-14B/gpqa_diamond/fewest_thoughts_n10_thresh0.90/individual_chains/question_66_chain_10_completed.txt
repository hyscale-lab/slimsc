Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. 

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where all possible higher-dimensional operators are included, respecting the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So the question is, which of these symmetries are among those.

Let's think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model is Lorentz symmetric. SMEFT operators should preserve this because they're just adding higher-dimension terms that still fit into the same framework. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected. So point 1 is correct.

2. Poincare symmetry: Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Oh wait, Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translational symmetries. But wait, in effective field theories, we usually work in a Lorentz-invariant framework, but do the operators need to respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it automatically included? Hmm, I think Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry that includes both. But I'm not 100% sure. Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it must be Lorentz-invariant because effective theories are usually Lorentz-invariant. Wait, but Poincare symmetry also includes translations. Do effective theories respect translations? Well, effective theories are usually formulated in terms of fields and interactions, but they might not necessarily include translations as a symmetry. Wait, no, because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, you can have translations as symmetries as well. But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, Poincare symmetry is part of the foundation of relativistic theories. So I think SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. Or does it? Or is Poincare a broader symmetry that might not be needed? Wait, no, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so Poincare would be automatically included since Lorentz plus translations gives Poincare. But wait, I'm not sure if all operators in SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry. Or maybe it's that since they respect Lorentz, they don't necessarily need to respect Poincare? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry is automatically respected if Lorentz is. Or perhaps the operators don't need to respect it because SMEFT is valid only up to some scale, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. I'll come back to this point.

3. CP symmetry: Hmm, the Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry in all cases. Wait, no, the SM does have a CP symmetry, but it's not necessarily respected in nature, as in, there's CP violation. But wait, SMEFT includes all possible operators that respect the SM gauge symmetries. Oh, but some operators may break CP. Wait, no. Because the SM doesn't have a global symmetry like CP beyond what is already present. So operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM, which includes gauge symmetries but not necessarily CP. So, CP symmetry is not necessarily a symmetry that must be respected. So point 3 might not be correct.

4. CPT symmetry: I think CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, especially those that are Lorentz invariant. Because in any Lorentz-invariant QFT, CPT symmetry holds. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. So point 4 is correct.

So now compiling, which options are correct:

Point 1: Yes (Lorentz), point 2: uncertain, point 3: No, point 4: Yes.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because otherwise, the theory wouldn't be Lorentz-invariant. Also, because SMEFT is a relativistic effective theory, it must respect Lorentz symmetry. So point 1 is correct.

Point 2: Poincare symmetry. But Poincare includes translations, which are global symmetries. SMEFT may or may not respect translations, but in reality, effective theories are often formulated in a way that makes sense in a curved spacetime, but I think operators don't necessarily have to respect translations. Wait, no, in any case, in SMEFT, the operators are built from the SM fields, and the theory is Lorentz-invariant, but translation symmetry (i.e., global time and space translations) isn't necessarily a symmetry that operators must respect. Or wait, maybe the fact that the theory is Lorentz-invariant implies some aspects of Poincare, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translations. Since operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant, but I'm not sure about the necessity of respecting translations.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the symmetries again. The Poincare group consists of Lorentz transformations and translations. So, if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it doesn't automatically respect Poincare symmetry unless it's also translation-invariant. But in SMEFT, the validity is up to a certain scale, and the theory isn't translation-invariant because it's an effective theory. So perhaps Poincare symmetry isn't a requirement for the operators in SMEFT. So point 2 (Poincare) isn't necessarily a symmetry that must be respected by all operators. Therefore, point 2 is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe Poincare symmetry is required because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that Poincare is automatically respected because the operators are built in a way that respects Lorentz, and translation is a separate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that in SMEFT, operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM is Poincare-invariant because it's a relativistic theory. So, yes, SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. Thus, point 2 is correct.

Wait, but which is it? Let me double-check. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Lorentz invariance is part of the Poincare group. So if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, does it automatically respect Poincare? No, because Poincare includes translations. So while the Lagrangian is built to be invariant under Lorentz, it may not be invariant under translations. But in effective field theories, the existence of a scale (Λ) suggests that the theory isn't translation-invariant, because the energy scale is important. So maybe SMEFT does not necessarily respect translation symmetry, hence Poincare symmetry isn't a requirement. So point 2 (Poincare) is not necessarily required.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering whether the operators themselves must be Poincare-symmetric. But Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translations. Since the operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory, that's point 1. But I'm not sure about Poincare, which is a larger symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which is point 1. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is an effective theory, not necessarily symmetric under translations (because it's applicable up to a certain energy scale), so operators don't need to respect Poincare symmetry. So point 2 would not be correct.

So, the correct points are 1 (Lorentz) and 4 (CPT). Wait, but the options don't have 1 and 4 together except for option D: 1,3,4. Wait, no, option D includes 3 (CP), which I thought wasn't necessarily required.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators. So which options include 1 and 4?

Looking at the options:

Option C: 1,2,4 → includes 2, which is Poincare.

Option D: 1,3,4 → includes CP symmetry, which I thought wasn't required.

Hmm, but wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So perhaps Lorentz and CPT must be respected, but Poincare and CP may not be.

Wait, but the options don't have 1 and 4 alone as a choice. Let's see the options:

A) 1,2 → Lorentz and Poincare.

B) 3,4 → CP and CPT.

C)1,2,4 → Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

D)1,3,4 → Lorentz, CP, CPT.

Hmm, so if I decide that points 1 and 4 are correct, but 3 and 2 are not, then the correct option would be none of the options. But that can't be because the options must have one correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about point 2. Let me think again.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. If operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz, but not necessarily translations, then Poincare isn't necessarily a symmetry that operators must respect. So operator need not be Poincare symmetric, only Lorentz.

So the correct points are 1 and 4, but that's not an option. Wait, but looking at the options, none have only 1 and 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering point 4.

Wait, CPT symmetry. In any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT must hold. So if the theory respects Lorentz, it must respect CPT. So point 4 is correct. So yes, all operators must respect CPT.

So the correct points are 1 and 4. But looking at the options, which option includes 1 and 4?

Looking at options:

Option C: 1,2,4 → includes 2 which I'm not sure about.

Option D: 1,3,4 → includes 3 which I thought is not required.

Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that all operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, but not Poincare or CP.

Wait, but the options don't have an option with 1 and 4 only. So perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about point 2. Maybe Poincare is automatically respected because the operators are built from fields that are in the SM, which is Poincare symmetric. So if the SM respects Poincare, then SMEFT operators must as well.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that only Lorentz and CPT must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

But the available options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assessment.

Wait, let me go back.

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. SMEFT is an effective theory that is Lorentz-invariant, so all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (point 1 is correct). What about Poincare? Since SMEFT is a relativistic theory, it implies that the theory is Poincare-invariant. So all operators must respect Poincare as well (point 2 correct). Then, about CPT: since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, CPT symmetry must hold (point 4 correct). What about point 3, CP? The SM doesn't enforce CP symmetry; in fact, CP is violated in the SM. Therefore, the SMEFT operators can include terms that break CP, so point 3 is not a required symmetry.

So the correct points would be 1, 2, and 4. Wait, no, because the question lists which must be respected. So point 3, CP, isn't required.

Wait, so if points 1, 2, and 4 are correct, which option is that? Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that's an option.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about whether SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry. If the SM respects Poincare, then SMEFT must as well, because it's an extension. So, point 2 is correct.

So, the correct points are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait no, because I thought that SMEFT doesn't have to respect Poincare because effective theories may not be translation-invariant. But since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, and if the theory isn't translation-invariant, then it doesn't respect Poincare. So point 2 may not be correct.

This is getting really confusing. Let me try to find a different approach. Perhaps I can recall that in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be gauge-invariant and Lorentz-invariant. There's no requirement for CP symmetry, as the SM itself doesn't have that. As for CPT, it's required because the theory is Lorentz-invariant.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz) and 4 (CPT).

Looking at the options, none have only 1 and 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that Poincare is not a required symmetry.

Wait, perhaps SMEFT does respect Poincare symmetry. Because the SM is Poincare-invariant. So, the effective operators must respect Poincare as well. So points 1 and 2 are correct. Then, point 4 is correct, so the correct points are 1,2,4.

So the correct option is option C: 1,2,4.

But wait, another angle: Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translations. But in an effective theory, the scale Λ breaks some of the symmetries because the theory is only valid up to that scale. So perhaps the effective theory isn't translation-invariant, thus not respecting Poincare symmetry. So point 2 is incorrect.

In that case, the correct points are 1 and 4, which would be points 1 and 4. But looking at the options, none have that combination. So maybe the correct answer is option C, meaning 1,2,4 are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that all operators must respect Lorentz and CPT, but not necessarily Poincare. So points 1 and 4 are correct. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the actual symmetries.

The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and it also respects CPT symmetry because it's Lorentz-invariant. However, the SM does not necessarily respect Poincare symmetry if translation symmetry is broken. But wait, the SM is translation-invariant because it's a local theory. Oh, right, translation symmetry is part of the Poincare group, and the SM is translation-invariant, so SMEFT must also be translation-invariant because it's an effective theory built from the SM.

Hmm. Oh, perhaps the correct answer is that the operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP.

Wait, but the question is which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

So, the correct answer would include Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Which is option C.

Wait, but Poincare includes Lorentz, so must all operators respect both? Or is the question about which of the options must be respected.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, but not necessarily others. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 1, 2, 4.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: I'll look for the correct answer in a reliable source. I recall that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Since it's a relativistic theory, it must respect Poincare symmetry. Because without translation invariance, it's not a relativistic theory in the usual sense. So SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry. And because it's Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry.

So the correct points are 1,2,4. So the option is C.

But wait, I thought that translation invariance is part of Poincare, and SMEFT isn't translation-invariant because it's an effective theory. But wait, no, effective field theories are built to respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory. Since the SM is translation-invariant, SMEFT must also be translation-invariant. So Poincare symmetry is required.

Thus, the correct answer would include 1,2,4, which is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, while respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, and all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for maintaining the consistency of the theory as a relativistic framework.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is an effective theory built from the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This ensures that the theory remains consistent with the principles of relativity.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not necessarily required for all operators in SMEFT. The Standard Model itself does not enforce CP symmetry in all cases (e.g., CP violation is observed in certain processes). Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories that are Lorentz-invariant. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement.

The correct option is **C) 1, 2, 4**.
