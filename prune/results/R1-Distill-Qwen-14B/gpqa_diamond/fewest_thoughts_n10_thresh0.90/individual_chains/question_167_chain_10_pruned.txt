Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha squared)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, non-Gaussianity is measured using relative entropy. The formula given is delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix and rho is the non-Gaussian state's.

So, I need to compute this delta_b. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Relative entropy of non-Gaussianity usually compares the state to the closest Gaussian state, right? So tau would be the Gaussian state that's closest to rho in some sense. Or maybe in this case, the reference is a specific Gaussian state, perhaps the thermal state or coherent state?

Wait, the question says the reference is a Gaussian state. So perhaps for the cat state, which is non-Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the steps I need to take.

First, I need to compute the density matrix rho for |psi>. Since |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

Wait, but I also need to find the reference Gaussian state tau. I'm not exactly sure which Gaussian state to use as the reference here. Maybe it's the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as rho? Or perhaps in this case, it's the state that the cat state is being compared to, which could be a coherent state or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the reference Gaussian state tau is the thermal state with the same photon number distribution as rho. Or maybe it's the Gaussian state that's the closest approximation to the cat state. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I remember that for non-Gaussian states, calculating non-Gaussianity via relative entropy usually requires finding the nearest Gaussian state to the given state. So the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity would be the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state.

But I'm not exactly sure how to compute that in this case. Let me try to outline the steps.

Step 1: Compute the density matrix rho for |psi>.

Since |psi> is a superposition, rho = |psi><psi|. So let's write it out.

|psi> = (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha> ) / N.

So rho = ( |alpha><alpha| cos^2 phi + |alpha> <-alpha| cos phi sin phi + |-alpha><alpha| sin phi cos phi + |-alpha><-alpha| sin^2 phi ) / N^2.

But wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, their density matrices are |alpha><alpha|, etc. So rho is a mixture of these states with certain coefficients.

But wait, rho is a pure state because it's a superposition. Because |psi> is a pure state, rho is a pure density matrix. So the von Neumann entropy for rho would be zero because a pure state has entropy S(rho) = 0. But wait, no, that's only if it's a single pure state. But in this case, rho is a pure state because it's a single vector in the Hilbert space. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, |psi> is a normalized state, so rho = |psi><psi| is a pure state. So the entropy S(rho) = 0 because for a pure state, the entropy is zero.

Wait, but then what about the reference state tau? If tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a coherent state, then what's its entropy? Coherent states are pure, so their entropy is zero. But that would make delta_b = 0, which is option D. But that can't be right because the question is about a non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Maybe the reference state isn't a coherent state but a thermal state? Or perhaps the reference is a Gaussian state with the same first moments as the cat state.

Wait, another approach: The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is defined as S(rho||tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state. But in the formula given, it's written as delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Wait, that's the same as S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. But if rho is a pure state, S(rho) is zero. So delta_b would be - S(tau). But S(tau) is non-negative, so delta_b would be negative. But the options are all positive, except D) which is zero.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Perhaps the formula is written as S(tau) - S(rho), so delta_b would be positive if tau is more mixed than rho.

Wait, but the formula given is [trace rho ln rho - trace tau ln tau] = S(rho) - S(tau). So if rho is a pure state, S(rho) is zero, so delta_b is - S(tau).

But if tau is a Gaussian state with lower entropy than rho, but wait, rho is pure (S(rho)=0), so S(tau) must be positive, so delta_b would be negative. But none of the options are negative, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to compute the relative entropy in a different way. Another possibility: The reference state tau is the maximally mixed state, which is Gaussian. No, that doesn't make sense because the maximally mixed state is a completely mixed state (like a highly mixed thermal state at high temperature), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy with rho. So, to compute the non-Gaussianity, you find the closest Gaussian state tau to rho and compute S(rho||tau), which is the relative entropy between rho and tau.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating things. Maybe the question uses a different approach. Let me think about the specific parameters given.

Given phi = -pi/4, and alpha = 0.5.

First, let me compute N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Compute sin(2phi): phi is -pi/4, so 2 phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) = -1.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

Compute exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So |psi> = [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.627.

Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> ≈ [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.627.

Hmm, but how does this help me compute the non-Gaussianity?

Wait, another approach: For a cat state, the non-Gaussianity can sometimes be calculated using the logarithmic negativity or some other measure, but this question specifies relative entropy.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is being calculated between the state |psi> and a reference Gaussian state. But which one?

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that would be expected if the superposition were between two coherent states, but perhaps for a specific parameter. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is a thermal state with the same average photon number as |psi>.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the properties of the state.

A Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. It's a non-Gaussian state. The non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian the state is compared to a Gaussian state.

In the relative entropy approach, the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. So, to compute this, I need to find the Gaussian state tau that is the closest to rho in the space of density matrices, and then compute S(rho||tau).

But how do I find this tau? Well, one approach is to compute the Gaussian state that matches the first and second moments of rho because the Gaussian state is uniquely determined by its first and second moments.

Wait, but for a cat state, the first moments (like the mean photon number) might not change much, but the higher moments (like the photon number distribution) would be more non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the first and second moments of rho and construct the corresponding Gaussian state.

Wait, the density matrix rho for the cat state is |psi><psi|.

The first moment is <a> = Tr( a rho ), where a is the annihilation operator.

Similarly, the second moment would involve something like <a^2>, but for a Gaussian state, the state is determined by <a>, <a^2>, etc.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact procedure. Let me try to compute <a> for rho.

Compute <a> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] [ <alpha| cos(phi) + < -alpha| sin(phi) ] / N^2 * a.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that each coherent state |alpha> has a mean value <a> = alpha. So when you take the superposition, the expectation value <a> for rho is (cos^2 phi * alpha + sin phi cos phi * (-alpha) + sin phi cos phi * (-alpha) + sin^2 phi * alpha ) / N^2.

Wait, but let's compute this step by step.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, so Tr(a rho) = <psi| a |psi>.

Compute <psi| a |psi>:

= ( cos(phi)*<alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha | ) / N * a ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N.

This simplifies to [ cos^2 phi <alpha| a |alpha> + cos phi sin phi <alpha| a |-alpha> + sin phi cos phi < -alpha | a |alpha> + sin^2 phi < -alpha | a |-alpha> ] / N^2.

But <alpha| a |alpha> = alpha, because a |alpha> = alpha |alpha>.

Similarly, < -alpha | a | -alpha> = - alpha.

What about the cross terms, like <alpha| a |-alpha> ?

Hmm, a is the annihilation operator. So a |alpha> = alpha |alpha>, but what about a | -alpha > ?

Wait, a |beta> = beta |beta>, so a | -alpha> = (-alpha)| -alpha>.

So <alpha| a |-alpha> = <alpha| (-alpha) | -alpha> = (-alpha) <alpha| -alpha>.

But <alpha| -alpha> is the inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which is exp(-|alpha|^2/2) exp( alpha (-alpha)* ) / sqrt( (1)(1) )) ?

Wait, the inner product <alpha | beta> = exp(-|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha* beta).

So here, beta is -alpha. So <alpha|
