Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax value. Like, plx = 1/distance (in parsecs, I think). So higher parallax means closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in the sky—does that mean they have the same density throughout space, or that their positions on the celestial sphere are uniform? Hmm. Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I think it's about the density of stars as a function of distance, which relates to parallax.

Wait, parallax (p) is related to distance (d) by p = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density (stars per volume) is constant. Let me think about the volume as a function of distance.

Imagine that we're looking out into space and considering a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere (4πr²) multiplied by dr. So the volume element is 4πd² dd, where d is in parsecs.

If the number density of stars is n (stars per cubic parsec), then the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/plx, let me substitute that in. Oh wait, since plx p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So substituting d as 1/p, the volume element becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * dp. Because dd is the change in d, but since d =1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, but I'm considering a small change in p, so perhaps I should express it in terms of p.

Wait, the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I think the question is asking how the number of stars in a range of parallax (like from p to p+dp) varies with p.

So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d is n * 4πd² * dr. But since p = 1/d, then dr = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because if d increases, p decreases. So when p increases by dp, d decreases by (1/p²) dp.

So substituting, the number of stars dN = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp. Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as p increases (so d decreases), but since we're considering small increments, maybe we can take the absolute value. So dN = 4 π n (1/p^2) (1/p^2) dp? Wait, no. Let me redo this.

Wait, d = 1/p. So dr, the change in distance, would be dr = - dp / p². Because derivative of d (1/p) with respect to p is -1/p². So when p increases by dp, d decreases by dr = - dp / p².

So the volume element is 4π d² dr. Substituting d and dr:

4π (1/p)^2 * (- dp / p² ) = 4π (1/p^2) * (- dp/p² ) = -4π dp / p^4.

But the number of stars, dN, is number density n multiplied by the volume. So dN = n * 4π (1/p^2) * ( - dp / p² ) )

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as p increases (moving to more distant stars), the volume shell is at higher p but lower d. But since we're considering small dp, the negative just tells us the direction, but for the count, we take the positive value. So dN would be 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that would mean dN/dp = 4π n (1/p^4). So the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4. But wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options are 1/p^4, 1/p^2, 1/p, 1/p^3. So option A is 1/p^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check if I did the substitution correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dr is n * 4π d² dr. Now, since plx p = 1/d, dr is the change in d. So when d increases by dr, p decreases by dp. So dp = - (1/d²) dr. So dr = - d² dp.

Substituting into the equation, dN = n *4π d^2 * (-d² dp) ) = -4 π n d^4 dp. But d = 1/p, so d^4 is (1/p)^4. So dN = -4 π n (1/p^4) dp. Again, the negative indicates the direction, but the magnitude is 4 π n / p^4 dp.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dp) is 4 π n / p^4. So the number of stars per unit range of p is proportional to 1/p^4. So for each unit increase in p, the number of stars in that range is ~1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So if p increases by Δp, the number of stars is proportional to (Δp) * (1/p^4) ), so the number per unit p is 1/p^4.

So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. When I'm considering the distribution of stars in terms of distance, the number of stars per log distance increases because of the volume. But here, the question is about parallax, which is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait another thought: if the number of stars per unit volume is constant, then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to d² times the thickness (dr). But when considering parallax, dr = - dp/(p²). So substituting, the number of stars in a thin shell is proportional to d² * ( - dp / p² ). Since d = 1/p, d² = (1/p²). So substituting, dN = (1/p²) * (dp / p^2) ) = dp / p^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax is 1/p^4.

So that would mean the correct answer is A) ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember that in some cases, when considering the distribution in terms of distance, the number of stars increases with (1/distance)^2. But wait, that's when considering the comoving volume, but when considering parallax, which is inversely proportional to distance, the dependence flips.

Alternatively, considering that the number of stars in a range of parallax (say from p to p + dp) would be the number of stars in the shell at distance d = 1/p, with thickness dr = - dp/p². So the volume of the shell is 4π d² dr = 4 π (1/p)^2 ( - dp / p² ) ) = -4 π dp / p^4. The number of stars is n times this, so dN = -4 π n dp / p^4. So the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4.

Hmm, but I'm trying to think if this is correct. Another approach: the number of stars in a range of parallax is the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density. So the volume as a function of p is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/(p^2)) ) dp? Wait, no—because dr is the thickness in distance, which is (1/p^2) dp. So volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/(p^2) dp) ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So yeah, the number of stars is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer should be A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars \( n \) is constant.

Consider a thin shell at a distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \). The volume of this shell is given by \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Since \( d = 1/p \), we can express \( dr \) in terms of \( dp \) as \( dr = -dp/p^2 \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( dr = -dp/p^2 \) into the volume expression, the volume becomes:

\[
4\pi d^2 dr = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{dp}{p^2}\right) = -\frac{4\pi dp}{p^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is the product of the number density \( n \) and the volume:

\[
dN = n \cdot \left(-\frac{4\pi dp}{p^4}\right).
\]

Taking the magnitude (since the negative sign indicates direction), the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dp} \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \), where \( p \) is the parallax. This matches option A.
