Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, the parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a star with a higher parallax is closer, and a lower parallax is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed... so the number density is the same in all directions. But wait, how does that translate when we look at parallax?

Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds, and it's given by the formula plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So as distance increases, plx decreases. 

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes. So for a given range of plx, how many stars are there? Let's say we have a small change in plx, delta_plx. How many stars are there in that delta_plx?

I think this is about the volume of space corresponding to a certain parallax range. Because stars are spread out uniformly, the number in a volume would be proportional to the volume. So the number of stars in a given parallax range depends on the volume of the spherical shell at that distance.

Wait, let's model this. For a given parallax plx, the distance d is 1/plx. The volume of a thin spherical shell between d and d + delta_d is approximately 4πd² delta_d. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell's volume is 4πr² dr.

But since plx is 1/d, delta_d = - (1/(d²)) delta_plx. Wait, let's see: d = 1/plx, so delta_d = - (1/plx²) delta_plx. Because if plx increases by delta_plx, d decreases, so delta_d is negative. But when we take absolute values, it's (1/plx²) delta_plx.

So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (delta_plx / plx²). Wait, wait—that's not quite right. Let me re-derive that.

d = 1 / plx, so delta_d = - (1) * delta_plx / plx². Because derivative of 1/x is -1/x².

But the volume element is 4π d² delta_d. So substituting:

d² = (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx².

delta_d = - delta_plx / plx².

So volume element is 4π * (1/plx²) * (delta_plx / plx²) ) → 4π (delta_plx) / plx^4.

Wait, that's 4π delta_plx / plx^4. Hmm.

But the number of stars in that volume is proportional to the volume. So number per unit plx would be proportional to (1/plx^4) * delta_plx, but wait, the question is about number per unit plx, so when you divide by delta_plx, you get 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that seems to suggest that the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But wait, the options given include 1/plx^4 as option A, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume of the shell and the volume element per unit plx.

Alternatively, the number per unit plx (N) is dN/dplx, the derivative of the number with respect to plx.

Since the number density of stars is uniform, the number of stars in a volume V is n * V, where n is the number density.

V is the volume between distances corresponding to plx and plx + delta_plx. So V is 4π (d)^2 delta_d. But d is 1/plx, so delta_d is (delta_plx) / (plx^2). Wait, because delta_d = (d^2 * delta_plx) / plx^3? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing terms.

Wait, let's express V in terms of plx.

V = 4π (d)^2 delta_d.

But since d = 1/plx, delta_d = delta (1/plx) = -1/(plx^2) delta_plx. The negative just means direction, but for volume, we take the absolute value, so delta_d = delta_plx / plx^2.

So substituting d and delta_d:

V = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (delta_plx / plx^2) ) = 4π delta_plx / plx^4.

So the number of stars in this volume is n * V = n * (4π delta_plx / plx^4).

The number per unit plx is (dN/dplx) = n * (4π / plx^4).

So as plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases as 1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, I'm a bit uncertain. Another way to think: in three dimensions, the volume element (dV) between two spherical shells of radius r and r + dr is 4πr² dr. Since r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, wait, that would be 4π (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx ), but wait, no, that's not right. Because dr = d(1/plx) = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So dV = 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

But since we're considering the absolute value, dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to dV, so 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is option A: ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but another thought: The number per unit parallax. Each parallax bin (like between plx and plx + dplx) corresponds to a volume as I calculated. So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the answer is A.

But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the variables. Let me think of it as a function. If I have a distribution where the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume of the shell, which, as plx decreases (distance increases), the volume of the shell at higher plx (lower d) is smaller, so more stars would appear in lower plx (closer stars). Wait, no, wait: higher plx means closer stars, so more stars per unit plx at high plx, since the volume is smaller, but stars are uniformly distributed.

Wait, no, the number per unit plx is higher when the volume per unit plx is larger. So when plx is small (large d), the volume per unit plx is smaller, thus fewer stars per unit plx. So as plx decreases, the number per unit plx (since 1/plx^4) becomes smaller.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit plx changes with plx. So when plx increases (i.e., the stars are closer), the number per unit plx increases because 1/plx^4 gets larger.

Wait, but that would mean that for larger plx (closer stars), there are more stars per unit plx. Which makes sense because you can only have so many stars close by, but in reality, the density is uniform, so more stars would be in the closer regions but spread over less volume.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's per unit plx. So the number per unit plx (n_plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So as plx increases, n_plx increases. So for each unit of plx, you have more stars when plx is larger.

But that seems counterintuitive. Because when you look closer, the volume is smaller, so for a given plx range, you have more stars. So per unit plx, the number increases as plx increases.

So for example, in the nearest parsec (plx ~1), the volume is 4π*(1)^2*(delta_plx) = 4π delta_plx. But wait, thinking about it, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number per unit volume is constant. So the number in a shell between r and r+dr is proportional to the volume, 4π r² dr. But since r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hmm. So that would mean that as plx increases, the number per unit plx increases as 1/(plx)^4. So the number goes up as plx increases. Which would mean that in higher plx (closer stars), there are more stars per unit plx. But wait, if the volume per unit plx is smaller, but the number per volume is the same, so the number per unit plx would be proportional to the volume per unit plx, which is 1/plx^4.

So I think the correct answer is A) ~ 1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and distance, as well as the volume of space corresponding to a given parallax range.

1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**:  
   Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d):  
   \[
   \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}
   \]  
   As plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

2. **Volume of a Spherical Shell**:  
   The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \(d\) with thickness \(\delta d\) is proportional to the volume of the shell:  
   \[
   V = 4\pi d^2 \delta d
   \]  
   Substituting \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\), we get:  
   \[
   V = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \delta d
   \]  
   The thickness \(\delta d\) in terms of \(\delta \text{plx}\) is:  
   \[
   \delta d = -\frac{\delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}
   \]  
   Taking the absolute value, \(\delta d = \frac{\delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}\). Substituting this into the volume formula:  
   \[
   V = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \frac{\delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4\pi \delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}
   \]

3. **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**:  
   The number of stars in the shell is proportional to the volume \(V\), so the number of stars per unit parallax (\(\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}}\)) is:  
   \[
   \frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}
   \]  
   This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \(\text{plx}^{-4}\).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \(1/\text{plx}^4\), which corresponds to **Option A**.
