Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium, right? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of the light beam is relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in that direction as well. But wait, noâ€”the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, like, if the glass is moving to the right towards the observer, then the light beam is moving to the right too.

I remember something about the speed of light in different media and how it's measured in different reference frames. Oh, right! In vacuum, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the observer's motion. But when light is traveling through a medium like glass, its speed is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, does that change when the medium itself is moving?

So the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. But does the speed of light in the glass change because the glass is moving? I think this might be a question of how velocities add in different reference frames. Maybe we need to
