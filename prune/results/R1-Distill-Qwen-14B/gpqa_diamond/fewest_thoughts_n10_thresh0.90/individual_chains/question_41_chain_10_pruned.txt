Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when a medium moves, it affects the speed of light through it, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

The problem says a light beam is propagating through glass with index n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam and towards the observer—so the glass is moving towards us, and the light is moving in that same direction. So, from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light inside it is also moving in that direction.

I think this is a problem involving the Doppler effect. Or wait, maybe it's about relativistic velocities and how the speed of light is measured in different frames. Oh wait, but in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is different. Wait, no, in a medium, the speed is c/n, where n is the refractive index. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light?

Wait, no. Because in special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c. But when it's in a medium, the speed is less, like c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that factor in?

Wait, maybe this is a case where we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when you have velocities in different frames, you add them using that formula. But wait, the velocity of light in the medium is already v_light = c/n, but if the medium itself is moving, then the observer in the lab would see the light's speed differently.

So let me think. Let's say the glass is moving with velocity v relative to the lab. The light's speed in the glass is u = c/n in the glass's frame, in the direction of motion. So when the glass is moving, how does that translate to the lab frame?

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving at speed v. So the speed of the light as observed in the lab would be u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²) ), but wait, that's the relativistic addition formula. Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly; you have
