Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it again. Hmm... It says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/parallax^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So like, plx = 1/distance, or something like that. So if plx is small, the distance is large.

The number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since plx is related to distance, maybe I can express N in terms of distance. Let me think.

Parallax plx is approximately equal to 1/d, where d is the distance. So plx = 1/d. Wait, actually, parallax in parsecs is given by plx (in arcseconds) = 1/d (d in parsecs). So if the distance is d parsecs, the parallax is 1/d arcseconds.

So if I substitute plx in terms of d, then N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me calculate that: 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Hmm. So I think they're asking for the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr, which is the differential number of stars with respect to r. So that's dN/dr.

If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be 5 r^4. But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because the original relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, so N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars up to a certain distance d is proportional to d^5. But wait, is that correct? Oh wait, no, maybe that's not the case. Because the number of stars in a volume would depend on the volume, which is proportional to r^3. But the question has a specific relation, not necessarily the usual case.

Wait the question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, this is N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the number of stars in a region of the sky is typically related to the volume. For example, in a sphere, the number of stars would be proportional to the volume, which is (4/3)π r^3. So the number of stars N ∝ r^3. But in this question, it's different because the relation is given as 1/plx^5. So that's a special case, not the usual.

So let's go back. N is proportional to 1/plx^5 → N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since plx = 1/d, then N = k * d^5.

But we need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit distance
