Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power, or 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, d = 1 / plx. Wait, that's right because closer stars have larger parallaxes. So as parallax increases, distance decreases.

The problem says the number of stars (let's call it N) varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Or, mathematically, N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But I need to relate this to distance. Since d = 1/plx, I can express plx in terms of d. Let's rearrange: plx = 1/d. So substituting that into the expression for N, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5.

Wait, let me compute that. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so 1 divided by that is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so it's the rate of change of N with respect to distance, or maybe the number of stars per unit distance? Hmm, maybe I need to think about this in terms of differential quantities.

Wait, the number of stars is N, and it's proportional to d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But how does the number change with distance? Maybe they're looking for dN/dr, which is the derivative of N with respect to r (since r is distance). Let me compute that.

dN/dr = derivative of
