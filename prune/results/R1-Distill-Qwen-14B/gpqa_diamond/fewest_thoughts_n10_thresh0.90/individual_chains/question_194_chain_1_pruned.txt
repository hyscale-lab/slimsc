Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The system consists of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Beta is 1/(kT), which is given. So each state contributes a term based on its energy.

First, I should figure out all the possible states. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them out.

The states are all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3. So, for example, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1; another state is S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1; and so on until all combinations are covered.

But calculating each state's energy might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way since the energy is symmetric in the spins. Let's think about the possible energies each state can take.

Let me see. The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are aligned or anti-aligned.

Wait, for each pair (like S1 and S2), if they are the same, S1S2 is +1, else -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 would be the sum of three terms each of +1 or -1.

So the possible values of the sum would be from -3 to +3 in steps of 2, I think. Let me confirm that.

Each term is ±1. So three terms can add up to 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1). Wait, no, wait. Let me compute all possibilities.

Wait, what's the sum when all three pairs are +1: 3. If two are +1 and one is -1, sum is 1. If one is +1 and two are -1, sum is -1. If all three are -1, sum is -3. So the possible sums of the three terms are 3, 1, -1, -3.

So the energy E would be -J multiplied by each of these values. So E can be -3J, -J, J, 3J.

Wait, let me compute:

If sum =3 → E = -J * 3 → E = -3J
sum=1 → E = -J *1 → -J
sum=-1 → E= J
sum=-3 → E=3J.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Wait, E is -J multiplied by the sum. So if the sum is 3, E is -3J. If the sum is 1, E is -J. If sum is -1, E is +J. Sum is -3 → E is +3J.

So the possible energies are -3J, -J, +J, +3J.

Now I need to find how many states correspond to each energy level.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3) where each S is ±1.

Let me consider the number of states where the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 equals 3, 1, -1, -3.

Alternatively, for each possible sum, count the number of states that give that sum.

So let's take each possible sum and find the number of states.

Sum = 3: All three terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are +1. So all pairs are aligned.

Which states satisfy this? Let's think. If all pairs are aligned, then all three spins must be the same. So S1 = S2 = S3.

So the possible states are (+, +, +) and (-, -, -). So two states give sum 3. So two states have E = -3J.

Sum = 1: The sum of the three terms is 1, which means two terms are +1 and one term is -1.

So how many such states are there?

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to count the number of states that lead to each sum.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of the number of aligned pairs.

Wait, another approach: each spin configuration can be either all aligned, or two aligned and one anti-aligned, etc.

Wait, but let me approach it systematically.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3).

Compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each triplet.

Let's list all 8 states:

1. (1,1,1): S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum=3.
2. (1,1,-1): S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → sum=1-1-1= -1? Wait wait, let me compute each term.

Wait, for (1,1,-1):

S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = 1*1 = 1.

S1S3 =1*(-1) = -1.

S2S3=1*(-1) = -1.

Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

Wait, so the sum is -1. So E would be -J*(-1) = +J.

Hmm, but earlier I thought sum can be 3,1,-1, -3. So this state has sum -1, corresponding to E = J.

Wait, but earlier I thought that sum=3 → E=-3J, sum=1 → E=-J, sum=-1 → E=+J, sum=-3 → E=+3J.

Hmm, perhaps I should make a table.

Let me list all 8 states and compute their sum and energy.

State 1: (1,1,1)
sum = 1+1+1=3 → E=-3J → exp(-β E) = exp(3Jβ)

State 2: (1,1,-1)
sum =1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 → E = J → exp(-β E) = exp(-Jβ)

State 3: (1,-1,1)
sum = (-1) + (1) + (-1) = -1 → E= J → same as state 2

State 4: (1,-1,-1)
sum = (-1) + (-1) + (1) → sum= -1 → E= J

Wait, let me compute each term:

For (1,-1,-1):

S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (1)(-1) = -1

S1S3 = (1)(-1) = -1

S2S3 = (-1)(-1) = 1

Sum = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1 → E= J.

State 5: (-1,1,1)
sum = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) → (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1 → E= J.

State 6: (-1,1,-1)
sum = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) → (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1 → E= J.

State 7: (-1,-1,1)
sum = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) → 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 → E= J.

State 8: (-1,-1,-1)
sum = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 → E = -3J → exp(3Jβ).

Wait, but wait. For state 8, S1=S2=S3=-1. So
