Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think. So the setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n, and it's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The observer is in the laboratory frame, watching this happen.

Wait, the question is asking about the speed of light relative to the observer. I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's index of refraction. Normally, when a medium is stationary, the speed v of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the medium is moving.

But wait, how does the movement of the medium affect the speed of light observed? I'm a bit confused. Because I recall that in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the source's motion. So regardless of whether the glass is moving, the light should still travel at speed c in the observer's frame.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So when the glass is at rest, the light inside it moves at c/n. But when the glass is moving, does that change anything?

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up frames here. Let me think. If the glass is moving, the light inside it is moving at c/n relative to the glass. From the lab frame, how do we see the speed of the light?

In the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light in the glass is moving at v + (c/n), but wait, that would be if velocities simply add. But that can't be right because in relativity, velocities don't just add like that when you're dealing with speeds close to c. Oh, but in this case, v is probably a small velocity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So the question is about the speed of light in the glass, which is moving. So from the lab frame, what is the speed of the light beam?

Wait, but no, the problem says the light is propagating through the glass. So the light's speed is within the glass. So its speed relative to the glass is c/n. But what about relative to the lab frame?

Wait, okay, perhaps it's better to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the glass is moving
