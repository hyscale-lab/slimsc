Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are A to D.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the beam is moving towards the observer, but the glass is also moving towards them. Hmm. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n relates to the speed v = c/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. So does that affect the speed of light inside it from the lab frame's perspective? I'm a bit confused because in the case of a medium moving relative to the observer, like in the Michelson-Morley experiment, the speed of light doesn't change in the medium's frame. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, no. Michelson-Morley found that the speed of light doesn't change with the observer's motion. But in this case, the glass is moving, and the light is inside the glass. So perhaps we're looking at a scenario where the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but from the lab frame, considering the glass's motion.

Wait, but according to the theory of relativity, especially special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c as observed in any inertial frame. But here, the light is in a medium, which complicates things. Because the medium's motion could influence it? Or maybe not. Because in the glass, the speed is v = c/n. But then, from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, do we need to apply a velocity addition formula?

Wait, the lab is the rest frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at v. The light is inside the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n. So what is its speed relative
