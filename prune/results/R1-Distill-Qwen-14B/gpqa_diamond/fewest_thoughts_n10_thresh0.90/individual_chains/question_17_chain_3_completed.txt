Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. And they're asking what the concentration of calcium ions is.

Wait, I remember that the formation constant (K) relates the concentration of the complex to the concentrations of the ions that form it. Oh right, for a complex like Ca-EDTA, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Or wait, I think EDTA is usually in a different form based on pH. But the problem says the pH is ideal, so I guess I don't have to worry about that part. So, the formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = K.

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's think about what's happening. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But the K is very large (5e10), which means the complex is very stable. So, the dissociation isn't going to be much. But the question is about the free calcium ion concentration, right?

So, let me model this. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. So, the concentration of the complex will be 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, I think x will be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That makes the calculation easier.

So, the expression for K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) )= K. But wait, in solution, each mole of CaEDTA^2- would produce one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So, if the complex dissociates, [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x, because each mole of complex gives one mole each. So the denominator becomes x * x = x².

The numerator is [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

So the equation becomes 0.02 / (x²) = 5e10. Wait, no, or is it the other way around? Wait, no, K is [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]). So 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10. Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13. Then x is the square root of that. The square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 4e-13 is 4 *10^-13. Square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5=1e-6.5? Wait, 10^(-13) is (10^-6.5)^2, because 6.5 *2 is 13. So yes, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5.

Wait, but 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7 (since 1e-7 is 1e-7, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 6.5 is halfway, about 3.16e-7). So sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 3.16e-7, which is approximately 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, so that's the [Ca²+] concentration. So looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The K is given as 5e10. So the formation constant is 5e10. So the equation is K = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]). Since [Ca] = [EDTA] = x, K = 0.02/(x²). So x² = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So yeah, option C is correct.

I think that makes sense. Because K is so large, almost all the complex stays intact, so the free calcium is very low. So the answer should be C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions dissociated from the complex. Since the dissociation is small (due to the large \( K \)), the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) remains approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \). Additionally, the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) are equal, both being \( x \). Substituting these into the equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
