Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+ and forms a complex. The question is about finding the concentration of free calcium ions when there's a Ca-EDTA complex present.

The problem states the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, stochiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1, so each Ca is bound by one EDTA. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its correct form to bind calcium effectively. Temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects calculations here.

They give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. Wait, I think K is the formation constant for the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-, and K is 5e10.

Wait, but what do I need to find? The concentration of free calcium ions. So the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M, which is the total concentration of the complex. But some of them might dissociate, releasing Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, when the complex dissociates, each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but the actual free [Ca²+] is much lower because K is very large, meaning the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the formula I think I should use is K = [Ca][EDTA]/[CaEDTA]. Oh wait, wait, no. The correct expression is K = ([CaEDTA])/([Ca][EDTA]). Because the complex is formed from Ca and EDTA. So K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-].

Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, then [CaEDTA] is 0.02. Assuming that the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. Wait, but if the complex doesn't dissociate much, [Ca²+] and [EDTA] would be very small. So maybe I can approximate that [Ca²+] is x, and [EDTA] is x as well? Because each dissociation gives one Ca and one EDTA.

Wait, let me think. Let me set up an ICE table. The complex is dissociating:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

Initial concentrations:
[CaEDTA] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0
[EDTA] = 0

Change:
At equilibrium, let x be the amount that dissociates. So:
[CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA] = x

So K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Wait a second, that can't be right because 0.02/(x²) =5e10. So solving for x:

x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-12 / 5e10? Wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, so sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5 ≈ 2*(3.16e-7) )=6.32e-7. Wait, wait, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-13)= approx 3.16e-7. So sqrt(4e-13)=2*3.16e-7=6.32e-7 M. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. So K is 5e10 and [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. So K = 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2). So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2/(5e10) = (2/(5))e-12 = 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5=2 * (1e-6.5)= about 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Yep, that's option C.


To determine the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) at equilibrium. Since the dissociation is minimal, the concentration of the complex remains approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
