Okay, so I'm trying to solve this crystallography problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. 

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, which I think is a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is a part of the cubic system. Oh right, rhombohedral has all edges equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (α=β=γ), but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees, making it a distorted cube. So in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees, which is quite a distortion.

The interatomic distance given is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice, which would be the lattice parameter a, right? Because in a cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a' for a simple cubic structure. So probably a = 10 A here.

Wait, but rhombohedral can sometimes be tricky because the unit cell isn't cubic. Oh, but for a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is still defined by a, b, c, but in this problem, they're all equal, so a = b = c. So the lattice is a rhombohedron with a = 10 A and angles 30 degrees each.

The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )) ), but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think it's d = (a)/(sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ))). Wait, no, that formula doesn't seem right. Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, I remember that for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance formula is d = 1/√( (h² A² + k² B² + l² C²) + 2 h k A B cos γ + 2 h l A C cos β + 2 k l B C cos α )) ), where A, B, C are the lattice parameters. But in the rhombohedral case, A = B = C = a, and all angles are equal to each other. So substituting, the formula simplifies.

Let me think. For a rhombohedral crystal with a = b = c = a0 and angles α=β=γ=θ, then the formula for d_hkl becomes:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, wait. Because in the denominator, the cross terms would involve cosines of the angles between the axes. In the general case, the cross terms are 2hk cos γ, where γ is between a and b axes, right? Hmm, maybe I should get the formula right.

Wait, another approach. The general formula is:

d^
