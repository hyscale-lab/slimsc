Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal with specific interatomic distances and angles, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

First, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal as well. Wait, no, wait. Actually, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where the unit cell is a rhombohedron. That means all edges are of equal length, but the angles between them are equal, not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are each 30 degrees. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron with a = b = c, and all angles 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait. Interatomic distance—the distance between atoms in the lattice. But in a crystal, that's the edge length of the unit cell. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', which is the edge length. So here, that's the case. So a = 10 Angstrom.

Now, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by: 

d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees here.

So substituting, since h = k = l =1 for the (111) plane.

Let me plug in the numbers. So,

d_111 = a / sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1*1 cos 30) + 2*(1*1 cos 30) + 2*(1*1 cos 30) )

Wait, because h, k, l are all 1. So each term:

First term is 1 + 1 + 1 =3.

Then the other terms: 2*(h k cos gamma) is
