Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity... Right, that's the method where you look for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum to detect planets. The idea is that the planet's gravity makes the star wobble, and that causes a shift in the spectral lines.

The question says that two stars with the same mass are being observed. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both stars have masses similar to the Sun, and the planets are in circular orbits. So, the host stars are identical in mass, and the planets are same mass, but their Doppler shifts are different. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7. The question is how many times longer is Planet #2's orbital period compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, the orbital period? So, I'm looking for the ratio of the periods, P2/P1.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the star's velocity. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula. Alternatively, I think there's a relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital parameters.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2) ) ) ]^ (1/3) * [ (2π) / P ]^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (because Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

So K ≈ [ (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3 )

Wait, no, let me get that right. Let me think again. The formula I remember is:

K = ( (27 * pi ) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (G * M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P )^(1/3) )

But that's getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula that relates the velocity amplitude to the orbital period and mass.

Wait, another approach: the stars are identical, so M_star is same for both. So the only variables are the planet masses and the orbital periods and the semi-amplitude K (the Doppler shifts).

But the question states that both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2.
