Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the question is about comparing the orbital periods of two planets around stars with the same mass as the Sun.

So, let's see. Both stars have the same mass, which is similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits, which probably simplifies things since eccentricity isn't a factor here.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, the formula I think is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K. K is given by ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )) ), but since e is zero here, maybe that simplifies it. Oh, wait, but since M_planet is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet as just M_star. So, K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) ) * (1/(2π)), or maybe I'm mixing up something here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula. The formula I remember is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since the inclination i is the same for both planets (as we're detecting them, so i is ~90 degrees, sin i ~1), that part cancels out when taking the ratio.

But wait, maybe I should think about how K relates to the orbital period and the mass. Because both planets have the same mass (since they're both Neptune-like), but the stars are the same mass, so the only varying factor is the orbital period.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbit. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) 

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So, K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But since both planets have the same M_planet and same M_star, the ratio of K1 to K2 will be (P2/P1)^(-1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(-1/3). Or, rearranged, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(-1/3) => (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^(-3).

Wait, let me get this right. Let me write it step by step.

K1 = (constant) * (M_p) / (M_s^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = same constant * (M_p) / (M_s^(2/3) P2^(1/
