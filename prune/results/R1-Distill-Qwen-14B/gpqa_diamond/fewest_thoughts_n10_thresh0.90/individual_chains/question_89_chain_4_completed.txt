Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange with the deuterated solvent.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what each reaction is doing.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH in excess... oh, that sounds like an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming an alkene. Wait, but adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so the positions matter.

But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on opposite ends or adjacent? No, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The numbering of 1 and 3 would be on adjacent carbons? Or maybe across a face. Hmm, but regardless, when KOH is heated, it should eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond.

So product 1 would be 1,3-didehydrodiamantane or something similar? Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diene because of the positions. Wait, wait, maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that elimination would form a bridge structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a more substituted double bond.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 shows four signals. Let me look at the given data. The 1H NMR of product 1 is: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but if product 1 is an alkene, where would the carbonyl come from? Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Because if heating with KOH could lead to elimination, but if there's another possibility: perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile. Wait, but in some cases, like with vicinal dihalides, elimination is more likely. But wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps elimination isn't possible because the bromines aren't adjacent? Because in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are not vicinal. Oh, wait, adamantane's structure: each carbon is connected to three others in a diamond structure. So 1 and 3 might be on adjacent positions but on the same diamond layer. Hmm, but maybe they're not. Alternatively, perhaps the two bromines are on bridgehead positions, which would make elimination difficult because of the bridgehead structure. Because bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed (Bredt's rule), so maybe elimination isn't possible. So then, what reaction occurs?

Wait, but if elimination isn't possible because of Bredt's rule, perhaps substitution occurs. But wait, KOH is a strong base, which would make substitution (SN2) unlikely for a bridgehead position because of the steric hindrance. So perhaps another reaction is taking place. Oh, wait, maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, no, because the IR has a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Wait, if it's a substitution reaction, but how? Hmm. Wait, perhaps the base is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but maybe more than one elimination. Wait, but with two bromines, maybe it's forming a conjugated diene, but in adamantane, that might not be feasible. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone, but how would that form?

Wait, another thought. The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, which is usually a ketone or ester. If the product is a ketone, how? Maybe the reaction is more about elimination followed by oxidation, but I don't think KOH would do oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann condensation? No, that's for cyclic esters. Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ether. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice, forming a diene. But if that diene isn't possible due to Bredt's rule, maybe it forms a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but again, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base induces a rearrangement, such as a pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement involves vicinal diols losing water to form carbonyl compounds. But wait, our starting material is dihalide, not diol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogen analog, like a dihalide undergoing some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Oh! I remember that when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes they can form ketones through an elimination-addition mechanism. For example, in the presence of a strong base like KOH, the dihalide can eliminate two equivalents of HX (here HBr) to form a carbene or some intermediate, which then rearranges. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon dehydrohalogenation forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, but let me think of the structure. Adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings, each connected in a diamond shape. So, if we have two bromines on carbons 1 and 3, which are adjacent in the structure, perhaps elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, which isn't possible. So, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as an elimination, but perhaps as a substitution.

Wait, but if elimination isn't possible, then perhaps the reaction is a double substitution. So KOH could substitute each bromine with an -OH group, forming a diol. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl; it would show O-H stretches. But the IR given is 1720, which is a strong, sharp peak, typical of a ketone or ester.

Hmm, maybe product 1 isn't a diol. Let me think again. Wait, another possibility: the dihalide could undergo a double elimination, but perhaps not in a way that forms a double bond. Maybe it abstracts a hydrogen and forms a carbene, which then would form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that usually involves elimination to form an aryl compound, which doesn't seem applicable here.

Wait, another angle: the NMR data. So product 1 has four signals in the 1H NMR. Let me parse that:

- 4.79 ppm (2H): possibly an -OH or maybe some -OCH₂- group. But wait, if it's an -OH, the peak might be broader, but perhaps in D₂O it would exchange. Alternatively, an -OCH₂- group, like in an ether. Or maybe it's a CH₂ adjacent to an electronegative atom.

- 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H): that's a lot of hydrogens in the same area. Maybe they're in a ring structure, like several equivalent CH₂ groups.

- 1.94 ppm (2H): perhaps another type of CH₂, maybe near a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the IR indicates a carbonyl group, which is likely a ketone. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone. How could that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH in such a way that it forms a ketone. Maybe via a neighboring group elimination. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps KOH is acting as a base, causing the dihalide to lose two HBr molecules and form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. For example, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, eliminating two HBr could form a carbonyl group. Oh! Wait, that's similar to the formation of diketones from dihalides. Let me think. When a geminal dihalide (two halogens on the same carbon) is treated with a base, it can form a ketone. For example, CH2Br2 with KOH can form acetone. But wait, in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, not geminal. So maybe that's not applicable.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination but a substitution. If each Br is replaced by an OH group, making a diol, but that wouldn't lead to a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that elimination forms a conjugated diene, but due to the adamantane structure, perhaps the diene is part of a ring, leading to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. The NMR has a peak around 4.79 ppm (2H). Maybe that's a CH₂ near an oxygen, like an ether or an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH₂ group.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's not it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a diene. But the IR doesn't match unless it's conjugated. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol. But again, the IR doesn't match unless it's an acid, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR signals. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ group next to an electronegative atom, like an O. Maybe an epoxide, but then again, that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Or maybe a ketone with two adjacent CH₂ groups.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group. So perhaps one of the bridgehead carbons has a carbonyl. But how?

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, maybe one of the bromines is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would require an SN2 substitution, which is unlikely at a bridgehead. Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs, but leads to a structure that can't form a double bond, so it forms a carbonyl via some other pathway.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the formation of a carboxylic acid, but that's unlikely with KOH as the reagent.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an enol, but that's just a guess.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another approach. What's product 2? It's formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, maybe in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone, so perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something similar. Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an ether. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the next steps. Product 2 is ozonolyzed to form product 3. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, so if product 2 has a double bond, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. So the NMR of product 3 would show signals corresponding to the carbonyl groups and any adjacent hydrogens.

Wait, but product 3's 1H NMR is the focus, particularly the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative atoms or in an aromatic ring. But in this case, maybe near a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me retrace. Product 1 is made from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is made by heating it with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another angle: the IR of product 1 shows a strong carbonyl, so product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe product 2 is an enol, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol (from substitution), but that doesn't fit the IR. So I'm back to thinking product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydration of a diol to form a ketone. But if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 would involve some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction.

Wait, let's think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a double bond would cleave it. If product 2 has a double bond, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. So product 3's structure would have carbonyls. The NMR would then show protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

Wait, but product 3's NMR is what's being asked, so perhaps the structure is such that a proton is split in a certain way.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me try to figure out each step again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Bromines at positions 1 and 3 on adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so positions 1 and 3 are across a face, perhaps? Or maybe adjacent. Wait, in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others. So 1 and 3 could be on adjacent carbons. If that's the case, elimination would form a double bond. But if it's a bridgehead, that's not possible.

Wait, let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, not bridgeheads, then elimination would form an alkene. But in adamantane, any double bond would be very strained, but perhaps in a way that the molecule can accommodate it. Alternatively, the elimination might not be feasible, leading to another reaction.

But the IR of product 1 shows a strong carbonyl, so perhaps elimination isn't the case. Then, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but I'm not seeing how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a ketone via a radical mechanism. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling. Wait, no, because coupling would require specific conditions.

Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic structure with a carbonyl. For example, if the elimination leads to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a diketone, which would make sense with the IR. But I'm not sure how that would happen from a dihalide.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of product 1. The NMR has four signals. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen. Let's say it's an ether, like OCH₂. The 10H in 2.41-2.23 ppm might be from several equivalent CH₂ groups adjacent to each other, perhaps in a ring structure. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a CH₂ near a carbonyl group.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's a structure where a CH₂ group is near the carbonyl. Maybe something like adamantane with a ketone group and some adjacent CH₂ groups.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is adamantane-1,3-dione. So, a diketone. But would that fit the NMR data?

If the structure is a diketone, then the carbonyls are at positions 1 and 3. The adjacent CH₂ groups would be around 2.4 ppm perhaps. Let me think about the NMR.

The 4.79 ppm (2H) would be something else. Maybe an -OCH₂- group. But wait, if product 1 is a diketone, perhaps it's formed via some kind of cyclization. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone. For example, cyclohexanone derivatives. But given the starting material is adamantane, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexenone or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkyl bromide, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. Heating with KOH in excess. That might be a situation for the formation of an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen condensation, but that requires esters.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol that then forms a ketone via oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about product 2. It's formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is Al(OiPr)₃, which is a Lewis acid. It's often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions, as a catalyst for acylation or alkylation.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or an enolate. Or maybe product 2 is an alkylation product.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone and product 2 is formed with a Lewis acid, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation. Alternatively, since product 2 is being subjected to ozonolysis, which works on alkenes, product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 2 has a double bond. Therefore, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed by some kind of elimination.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl. Then, product 2 comes from product 1 via some reaction. Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is a diene formed by ring-opening or some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is a diene formed by elimination of water. But then, product 1's IR would show O-H stretches, not a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is as follows: 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes elimination with KOH to form a diene, which is then something else. But that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diketone. Then, product 2 is an enol, perhaps, which could tautomerize.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis, would break into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but if product 2 is an enol ether (which is an alkene adjacent to an oxygen), ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups at the cleavage points.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. The number of carbonyl groups would depend on the structure of the double bond. For example, if product 2 has a double bond between two carbons each with two substituents, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have these carbonyl groups, and the NMR would reflect that.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would be near an electronegative atom, like a carbonyl.

So, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be deshielded and would show coupling with neighboring protons.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, so any protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be on each side of the original double bond.

So, perhaps product 3 has two carbonyl groups, and each has a CH₂ group attached.

Assuming that, the protons on these CH₂ groups would be adjacent to carbonyls. These protons would be deshielded and would split into certain coupling patterns.

Assuming that each CH₂ is adjacent to a carbonyl, and if the CH₂ is between two carbonyl groups (like in a diketone), the protons would each be adjacent to two different carbonyl groups. Wait, but in ozonolysis, each carbonyl is at the end. So, for a simple case, if the alkene is R-CH₂-CH₂-R, ozonolysis would break it into two R-CHO groups.

Wait, but more accurately, ozonolysis in reductive workup (like with dimethyl sulfide) would give aldehydes. So, if product 2 is an alkene like R-CH₂-CH₂-R', ozonolysis would give R-CHO and R'-CHO.

But the starting material is adamantane, so the product would be two carbonyl groups attached to adamantane moieties.

Wait, but let me think of the structure of product 2. If product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a diene, maybe product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enol). So, when ozonolysis is done, the conjugated diene would break into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe product 2 is an enone, like a conjugated dienone. Ozonolysis of an enone would give two ketone groups.

Okay, perhaps product 3 has two ketone groups. Then, the NMR would show the protons adjacent to these ketones.

But in that case, each CH₂ adjacent to a ketone would have protons that are deshielded. The coupling pattern would depend on how many neighboring protons each has and their arrangement.

Wait, let me imagine product 3 has a structure like (CH₂)₂C=O. So, each of the CH₂ groups would have two protons each.

The protons on each CH₂ would be next to a ketone. Each CH₂ would have two protons, and if they're adjacent to another CH₂ group, which is also adjacent to a ketone, then each proton on the first CH₂ would be split by the protons on the adjacent CH₂.

So, for each proton on the first CH₂, there's two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH₂, so each would be a triplet. But wait, each CH₂ has two protons, and they're next to another CH₂ with two protons as well. So for each proton, it's coupling with two equivalent protons, which would result in a triplet.

Alternatively, if the two CH₂ groups are each adjacent to a ketone and in a certain configuration, maybe the coupling is more complex.

Wait, but let me think of the structure. Suppose product 3 has a structure where each carbonyl is connected to a CH₂ group. So, maybe something like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a diene (like 1,3-diene) would give two carbonyl groups. So, for example, if product 2 was (CH₂)₂CH-CH₂(CH₂)₂, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclic diene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups at opposite ends.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 2 is such that each end is a CH₂ group, so ozonolysis would cleave into two CH₂ groups, each attached to a carbonyl.

In that scenario, the CH₂ groups would each have two protons, and each of these protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl. The neighboring CH₂ would have two protons as well, so each proton would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

But wait, each CH₂ group's protons would be next to another CH₂ group with two protons. So each proton would have two neighboring protons, resulting in a triplet.

So the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) would be a triplet.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is triplet, option B is triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, but if each of the CH₂ groups is split by two neighboring protons, but perhaps there's also coupling with another set of protons, making it a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH₂ is between two carbonyls, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more complex. Suppose each CH₂ is adjacent to a carbonyl and also to another CH₂ group that's further away. So each CH₂'s protons couple with two from one adjacent group and perhaps one or two from another group.

Alternatively, maybe the CH₂ groups are in a trans configuration, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident, but from the options given, the most likely coupling pattern for the adjacent protons would be a triplet. So the answer might be A) triplet.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If each CH₂ group has two protons, and each is adjacent to another CH₂ with two protons, then each proton on the first CH₂ would see two protons on the adjacent CH₂. So each would split into a triplet. So the NMR peak for those protons would be a triplet.

So the most deshielded protons (adjacent to carbonyls) would show as triplet.

So the answer is A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a substitution or elimination reaction. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group, specifically a ketone. The NMR data for product 1 includes signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H), suggesting a structure with a ketone group and adjacent CH₂ groups.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**: Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely forms product 2, which contains a double bond (alkene). This is inferred because ozonolysis in the next step targets alkenes.

3. **Ozonolysis and workup**: Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **NMR analysis of product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen couples with two equivalent hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A
