Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Let me try to work through this step by step.

So, the scenario is that a small peptidic compound has been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum is mostly as expected, except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts, equal integrals (so together they make 1H, which is right), and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So, same molecular weight, but two peaks.

Hmm. Let me think about each part.

First, the NMR issue: same alpha-proton showing two peaks. Normally, each proton in a certain environment should show a single peak. But if the shifts are similar, maybe it's an issue with the structure.

Wait, but the integrals add up to 1H, so it's not a doublet from coupling. The question says to rule out spin-spin coupling, so maybe it's not that. Another possibility is that the proton is in a different environment in different molecules, but that seems odd.

Looking at the options. Option B says enantiomers. If the compound is a mixture of enantiomers, that would cause a split in the NMR. But wait, in 1H NMR, enantiomers are identical because the environment is the same. So their NMR spectra would be identical, right? Unless it's a chiral shift reagent, but that's not the case here. So NMR-wise, enantiomers wouldn't split the peaks. So probably, option B isn't the answer.

Option D is diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so in NMR, they would show different peaks. But in this case, the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton. Wait, maybe if there's a diastereomer, the alpha proton is in a different environment in each, so why are the shifts similar? Or perhaps the diastereomers are in a certain configuration that affects the NMR.

Wait, in diastereomers, some protons can have different shifts, others might be the same. But in this question, it's the same alpha proton. So what if the diastereomers have that alpha proton in the same environment, but others differ? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's about the coupling in the NMR. Wait, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin. So perhaps it's not about coupling but something else.

Option C is 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe during the formation of an amide, a double bond is formed, and perhaps some coupling occurs, leading to two different products. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a racemization issue?

Wait, another angle: when you have diastereomers, they would have different physical properties. But in this case, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So same molecular weight, but different structures? No, same mass so same molecular formula, but different structures. So it's either enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, enantiomers have same molecular weight, same retention time if the column is achiral. But in LC, if it's a chiral column, enantiomers would separate. But the question says the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with same mass. So maybe the LC is achiral. So if the sample is a racemic mixture, the LC wouldn't separate them unless the column is chiral. So if it's a racemic mixture, and the LC column isn't chiral, they would elute together, so one peak. But here, two peaks of same mass. So maybe it's not enantiomers.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. Same mass. So same molecular formula. But two different compounds. What else could cause that?

Wait, the NMR shows a doublet for the same proton. So maybe the molecule is a diastereomer with that proton in a similar environment. Alternatively, could it be due to some impurity? Like a byproduct.

Option A is the compound is contaminated with a precursor. So the LC-MS would show the main product and the precursor. The precursor would have a lower molecular weight. But the question says both have the same mass. So same molecular weight as the expected product. So that's not it. So option A is probably not correct.

Another thought: if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, they would have the same molecular weight but different physical properties. So in LC, they might elute at different times (two peaks). In NMR, each diastereomer would have their own set of protons.

But the question says that for the alpha-proton, there are two peaks. If the diastereomers have the same environment for that proton, perhaps the shifts would be similar. But why would they have the same shift? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the compound has an amide bond that's not formed correctly. Maybe an isomerization occurred during the reaction. For example, if the amide is formed in two different ways, creating two different diastereomers.

Wait, the question mentions an amide-bond forming reaction. So option C is about 'double coupling' during this process. I'm not sure what that term means exactly. Maybe it's when two different products form, perhaps a cis and trans amide, but wait, amide bonds are typically trans. Hmm.

Another thought: maybe the issue is with the stereochemistry at the alpha carbon. If the alpha carbon has two different configurations, then the molecule would have diastereomers. So that would lead to two different NMR signals for the same proton if the environment is different enough, but in this case, the shifts are similar. Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomers have the same alpha-proton environment, so their NMR would look the same. But that doesn't explain the two peaks.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the synthesis, leading to a mixture of diastereomers with the same alpha-proton shift but different elsewhere. But then why would the same alpha-proton split into two?

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the coupling during NMR. But the question says coupling is ruled out.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound has formed a dimer. But that would have a different molecular weight, so the LC-MS would show a higher mass. Doesn't fit.

Wait, the question states that the 1H NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton, but the integral sums to 1H. So each peak is integrating to about 0.5H. So it's not a doublet (which would have two peaks each integrating to 1H), but two separate peaks adding to 1H.

In that case, maybe it's a diastereomeric mixture where the alpha-proton is in the same environment in both diastereomers, but perhaps the coupling partners have changed? Or maybe it's due to some other structural difference that doesn't affect the alpha-proton's shift much.

Wait, but diastereomers would have different NMR shifts for protons in different environments. So if the alpha-proton is in the same environment, the shifts would be the same, leading to a single peak. But in this case, there are two peaks. Hmm, maybe it's a different issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the stereochemistry of the amide bond. But amide bonds are typically formed as trans, so that's not causing a diastereomer.

Wait, the problem says it's a peptidic compound, so it's a peptide. So perhaps the issue is with the synthesis of the peptide bond. Maybe during the synthesis, some of the bonds formed as D and some as L configurations, leading to diastereomers. Wait, no, that's enantiomers if all are opposite. Or maybe a single amino acid is in a different configuration, leading to a diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR is seeing a mixture of two diastereomers, each contributing their own peak for the alpha proton. So each diastereomer's alpha proton might have a slightly different shift, leading to two peaks. But why would the shifts be similar? Maybe the environment isn't too different. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the molecule exists as a mixture of two diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons, but perhaps the alpha-proton is in a similar environment in both, hence similar shifts. But why would that cause two peaks? Because each diastereomer contributes a peak. So in the NMR, each would show a peak for their respective alpha-proton. But the integration would sum to 2H if each had 1H. But in the question, the integration sums to 1H, so that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the molecule is a diastereomer mixture, but the integral is 1H because each diastereomer contributes 0.5H, so together 1H. How? Perhaps each diastereomer has a different number of alpha hydrogens, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the two diastereomers have the same number of alpha hydrogens, but they are in different environments, so each contributes a peak. But in this case, the integrals would sum to 2H, which doesn't match the question.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity and the same mass. So same molecular weight but different structures. So same molecular formula. So it's either enantiomers or diastereomers.

But earlier, I thought that for enantiomers, NMR wouldn't split. But wait, perhaps I was wrong. Because in some cases, like if there's a stereocenter that's not in the same environment, but that would cause splitting only if that particular proton is affected. Wait, no, enantiomers have the same NMR spectrum because the environments are mirror images.

So if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would not show two peaks for the same proton. So that rules out option B as the cause of the NMR issue.

So the other possibilities are diastereomers. So the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because it's a diastereomeric mixture.

But why would the same alpha-proton have two peaks? Maybe the diastereomers have that proton in slightly different environments, leading to two peaks with similar shifts.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the diastereomers have the same number of alpha protons, but with different coupling constants or something. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so that's not it.

Alternatively, could the diastereomers have different numbers of neighboring protons, leading to different splitting? If each diastereomer's alpha proton has a different coupling, but the question says you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation. So that's not it.

Wait, but the question says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So the two peaks are not due to splitting from neighboring protons. So it's not a doublet that arises from coupling to another proton.

So, possibly, the two peaks are due to two different molecules, not due to coupling.

Wait, the two peaks in the NMR could be from two different diastereomers, each contributing a peak for the same alpha-proton. So each diastereomer's alpha proton is in a slightly different environment, hence two peaks. But why would the shifts be similar?

Well, diastereomers can have similar but distinct shifts. So maybe the alpha proton in each is in a similar environment but not identical, causing two peaks with similar shifts.

So, in that case, the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton, each from a different diastereomer. But why would the integrals add up to 1H? Because each diastereomer contributes 0.5H? But that doesn't make sense because each diastereomer would have the same number of protons. Unless each diastereomer has only 0.5H of alpha proton, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers have the same number of alpha hydrogens, but each has a different splitting due to something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the molecule is a mixture of two diastereomers with the same number of alpha hydrogens. So each contributes a peak. So the total integral would be 2H if each diastereomer has 1H. But the question says the integral is 1H, so that can't be.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me think about the options again.

Option D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

Option C: 'double coupling' during amide bond formation.

Wait, when forming an amide bond, perhaps a double bond forms and leads to some coupling. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, during an amide bond formation, perhaps two different stereoisomers are formed. For example, if the reaction leads to a mixture of R and S configurations at a certain center, which would make diastereomers if other centers are present.

Wait, but if only one stereocenter is formed, then R and S would be enantiomers, not diastereomers. So unless there are other stereocenters, it's enantiomers.

But if the peptide has multiple stereocenters, then a change in one could lead to diastereomers. So perhaps the NMR is showing two peaks because the alpha hydrogen is in a different environment due to the different stereoisomers.

But in that case, the two peaks would each integrate to 1H, not adding up to 1H.

Wait, maybe the molecule has two alpha protons, but the question says it's the same alpha-proton. So, each peak is 0.5H, but that doesn't make sense because each should have the same number.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the LC-MS part again.

The LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So same molecular weight. So same molecular formula. So same structure except for something. What else could cause the same mass but different structures?

Wait, maybe it's a case of tautomerism. But tautomers usually have the same molecular formula but different structures, but the mass would be the same. But then, the NMR would show different peaks based on the tautomer. But the question says only the alpha-proton is showing two peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the stereochemistry. So either enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, if the problem were enantiomers, the NMR would not split. So that's ruled out for the NMR issue.

So, the problem must be diastereomers. So, the NMR shows two peaks because there are two diastereomers, each with their own alpha-proton environment leading to two peaks.

But earlier, I thought the integrals don't add up. But maybe the diastereomers have the same number of alpha protons, so each contributes 1H, but their signals are overlapping or something. But the question says the integrals are roughly equal and sum to 1H. So maybe each diastereomer contributes 0.5H. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers have the same number of alpha protons, so each contributes a peak. So for each diastereomer, the alpha-proton would have a peak. So for two diastereomers, two peaks. Each peak would integrate to the number of protons in each structure. But if each diastereomer has the same number, say two alpha protons, but that's not the case in the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the two diastereomers each have one alpha proton, but their shifts are similar. So in the NMR, two peaks each integrating to 1H, but the question says they sum to 1H. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, maybe each diastereomer has one alpha proton, but their shifts are similar. So in the NMR, two separate peaks, each integrating to 1H. But the question says they sum to 1H, meaning each is 0.5H. That doesn't add up because each diastereomer should have the same number of protons.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers each have the same number of alpha protons, but their environments cause the same alpha proton to split into two peaks. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is not with the diastereomers but with some other factor. Let me think about option C again. 'Double coupling' during amide-bond formation.

Double coupling might refer to a situation where a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out.

Alternatively, maybe the amide formation leads to some kind of isomerism, like both amide and something else. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a racemic mixture, but during the analysis, the NMR is run in a chiral environment, so the enantiomers are separated. But that would require a chiral column in LC, which isn't stated. The question says LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, which suggests same molecular weight but different structures.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the crude compound hasn't been purified, so it's a mixture of the desired product and a byproduct with the same molecular weight. But that would require the byproduct to have the same molecular weight, which is possible but why would the NMR only show the alpha-proton as duplicated?

Hmm, perhaps the byproduct is a diastereomer, so the LC-MS shows two peaks (product and diastereomer), and the NMR shows two peaks because each has the same alpha proton in similar environments.

But then, the diastereomers' alpha-proton would have different shifts but similar, so two peaks in NMR. But their integrals would each be 1H, but the question says the integrals add up to 1H. So that's a problem because if each peak is 1H, the total would be 2H.

Wait, but maybe the diastereomer has the same number of alpha protons but in a different environment. So each peak is 1H, but in the spectrum, they are overlapping or something. But the question says together they integrate to 1H, so each is 0.5H. That doesn't make sense because each diastereomer would have 1H of alpha proton, leading to 2H in total.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each option implies.

Option D: mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have same molecular weight, different physical properties. In NMR, each would show their own signals. So same alpha-proton in different environments would give two peaks. So in the NMR, the two diastereomers each contribute a peak for the same proton. So the integrals would be additive. But in the question, the integrals are each 0.5H, adding to 1H. So that would imply each diastereomer has 0.5H for that proton. Which doesn't make sense because each would have 1H.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomer has two alpha protons, but one is equivalent in each, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the issue could be that the two diastereomers have the same number of alpha protons, but each one's alpha proton integrates to 1H. So in the NMR, two peaks each integrating to 1H would sum to 2H, but the question says they sum to 1H. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers each have 0.5H of alpha proton. But that's impossible.

This is getting me nowhere. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) Contaminated with precursor: but same mass as expected, so no.

B) Enantiomers: same NMR, so NMR would not show two peaks. So probably not.

C) Double coupling during amide formation: Not sure. Maybe this leads to two products that are diastereomers.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers: leads to two peaks in LC-MS and two in NMR.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, same integral. So each peak is 0.5H. So in total, 1H. So each diastereomer contributes half a proton? That's impossible. So perhaps the problem isn't diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the synthesis, leading to a double coupling in the amide bond. So perhaps during the formation of the amide, two different products form, which are diastereomers. So each has a different structure, same molecular weight. So LC-MS shows two peaks. The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because each diastereomer has the same number of alpha protons but in different environments.

But the integral in NMR is 1H because each diastereomer contributes 0.5H. That doesn't make sense, unless each diastereomer has one alpha proton, but only half is present. That seems unlikely.

Wait, unless the diastereomers are in a 1:1 ratio, and each contributes 0.5H to the peak. But how? Each diastereomer would have its own set of alpha protons. So if it's a 1:1 ratio, each would have 1H. So the integral would sum to 2H.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the diastereomers have the same number of alpha protons but with different shifts. So the NMR would show two peaks each integrating to 1H, but that's 2H, which doesn't match the question. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the same alpha proton is split into two because of something else. Oh, wait, maybe it's an AB system. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, leading to two equivalent protons that are not split, but in this case, the two are not equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, leading to some symmetry. If the meso form is present, the NMR would show a single peak. But if a racemic mixture is present, it's more complicated.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the compound is a racemic mixture, so the NMR shows a single peak, but the LC-MS shows two peaks if the column is chiral. But the question says the NMR shows two peaks, which racemic mixture wouldn't cause.

So, back to the options. The only option that makes sense is D, but the integral issue confuses me. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the molecule is a mixture of diastereomers, and the same alpha proton is in a similar environment in each, leading to two peaks. But the integrals would each be 1H, which would sum to 2H, which doesn't match the question.

Wait, maybe the LC-MS part is showing two peaks because the diastereomers have the same mass but different retention times. So that's correct. For the NMR, perhaps each diastereomer has the same alpha proton but in the same environment, so why would the NMR show two peaks? Unless there's some other factor.

Wait, perhaps the two peaks in NMR are due to intermolecular coupling, but that's ruled out. Alternatively, the problem is that the same alpha proton is split into two due to some other effect, like the presence of two different diastereomers each causing a slight shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't about diastereomers but about some other form of isomerism.

Wait, another possibility: the compound has a dynamic process, like a ring opening and closing, causing the proton to appear as two peaks. But that's more about exchange processes, not the same as diastereomers.

Another thought: Maybe the problem is that the amide bond is not correctly formed, leading to a different structure that's not the desired product. But then, the LC-MS would have a lower mass for the byproduct, which it doesn't.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the answer. Based on the options, the most likely is D: mixture of diastereoisomers. Because the LC-MS shows two same mass compounds, which would be diastereomers. And the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, which could be due to each diastereomer having a different environment for that proton, leading to two peaks. The integral sums to 1H, which might imply that each diastereomer contributes 0.5H, but this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is correct because each diastereomer's peak is contributing 1H, but somehow in the spectrum, the peaks are overlapping or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are due to the same molecule being in two different conformations, but that typically doesn't split the NMR peaks.

Wait, another angle: the two peaks in NMR have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals. So each is about 0.5H. So perhaps each diastereomer has 0.5H alpha protons. But that doesn't make sense, as each diastereomer should have the same number.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the information, the most likely answer seems to be D: mixture of diastereoisomers. Because LC-MS shows two same mass peaks, which fits diastereomers, and the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, which can happen if each diastereomer has that proton in a similar but different environment.

So despite the confusion about the integrals, I think D is the answer.


The question involves analyzing a synthesized peptidic compound based on its 1H NMR and LC-MS data. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts, roughly equal integrals (summing to 1H), and a coupling pattern that rules out spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecular formula. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**
- A precursor would have a different molecular weight (lower than the product) and would appear as a separate peak in the LC-MS spectrum. However, the question specifies that both peaks in the LC-MS have the same mass, ruling out this option.

#### **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**
- Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have identical physical properties, including NMR spectra. Therefore, a racemic mixture of enantiomers would not produce two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton in the NMR spectrum. This option is inconsistent with the observed NMR data.

#### **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**
- The term "double coupling" is unclear in this context, but it likely refers to a reaction-related issue. However, the question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as an explanation for the duplicate peaks in the NMR spectrum. Additionally, this option does not adequately explain the two distinct peaks in the LC-MS spectrum.

#### **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**
- Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, meaning they have different physical properties and distinct NMR spectra. If the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, the LC-MS would show two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass (since they have the same molecular formula). In the NMR, the two diastereomers could cause the same alpha-proton to appear as two peaks due to differences in the local chemical environment for that proton in each diastereomer. The integrals of the two peaks summing to 1H could reflect the contribution of each diastereomer to the alpha-proton signal. This explanation aligns well with both the NMR and LC-MS data.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This accounts for the two distinct peaks in both the NMR and LC-MS analyses, as well as the observed chemical shifts and integrals.

**Answer: D**
