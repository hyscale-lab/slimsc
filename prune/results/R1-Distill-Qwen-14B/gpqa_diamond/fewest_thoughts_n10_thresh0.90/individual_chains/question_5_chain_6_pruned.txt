Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to possible states with definite values.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down as I understand:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so these are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yeah, that makes sense.

The operator P is presumably the total angular momentum operator or something similar. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, because in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are given by S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if P is a similar operator, maybe it's the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon, which is a type of lepton with spin 1/2.

The problem is asking for the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is in the x-z plane, which means it lies in a direction where the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane. So the direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that.

Wait, but the general unit vector in the x-z plane would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the direction is arbitrary in that plane.

The operator P along this direction would be P.n, which is the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So P.n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P.n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, because n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z= cosθ. So P.n = (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

And the eigenvalue equation is P.n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

So substituting the matrices into P.n:

P.n = (sinθ)(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Let me compute that matrix:

First term: sinθ*(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Second term: cosθ*(ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding them together:

Top-left element: (cosθ) * (ħ/2)
Top-right element: (sinθ) * (ħ/2)
Bottom-left element: (sinθ) * (ħ/2)
Bottom-right element: ( -cosθ ) * (ħ/2)

So the matrix P.n is (ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ]] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can factor out ħ/2 from both sides, so we get:

[[ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ]] * |ψ> = |ψ>

So we're looking for eigenvalues where the eigenvalue is 1, because when you have M |v> = λ |v>, and you multiply both sides by (ħ/2), you get (P.n)|v> = (ħ/2 λ) |v>. So the given eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so λ must be 1.

So the matrix equation is:

|cosθ   sinθ|   |a|   = 1 * |a|
|sinθ  -cosθ|   |b|          |b|

Which gives two equations:

1. cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2. sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let's write down both equations.

From equation 1:
cosθ a + sinθ b = a
=> a (cosθ - 1) + sinθ b = 0

Equation 2:
sinθ a - cosθ b = b
=> sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b
=> a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] * b

Wait, but what if sinθ is zero? That would be when θ is 0 or π. Let me think about that, but perhaps it's better to proceed with the equations.

Substituting a from equation 2 into equation 1.

From equation 2: a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] * b

Substitute into equation 1:

[ (cosθ +1) / sinθ * b ] * (cosθ -1) + sinθ * b = 0

Factor out b:

b [ (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1)/sinθ + sinθ ] = 0

Simplify the terms inside:

(cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) = cos²θ -1 = -(1 - cos²θ) = -sin²θ.

So:

b [ (-sin²θ)/sinθ + sinθ ] = 0
= b [ -sinθ + sinθ ] = 0
= b (0) = 0

This implies that the equation holds for any b, which is only possible if the coefficient is zero. But wait, the coefficient is zero, so the equation is satisfied for any a and b, but that's only when the determinant is zero. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the matrix equation (M - I) |v> = 0, where M is the matrix from P.n and I is the identity matrix.

So M - I is:

[ cosθ -1      sinθ        ]
[ sinθ       -cosθ -1 ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Compute the determinant:

( cosθ -1 ) * ( -cosθ -1 ) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0

Expand this:

= (-cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1*(cosθ -1) - sin²θ
Wait, alternatively:

= (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - sin²θ

Multiply out (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1):

= (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) - (1)(-cosθ) -1 * (-1)
= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ +1
= -cos²θ +1

So the determinant becomes (-cos²θ +1) - sin²θ = 0.

Wait, but -cos²θ +1 is sin²θ, so:

sin²θ - sin²θ = 0 → 0. So the determinant is zero, meaning that the matrix M - I is singular, so there's a non-trivial solution, as expected for an eigenvalue problem.

So the equations from (M - I) |v> = 0 are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Let me take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b

Wait, because if I solve for a:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), so:

a / b = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2)

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

Let me choose b to be some constant, say 1 for simplicity, then a = cot(theta/2)

So the eigenvector is proportional to (cot(theta/2), 1)

But wait, I should normalize it. The normalized eigenvector would have magnitude 1.

So the components are ( a, b ) = ( cot(theta/2), 1 )

But let me compute the normalization factor. The magnitude squared is |a|² + |b|² = cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2), since 1 + cot²x = csc²x.

So the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( csc²(theta/2) ) ) = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is:

( cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Simplify cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) ) * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but wait, I'm getting that. Let me double-check.

Wait, what's the eigenvector here? So from a = cot(theta/2) and b=1, then the vector is (cot(theta/2), 1). But when normalized, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, because:

a = cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)
b = 1

So the vector is ( cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 )

The magnitude squared is (cos^2 + sin^2)/(sin^2) ) → [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ] / sin^2(theta/2) ) → 1 / sin^2(theta/2)

So the norm is 1/sin(theta/2), so the normalized vector is multiplied by sin(theta/2), giving ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but wait a second. Because that's for the case when theta is not 0 or pi, where sin(theta) is non-zero. If theta is 0, then cos(theta) is 1, and the eigenvector might be different, but the problem states that n is along an arbitrary direction, so presumably theta is not 0 or pi, but general.

But looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this.

Wait, but let me check again. The eigenvector I found is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), but let me think about the eigenvalue equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Let me think about the case when theta is zero. Then the direction is along the +z direction. So the eigenstate should be the up state, which is (1, 0). Let me see what option C gives when theta is zero.

Option C: (cos(0/2), sin(0/2)) = (cos(0), sin(0)) = (1, 0), which is correct.

Another test case: theta = 180 degrees (pi radians), so direction is along -z. Then the eigenvalue should be +ħ/2, which should correspond to the down state (0,1) in the z basis. Let's see what option C gives: cos(pi/2) = 0, sin(pi/2)=1. So the vector is (0, 1), which is correct because P_z acting on (0,1) gives (-ħ/2)(0,1) which is -ħ/2, but wait, our eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, that's a problem. Did I get the sign wrong?

Wait, no. Wait because when theta is pi, let's substitute into the matrix P.n.

P.n = (sin(pi)) P_x + (cos(pi)) P_z.

Sin(pi) is 0, cos(pi) is -1, so P.n = (-1) * P_z.

So the matrix becomes (ħ/2) * [ [ -1, 0 ], [0, 1 ] ]

So the eigenvalue equation is ( -1 * P_z ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, the eigenvalues of P_z are ±ħ/2. So for the matrix [[-1, 0], [0,1]], the eigenvalues are -1 and +1, scaled by ħ/2.

So in this case, the eigenvalue is +1 * (ħ/2), so the eigenvector should be the state corresponding to eigenvalue +1 in the matrix [[-1,0],[0,1]], which is (0,1), as before.

But according to option C, when theta = pi, the vector is (cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2)) = (0,1), which is correct. So the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, matching the given condition.

So for theta = pi, it's correct. Similarly, for theta = 0, the vector is (1,0), which is correct.

Therefore, the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
Option B is a general spherical coordinate form, but the question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector, so option C is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the operator is P, which is along n. But the eigenvector I found is in the original basis (x, y, z), but the problem states that the components are given in the standard basis, which is the computational basis for the Pauli matrices.

So, the eigenvector components are in terms of the basis vectors |+x>, |+y>, |+z> etc. So the vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) is correct in this basis.

Wait, but option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is a two-component vector, which matches the problem's context of a 2x2 matrix operator.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac
