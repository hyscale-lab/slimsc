Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor for each state. Each state contributes e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT) and E is the energy of that state.

The spins here are S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy E is given by -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So I need to find all possible configurations of the spins and compute E for each, then sum e^(-βE) for all states.

Wait, but since each spin can be +1 or -1, each has two possibilities. So there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all.

Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. Let's denote each as (S1, S2, S3).

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

For each of these, I need to compute the energy E.

Let me compute each term step by step.

The energy E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute each of the three terms in the brackets.

Starting with state 1: all +1.

S1S2 = +1 * +1 = +1
S1S3 = +1 * +1 = +1
S2S3 = +1 * +1 = +1
So the sum is 3. E = -J * 3 = -3J.

State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no, wait: E is -J times the sum. So sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J * (-1) = J.

State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (-1), S1S3=+1, S2S3= (-1). Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

State 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1), S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (+1). Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

State 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (-1), S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (+1). Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

State 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1; S1S3= (-1)(-1)=+1; S2S3= (+1)(-1)= -1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (+1), S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (-1)(+1)= -1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E= J.

State 8: All -1.

S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3. E = -J *3 = -3J.

Wait, let me double-check some of these.

Wait for state 2: S3 is -1. S1S2 is +1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is +1*-1=-1. So sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So yes, E= J.

Similarly, state 4: S3=-1. S1S2 is -1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is (-1)(-1)=+1. So sum is -1-1+1 = -1. E= J.

So looking at all the states, I see that state 1 and state 8 have E=-3J. The sum in the brackets is +3 for state 1 and 3, so E is -3J.

All other states (2-7) have E = J.

Wait, no. Let me recount.

Wait state 8: all -1. Each S1S2 is (-1)(-1)=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3, so E = -J *3 = -3J.

So that's correct. So states 1 and 8 have E=-3J.

The rest of the 6 states (2-7) have E= J.

Wait, no. Wait, look again: in state 3, S3 is +1. S1=+1, S2=-1.

S1S2 is -1, S1S3 is +1, S2S3 is -1.

Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E= -J*(-1)= J. Correct.

So now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-β E}.

Each state contributes e^{-β E}.

Number of states with E=-3J: 2 (state 1 and 8). So each contributes e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3βJ}.

Number of states with E=J: 6. Each contributes e^{-β*J}.

So Z = 2 * e^{3βJ} + 6 * e^{-β J}.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see.

Option A: Z=2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}

No, because for E=-3J, the exponent is positive.

Option B: Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → this matches what I found.

Wait, but let me check the exponents correctly. Since E is -3J for those two states, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is -β E.

So -β*(-3J) = 3βJ.

Yes. So Z=2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{-β J}.

Looking at the options, option B says that.

Wait, but let me see the options again.

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e
