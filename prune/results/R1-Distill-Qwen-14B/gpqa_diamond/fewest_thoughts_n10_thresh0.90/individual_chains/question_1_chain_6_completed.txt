Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties, the peaks won't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required ΔE is the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe the larger uncertainty. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), because the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in the context of this question, each state has its own line width. So for state 1, the line width (full width at half maximum) is proportional to 1/τ1, and similarly for state 2.

So the two lines (from E1 and E2) must be spaced apart by more than the sum of their line widths to be distinguishable. Because if they're too close, their spectral lines might overlap and you can't tell them apart.

So the minimal energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of the line widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2) for the two states.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be greater than the maximum of the two line widths. Because if ΔE is larger than the maximum line width, then probably they are resolvable.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the formula again. The natural line width is given by the uncertainty principle. The energy uncertainty is approximately ħ/(τ), so the line width is about 2π times that, maybe, but perhaps the question is using a simplified version.

Wait, let's compute the uncertainties for each state.

First, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are given in eV, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV·seconds.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So ħ in eV·s would be ħ * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE = ħ/(2τ). But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, it's approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. Because maybe the 2 is negligible, or the exact factor isn't needed for the order of magnitude.

So for state 1, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

For state 2, τ2 = 1e-8 s. ΔE2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the line widths are about 6.6e-7 eV for E1 and 6.6e-8 eV for E2.

To resolve the two states, their energy difference ΔE must be greater than the sum of their line widths. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the lines would overlap.

So the minimal ΔE is approximately ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.6e-7 + 6.6e-8 = 7.26e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV: 0.001 n eV, way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV: even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV: 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV. That's larger than our sum of 7.26e-7 eV (which is about 0.726e-6 eV). Because 1e-4 is 100 times bigger than 1e-6. So 1e-4 is much larger than 7e-7, so that's sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV: 0.00000001 eV. That's about 0.01 times our ΔE1, and much less than the sum. So it's insufficient.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the numbers again. Because I might have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for τ = 1e-9 s, ΔE = ħ / τ = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ=1e-8 s: 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than that to be resolvable.

Now looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's much larger than 7.24e-7 (0.000000724 eV). So that would definitely be resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's much smaller than the required sum.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Is the energy difference required to be bigger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or is there another factor?

Hmm, in the context of energy resolution, the resolving power is often determined by the condition that the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties in each energy. Because each state's energy isn't precisely known; they have a spread around their mean value. So if the separation between the means is more than the sum of the spreads, they don't overlap.

So yes, the required ΔE should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So the smallest acceptable ΔE would be just above 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV (which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV), which is 100 times larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

So option C would be sufficient.

The other options are either too small.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E_i \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_i},
\]

where \( \tau_i \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For the two states:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be resolved.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than Option A and also insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 100 \times 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than the required energy difference and satisfies the condition for resolution.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy levels cannot be resolved.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it provides an energy difference sufficient to clearly distinguish the two states.
