Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components Px, Py, and Pz as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. So I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues are related to the components. But wait, this operator P is a vector operator, so it's like the components are part of a vector. Oh, right! The operator P along an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product of the vector operator with the direction vector n.

So P = n · (Px, Py, Pz). That is, P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. But in this case, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the y-component of n must be zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z). Wait, no, the direction is in x-z plane, so the angle θ is in the plane, which probably means that the direction vector can be expressed in spherical coordinates where the polar angle is θ and the azimuthal angle φ is zero. Or maybe θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. So n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ? Wait, no. Wait, usually in spherical coordinates, a point on the unit sphere is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). So direction in the x-z plane would mean that the angle φ could be zero or 180, depending on the direction. Because if n is in the x-z plane, then the y-component is zero, so φ is zero or π. So for simplicity, let's assume φ=0, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Wait, or maybe I should think of it as n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should just proceed symbolically.

So, the operator P is given by P = n_x Px + n_z Pz, since n_y is zero. So I can write P as a matrix because each component is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down each component:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2)* [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P = n_x Px + n_z Pz. Let's factor out ħ/2.

So,

P = (ħ/2) [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

The matrix is:

[ [n_z *1, n_x *1],
  [n_x *1, n_z*(-1)] ]

So,

P = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
              [n_x, -n_z ] ]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to solve the equation P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no. The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = λ |ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue. Here, λ is given as +ħ/2.

So, the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x ],
          [n_x, -n_z ] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, that can't be right because when I factor out (ħ/2), the equation would be:

[ [n_z, n_x ],
  [n_x, -n_z ] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x ],
  [n_x, -n_z ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Wait, let me write the matrix equation:

n_z a + n_x b = a

n_x a -n_z b = b

So, the equations are:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0   ...(1)

n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0   ...(2)

So, we have two equations.

I need to find a non-trivial solution (a and b not both zero). So the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Alternatively, we can set up a ratio.

From equation (1): (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b

Similarly, equation (2): n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b

Wait, but wait, since a cannot be expressed in two different ways unless the two expressions are equal.

So,

[ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ]

Multiply both sides by (n_z-1) n_x:

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1 )

Wait, (n_z +1)(n_z -1 ) is n_z^2 -1.

So,

- n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1 → n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

Which holds because n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So the two equations are consistent, and we can proceed.

So, a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b

Alternatively, a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express a in terms of b using one of the equations.

From equation (1):

a = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] b.

Wait, because (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b = [n_x/(1 -n_z) ] b.

So, a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b.

I'll substitute this into equation (2) to find a relation.

Equation (2): n_x a - (n_z +1) b =0.

Substitute a:

n_x [n_x/(1 -n_z) b ] - (n_z +1) b = 0.

Multiply through by (1 -n_z) to eliminate denominator:

n_x^2 b - (n_z +1)(1 -n_z) b =0.

Factor out b:

[ n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(1 -n_z) ] b = 0.

Since b can't be zero (unless a is zero, but then we have the trivial solution), the term in brackets must be zero.

Compute the term:

n_x^2 - [ (n_z +1)(1 - n_z) ]

= n_x^2 - [ (1)(1) - n_z^2 +1*(-n_z +n_z) ? Wait, let me compute (n_z +1)(1 -n_z) correctly.

(n_z +1)(1 -n_z) = 1*(1) +1*(-n_z) +n_z*(1) +n_z*(-n_z)
= 1 -n_z + n_z -n_z^2
= 1 - n_z^2.

So the term becomes:

n_x^2 - (1 -n_z^2) = n_x^2 +n_z^2 -1.

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1.

So this term is 1 -1 =0. So the equation holds, which makes sense because the system is consistent.

So, we have a relation between a and b. Let's write a in terms of b.

a = (n_x / (1 -n_z)) ) * b.

So, let's choose b as a parameter, say b=1, then a = n_x/(1-n_z).

Wait, but let's think about what n is. Since n is in the x-z plane, and a unit vector, n_z can be written as cosθ, perhaps, and n_x as sinθ if we consider θ as the angle from the z-axis. So, n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ. So, let me substitute that.

n_x = sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

So, a = (sinθ) / (1 - cosθ ) * b.

Hmm. Let me compute 1 - cosθ. Using the identity 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2).

And sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So, a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] * b

Simplify: [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2).

So, a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Wait, but that's if I take b as 1. Alternatively, you can write the ratio a/b = cot(θ/2).

So, the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = (cot(θ/2) * b, b).

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to express in terms of a normalized vector.

Wait, but let's think about the eigenvector in terms of spherical harmonics or spin-1/2 particles. The operator P is the spin operator, and the eigenstates are the eigenstates of the spin in the direction n. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates are usually written as |+> and |->.

Wait, for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates for spin in direction n are |↑n> and |↓n> with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

The general form for the eigenvector can be written as:

|↑n> = ( cosθ/2, e^{iφ} sinθ/2 )

Wait, but in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So, the phase factor e^{iφ} becomes 1. So the vector is ( cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ).

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalue we're considering is +ħ/2, so the spin is aligned with n.

So, the eigenvector should be ( cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ), right? Because when the spin is up along n, the state is |↑n> = ( cosθ/2, e^{iφ} sinθ/2 ), and with φ=0, it's (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Wait, but that's the case when n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The eigenvector for spin-up along direction n should be:

|↑n> = e^{-iφ/2} ( cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) )

But since in our case, n is in the x-z plane, φ=0. So this becomes:

e^{0} [ cos(θ/2), e^{0} sin(θ/2) ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which matches this.

Wait, but let me make sure. In the question, the eigenvector is for the operator P along n, which would be the spin component in that direction. So for spin-up, the state should be |↑n> as above.

But let's see the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is a spherical harmonic expression, but for spin-1/2, that's not the case. Spin-1/2 states are simpler.

Option D looks more complicated, involving square roots, perhaps from normalization.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the eigenvectors more carefully.

In the problem, the operator P is given by the components Px, Py, Pz as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, the operator P along n is n·P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

As earlier, we determined that the matrix for this operator is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

We need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Which gives:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is:

(n_z a + n_x b) = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

(n_x a -n_z b ) = b → n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

So, from the first equation: a = (n_x b)/(1 -n_z )

Substituting into the second equation:

n_x (n_x b/(1 -n_z )) ) = (n_z +1) b

Multiply both sides by (1 -n_z ):

n_x^2 b = (n_z+1)(1 -n_z ) b

But as before, (n_z +1)(1 -n_z ) = 1 -n_z^2 = n_x^2.

So,

n_x^2 b = n_x^2 b.

Which is always true, so we're free to choose b. Let's set b=1, then a = n_x/(1 -n_z )

Now, since n is a unit vector, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming n is at polar angle θ from the z-axis and φ=0.

So,

a = sinθ/(1 - cosθ )

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ]

= cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2 )

So, a = cot(theta/2), and b = 1.

So the eigenvector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But this is not normalized. So to normalize, let's compute the norm.

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

|a|^2 = cot^2(theta/2) = [cos^2(theta/2) ] / [ sin^2(theta/2) ]

|b|^2 = 1.

So,

norm squared = cos^2(theta/2)/ sin^2(theta/2) + 1 = [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ] / sin^2(theta/2) )

= [1 ] / sin^2(theta/2 )

So, the norm is 1/sin(theta/2 )

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] * sin(theta/2 )

Which is:

[ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) ) * sin(theta/2 ), 1 * sin(theta/2) ]

Simplify:

= [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin theta), which is for higher spins perhaps, but for spin-1/2, I think option C is correct.

Another option, option D has square roots and other factors, but I don't think they're necessary here.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Express the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]
where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$.

### Step 2: Solve for the eigenvector
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \, | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle
\]
Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
This gives the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \, b = 0 \tag{1}
\]
\[
\sin\theta \, a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0 \tag{2}
\]
From Equation (1), solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:
\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) \, b
\]
Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The norm of the eigenvector is:
\[
\| | \psi \rangle \|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = \cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \frac{\cos^2(\theta/2)}{\sin^2(\theta/2)} + 1 = \frac{1}{\sin^2(\theta/2)}
\]
The normalized eigenvector is:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \sin(\theta/2) \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ is incorrect as it does not depend on $\theta$ or $\phi$.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is incorrect because it corresponds to higher-spin systems, not spin-1/2.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector for spin-1/2.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ is incorrect as it introduces unnecessary normalization factors.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
