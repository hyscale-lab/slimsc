Alright, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, it's about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds. The examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically controlled, so the products are more stable.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different starting materials and conditions. I need to figure out each product based on the type of reaction.

Starting with reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. Let me draw the structures.

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have the structure (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Wait, no, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2? No, wait. Ethan-1-amine is CH2NH2CH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH3CH2NH2. But the 1,1-dimethoxy would be on the first carbon. So it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Wait, maybe it's (CH3O)2CH-NH2, but that's 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine. Let me think... The structure might be (CH3O)2CH-NH2. So a primary amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH2OH, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2? No, butenol structure. Let me think again. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2, but that can't be right because but-3-en means double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait. The formula is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is: the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol structure: positions 1, 2, 3,4. The double bond is between C3 and C4, and the -OH is on C2. So structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2. Hmm, perhaps better to write it as CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, but that would be but-2-en-3-ol. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me correct. The correct structure for but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3. Wait, no. Let me think. The butenol has four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C4, so the structure is CH2CH2(OH)CH2. But that doesn't make sense because but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. No, wait, that's but-2-en-3-ol. Wait, perhaps I should look up but-3-en-2-ol. Oh, right, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2CH2OH? No, but that would be but-1-en-4-ol. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3, but that's but-2-en-3-
