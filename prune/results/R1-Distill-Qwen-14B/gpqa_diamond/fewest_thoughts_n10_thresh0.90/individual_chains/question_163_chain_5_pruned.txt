Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong monobasic acid. The goal is to find out the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, I also need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A to D.

Alright, first, I think I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 is there. So, the mass is 0.1 grams. I remember that molar mass calculations are important here. Let me calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3.

Iron (Fe) has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1.008 g/mol. Fe(OH)3 has one Fe, three O, and three H. Wait, no, wait. Fe(OH)3 is Fe^3+ and three OH^- ions, right? So each OH- is O and H. So molar mass would be Fe + 3*(O + H) ?

So, Fe: 55.85, O: 3*16=48, H:3*1.008=3.024. Adding them up: 55.85 +48=103.85, plus 3.024 is 106.874 g/mol. So approximately 106.87 g/mol.

Now, the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 is mass divided by molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.000935 moles, or 9.35 x 10^-4 moles.

Next, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it's a weak base. When dissolved in a strong acid, like HCl (assuming the acid is HCl), it should react. The reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ ions.

So the moles of H+ needed are 3 times moles of Fe(OH)3. Let's calculate that. 3 * 9.35e-4 ≈ 0.002805 moles of H+.

The acid is monobasic and strong, so it will dissociate completely. Let's say the acid is HCl, but the type might not matter here as long as it's monobasic and strong.

The concentration of the acid is 0.1 M. So, Molarity = moles / volume (in liters). We need the volume (V) of acid that provides 0.002805 moles.

V = moles / Molarity = 0.002805 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02805 L, which is 28.05 cm³. So that's the minimum volume needed, right?

Wait, but the total volume is 100 cm³. Does the volume of the acid added affect the total volume? Hmm, because when you add 28 cm³ of acid to 100 cm³, does the total become 128? Or is 100 cm³ the final volume after adding the acid?

Wait, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So that suggests that the acid solution is made such that when added to the Fe(OH)3, the final solution's volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps the acid volume is calculated such that the total volume is 100 cm³. Or maybe it's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says: "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume." So the final solution is 100 cm³. So when you add the acid, which is a certain volume, and the Fe(OH)3, which I guess is a solid, the total is 100 cm³. So the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3, and the solution is diluted to 100 cm³.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased is a bit confusing
