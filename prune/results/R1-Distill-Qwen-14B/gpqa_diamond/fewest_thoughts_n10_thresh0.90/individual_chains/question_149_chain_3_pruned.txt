Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think it through step by step. 

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly okay, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what's expected. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. So, what's going on here?

Then there's the LC-MS part: when they run it at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So, same mass, but two different peaks. Hmm.

Alright, let's break this down. The NMR part first. So, same alpha-proton showing as two peaks. Since the integrals add up to 1H, it can't be a diastereomer issue because diastereomers would have multiple differences, but maybe more. Wait, no, diastereomers can have different chemical shifts. But in this case, the shifts are similar, so maybe not. Or perhaps it's about coupling.

Wait, the coupling is ruled out. So why else would there be two peaks for the same proton? I remember that in some cases, like when there's a molecule with a plane of symmetry, you might get equivalent protons that split into two due to some other effect. But wait, if it's the same alpha-proton, maybe it's about the configuration of the stereocenters around it.

Wait, another possibility: if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, but that might not directly affect the NMR. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a racemic mixture. Oh wait, but racemic mixtures are a pair of enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties except for how they rotate plane-polarized light, so their NMR spectra would be identical. So if the LC-MS shows two peaks but same mass, maybe it's a diastereomer instead of enantiomers.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. If the compound has more than one stereocenter, perhaps the alpha-proton is experiencing a different environment in some molecules. For example, if there's a double bond or some kind of stereochemistry that's causing the proton to split into two.

Wait, but the coupling is ruled out. So, maybe it's not about neighboring protons. What else? Maybe the compound is a dimer or something, but the MS would show a different mass. No, the mass is same, so the same molecular formula.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So, same molecular weight. But why two peaks? Could it be due to different conformations? But conformers usually don't split peaks in LC-MS, especially if they interconvert quickly. Unless it's a diastereomer mixture.

Wait, but diastereomers would show different retention times because their structures are different, leading to different physical properties. So if it's a racemic mixture, the LC-MS would show one peak because both enantiomers are identical in physical properties except for optical activity. Wait, but in the question, both peaks have the same mass. So, same molecular formula.

Wait, so the NMR shows two separate peaks for the same proton. So, perhaps the molecule has some kind of symmetry where the proton is split. Or maybe the molecule is in different tautomeric forms. But the question says the shifts are similar, so maybe it's not that.

Wait, another idea: maybe the molecule is a mixture of diastereomers. For example, if there are two stereocenters, and the crude product has both possibilities. So, in that case, each diastereomer would have different NMR shifts, but in this scenario, the shift is similar. Or wait, maybe the molecule is a pair of diastereomers where the alpha proton's environment is slightly different, leading to two peaks but same integral. And the LC-MS would separate them because diastereomers have different retention times.

Wait, but the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass and same intensity. So, same m/z. So, same molecular weight. So, the molecular formula is the same. But why two peaks? If the compound is a racemic mixture of enantiomers, the retention times might be different if the column is chiral, but if it's a regular HPLC column, the retention times would be same because enantiomers have same physical properties except for optical activity. Oh, but the question says they used elevated temperature. Hmm.

Wait, but in the NMR, if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same as a single peak because the two enantiomers would look identical in NMR. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So, that can't be it. So racemic mixture probably is not the answer because it wouldn't show two peaks in NMR.

Wait, so looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. That would likely show a different mass in LC-MS. So the two peaks would have different masses, but the question says same mass. So that's probably not it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. As I thought earlier, NMR would not show two peaks because the protons are same in both enantiomers. So this would not explain the NMR, but the LC-MS might show a single peak if the column isn't chiral, but in the question, it's two peaks. So I'm a bit confused here.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I think that refers to when a coupling reaction forms two bonds, but that's usually in DNA
