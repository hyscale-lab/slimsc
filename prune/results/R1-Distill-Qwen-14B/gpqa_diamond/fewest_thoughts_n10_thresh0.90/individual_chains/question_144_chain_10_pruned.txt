Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They’re made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance. Oh right, that's the average distance a particle travels before decaying.

The problem gives me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D, all with different exponents and values.

I think I remember that the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Or wait, maybe it's the lifetime multiplied by the speed and then the speed again? Or something like that. Oh right, the mean proper lifetime is τ, and the particle's speed is v. So the mean lifetime in the lab frame would be gamma multiplied by tau, but wait, no, that's the same as gamma * tau. But wait, particles moving at relativistic speeds would have their lifetimes dilated, so longer lifetimes. But yeah, the mean decay distance L is v times gamma tau.

But wait, another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime. I think Γ is the total decay width, which is equal to ħ / tau. So tau is ħ / Γ. But because Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units that include GeV·seconds or something. Hmm, I need to make sure the units work out.

Wait, let's think step by step. The mean proper lifetime tau is hbar divided by the width. Because the uncertainty principle says that ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for a resonance, the width is the uncertainty in energy, so the lifetime is approximately ħ / Γ. But I need to get the units right.

Right, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Its value is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·seconds. So let me write that down: ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau (proper lifetime) is ħ / Γ. Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.320 GeV. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s)
