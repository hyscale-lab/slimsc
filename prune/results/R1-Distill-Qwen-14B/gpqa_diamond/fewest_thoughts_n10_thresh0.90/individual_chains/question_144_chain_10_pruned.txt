Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: X is a meson resonance. What's the mean decay distance? I have some given values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in terms of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance of a particle is related to its lifetime. The formula must involve calculating the lifetime first, and then using the speed of the particle to find out how far it travels before decaying.

So, the mean lifetime τ is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, right? Or wait, the relation between the width and lifetime. Oh yes, the uncertainty principle says that Γ (the width) is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ, but wait, no, actually, it's Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So rearranging, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, no, wait. The natural line width comes from the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should be careful with units here. Let's make sure.

So, once I have the lifetime τ, the mean decay distance is the particle's speed multiplied by τ. Because the distance is v multiplied by the time. So, L = v * τ.

But wait, the particle is produced with some energy. So I need to find its velocity. The energy E is the total energy, which includes the rest mass. E = γ m c².

So, E is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So, I can find γ, which is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, units. Let me think about the units. Since E is given in GeV, m in GeV/c², so E = γ m c². So, solving for γ: γ = E / (m c²). But since m is in GeV/c², E is in GeV, the units would cancel out correctly.

So γ = E / m = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c²) * c²? Wait, wait, no. Wait, E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But since m is in GeV/c², E is in GeV, so:

E (GeV) = γ m (GeV/c²) * c² → so E= γ m. So, γ = E/(m) because m is in GeV/c² and E is GeV. So yeah, γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666... so that's 20/3.

Once I have γ, I can find the velocity. The Lorentz factor γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So rearranging, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

Wait, let me compute that. Since γ is large (like 6.666), 1/γ² is about 1/44.44, which is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 c. So roughly 0.99c? Hmm, but perhaps I can calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, for high γ, v is approximately c, but maybe in this problem, I can just take v ≈ c. But wait, perhaps I shouldn't approximate yet. Let me get the precise calculation.

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Given γ = 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈6.6667. So 1/γ² is (3/20)^2 = 9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let's calculate:

Well, sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, sqrt(0.9801) is 0.99. So 0.9775 is between 0.96 and 0.9801.

Let me compute it more accurately. Let me think: 0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.008 + (0.008)^2.

0.98² = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.008 = 0.01568.

0.008^2=0.000064.

Adding them: 0.9604 + 0.01568 = 0.97608 + 0.000064 = 0.976144.

But we have 0.9775. So 0.976144 is less than 0.9775. So 0.988^2=0.976144, which is 0.001356 less than 0.9775.

Let me try 0.9885:

0.9885^2 = ?

Let me compute:

(0.988 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.988² + 2*(0.988)*(0.0005) + (0.0005)^2.

0.988² is 0.976144 as before.

Plus 2*(0.988)*0.0005 = 0.000988.

Plus 0.00000025.

So total is 0.976144 + 0.000988 = 0.977132 + 0.00000025≈0.977132.

Still less than 0.9775. So difference is 0.9775 - 0.977132=0.000368.

Let me figure the next step. Let me try 0.9885 + delta, where delta is small.

Let me set x = 0.9885, x² = 0.977132. We need x² = 0.9775. The difference is 0.000368.

The derivative of x² is 2x, so the delta needed is approximately 0.000368/(2x) ≈ 0.000368/(2*0.9885) ≈ 0.000368/(1.977) ≈ 0.000186.

So x ≈ 0.9885 + 0.000186 ≈ 0.988686.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light. So approximately 0.989c.

Hmm, but perhaps for the sake of calculation, using v ≈ c is sufficient. Let me check the effect of using v =c. If v is 0.9887 c, then using c would overestimate the distance by about 1.13%, since 0.9887 is about 1.13% less than 1. So if I use v= c, the answer would be about 1.13% larger, which might affect the choice between options that are close.

But perhaps the problem expects us to take v ≈ c. Let me proceed with that and see.

So, back to the problem. Calculating the lifetime:

τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, units are important here. Planck constant ħ has units of J·s (joule-seconds), but in particle physics, we often use units like GeV·s or similar.

We need to compute ħ in units compatible with GeV. So, let's recall the conversion factors.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me confirm that. 1 eV is 1.602×10^-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718 ×10^-34 J·s.

Converting ħ to GeV·s: 1 J = 1/(1.602e-10) GeV. So 1 J·s = (1 GeV / 1.602e-10) )^{-1} GeV^{-1} s?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to remember that ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm. Wait, that's a common conversion factor. But perhaps I should just look up the value of ħ in GeV·s.

Alternatively, I remember that 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J, so 1 J = 1/(1.602e-10) GeV. So ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

Yes, I think that's correct. So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, to convert that to GeV, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ =0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait: 6.582 /0.32 = let me compute that accurately.

6.582 ÷ 0.32 = 6.582 * (100/32) )= 6.582 * (25/8) )= 6.582 * 3.125 = let's compute 6 *3.125=18.75, 0.582 *3.125 ≈1.81875. So total ≈ 20.56875.

So, τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0
