Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, I'm not sure if the radial velocities come into play here. Oh wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, but the peak wavelength (from blackbody radiation) is given by Wien's Law.

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Wien's Law states that λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So, if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the peak wavelength observed would be affected by the Doppler shift due to their velocities, right? Let me think. The star's own emission is at a certain wavelength, but if the star is moving towards or away from us, we observe a Doppler-shifted wavelength. So the observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted × sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), assuming v_r is much smaller than c, we can approximate it as λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted (1 + v_r/c). But wait, no, I think the Doppler formula for wavelength is λ = λ0 (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative towards). Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check: actually, the relativistic Doppler effect formula is λ = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but if the velocities are much smaller than the speed of light (which they are here, 700 km/s is about 0.0023c, since c is ~3e5 km/s), then the approximation λ ≈ λ0 (1 + v/c) is a good one.

So in the problem, the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. I think that refers to the observed wavelengths, which would be affected by their velocities. But the problem states these observed wavelengths are the same for both stars.

Wait, so the peak emission wavelengths (λ_max) for each star, as emitted by the star, would be different if their temperatures are different. But because of their velocities, their observed λ_max is the same.

Wait a minute, no. Because the stars' own temperatures could be different, but the observed λ_max (due to Doppler shift) are the same. But the problem says that the stars are radiating as black bodies, so their intrinsic λ_max (before considering Doppler) would be based on their own temperatures.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to model this.

Let me denote:

For each star, the intrinsic temperature is T_i, and the observed wavelength is λ_obs,i.

The problem says that the observed λ_max for Star_1 and Star_2 are the same. So λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

But the intrinsic λ_max is λ_em,i = b / T_i.

Then, considering Doppler shift, λ_obs,i = λ_em,i × (1 + v_i / c), assuming they are moving away (if v is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards). Wait, but the problem gives the radial velocities as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. So Star_1 is at rest relative to us, and Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.

So, for Star_1: v1 = 0. So λ_obs,1 = λ_em,1 × (1 + 0) = λ_em,1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: v2 = +700 km/s. So λ_obs,2 = λ_em,2 × (1 + v2/c). But the problem says λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

So:

λ_em,1 = λ_em,2 × (1 + v2/c).

But λ_em,1 = b / T1.

λ_em,2 = b / T2.

So,

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

Wait, but v2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute (1 + v2/c ). Let me compute v2 in terms of c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.002333.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T1 ≈ T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.997668.

So T1 is slightly less than T2.

Wait, but since Star_1 is at rest and Star_2 is moving away, Star_2 emits longer wavelengths, which are then observed at even longer wavelengths. So for their observed λ_max to be the same, Star_2 must have a higher temperature. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted λ_max would be shorter than the observed. So to have same observed λ_max as Star_1, Star_2 must have a higher T.

Wait, perhaps I should think it through more carefully.

Star_1: v_r1 = 0 → λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

Star_2: v_r2 = +700 km/s → so moving away; so λ
