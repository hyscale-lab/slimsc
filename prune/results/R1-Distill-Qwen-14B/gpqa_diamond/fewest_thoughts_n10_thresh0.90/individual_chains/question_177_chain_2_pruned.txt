Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The stars' brightest wavelengths are the same, which probably relates to their temperatures. Radial velocities are given—Star_1 is at 0 km/s and Star_2 at 700 km/s. The astronomers assume the stars are black bodies, so we'll need to use the black body radiation formulas.

The question asks by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are radiating as black bodies, this formula should apply here.

First, I need to find the luminosity ratio L1/L2. That would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴), because the 4πσ terms would cancel out when taking the ratio.

Wait, but I don't directly know the temperatures. However, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right! The peak wavelength λ_max is related to temperature by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K).

Since λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max = b / T → T = b / λ_max. So if λ_max is the same, T1 = T2. So the temperatures are equal.

Wait, is that correct? Because if both stars have the same λ_max, then yes, their T would be same. So T1 = T2.

But wait, what about Doppler shift? Oh right, because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which might affect the observed wavelength. But the problem says the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. So I think that's the observed wavelength. So the actual emitted wavelength would be different due to Doppler shift.

Hmm, this complicates things. So the star might emit at a certain λ, but due to their motion, the observed λ_max is shifted. But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both. So I need to account for the Doppler effect.

Wait, so the actual T of each star can be determined considering their velocities. Because the observed λ_max is the same, but the emitted λ_max would differ based on their velocities.

Wait, how does Doppler shift affect the observed wavelength? The Doppler effect formula for wavelength is: λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is
