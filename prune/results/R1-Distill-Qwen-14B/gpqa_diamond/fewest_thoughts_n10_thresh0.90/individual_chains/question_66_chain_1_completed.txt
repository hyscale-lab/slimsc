Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my SMEFT, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) interactions plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 8, etc. The key thing about these operators is that they must respect the same symmetries as the SM. 

Wait, the SM has certain symmetries. Let's think, the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and gauge symmetry. But what about other symmetries like CP or CPT? I think the SM doesn't necessarily respect CP symmetry. For example, in the electroweak theory, CP violation is present (like in the CKM matrix). So the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, but the SMEFT must maintain the same symmetry structure as the SM. Or does it?

Wait, no, I think SMEFT operators can include terms that break certain symmetries, but perhaps some symmetries must always be respected. Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it must respect the symmetries of the underlying theory. Oh wait, the underlying theory could be anything beyond the SM, but the SMEFT itself is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all the operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. That makes sense because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory.

So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must. What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes translations and Lorentz transformations. Well, since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it's also Poincare-invariant because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So I think Poincare (option 2) must be respected as well. So options 1 and 2 are in.

Now, what about CP and CPT? The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general, so SMEFT operators can have terms that violate CP. But wait, do all operators in SMEFT have to respect CPT symmetry? I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because in quantum field theory, Lorentz invariance implies CPT symmetry. So if the theory is Lorentz symmetric, then it must be CPT symmetric. So CPT (option 4) must be respected.

But what about CP symmetry (option 3)? Since the SM doesn't have to respect CP, SMEFT operators can violate CP. So the operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is out.

Wait, but wait. The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So operators can't violate Lorentz or Poincare, because that's the foundation. But operators can violate CP, but must respect CPT.

So the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2 → So only Lorentz and Poincare.

C) 1,2,4 → Includes CPT.

D) 1,3,4 → CP and CPT.

So the correct ones should be 1,2,4. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait another point. Are Poincare symmetry and Lorentz symmetry separate? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So if the theory is Poincare symmetric, it's automatically Lorentz symmetric. So the question is, do the operators have to respect both? Or is Poincare symmetry a broader statement.

But in the SMEFT, the operators are built from SM fields and must be Lorentz scalars. So the operators are Poincare-invariant, which includes being Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected are 1,2, and 4. So the correct answer is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) interactions along with higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. 

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars, meaning Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental requirement. This ensures the theory remains consistent under Lorentz transformations.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it is also Poincaré-invariant. Thus, Poincaré symmetry must be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not necessarily respect CP symmetry (e.g., CP violation in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry either.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: All Lorentz-invariant theories, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. This is a direct consequence of the principles of quantum field theory.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
