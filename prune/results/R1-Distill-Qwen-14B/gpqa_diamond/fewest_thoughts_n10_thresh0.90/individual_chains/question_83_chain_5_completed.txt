Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the volume doubles. I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes by the inverse of the volume ratio. So the initial concentration after dilution would be half of 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. But wait, does the dilution affect the amount of substance? Oh right, the moles stay the same because we're just adding more solvent. So moles = M * V. Let me calculate that.

Molarity is moles per liter. So, for acetic acid initially: 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let's tackle the equivalence point first because that's usually a key point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. 

So, the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, volume needed for equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. 

Wait, but when we reach equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to its conjugate base, acetate ions. So, the solution will contain sodium acetate. Since sodium comes from a strong base, it dissociates completely, so the acetate ions will hydrolyze in water.

The concentration of acetate ions will be moles / total volume. Moles of acetate are 0.001, and the total volume is the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the equivalence volume (10 cm³), which is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), so it will undergo hydrolysis: CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻.

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. Wait, let me calculate that precisely. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So, the Kb is 5.405e-10. Now, the initial concentration is 0.02 M. Since Kb is very small, the hydrolysis won't proceed much, and x will be negligible compared to 0.02. So, the approximation is valid.

Setting up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻] ≈ x^2 / 0.02

So, 5.405e-10 = x² / 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH⁻] = 1.04e-5 M. Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the Kb calculation. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume. Oh no, wait, the solution at equivalence is 40 + 10 =50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So moles of acetate is 0.001, so concentration is 0.02 M. That was correct.

Wait, but let me recalculate x. 5.405e-10 = x² /0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5. So pOH is about 4.98, pH≈9.02. Hmm, but none of the options have a pH near 9.02 at equivalence. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, none of these equivalence points are near 9. So maybe I messed up the approach.

Oh wait! Wait a minute. Wait, at equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate, a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution should be basic, pH >7. But all the options have equivalence pH's around 6.7-8.52, which are all below 7? That can't be right. Hmm, did I make a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. How is the equivalence point calculated? Oh, wait. Wait, when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic region. So the solution should have a pH >7. But in the options, the equivalence pH is between 6.73 to 8.52, which for some of them, like option A and D, are above 7. So maybe my initial calculation is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should have used a different approach. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate the concentration of acetate. At equivalence, the moles of acetate are 0.001, and the total volume is 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. So, using that, the hydrolysis would give [OH-] as about 1e-5, which is pOH about 5, pH 9. So the equivalence pH should be around 9, but all options have equivalence pH below 8.5 or so.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me double-check the initial steps.

Wait, initial 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid: 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, after adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.001 /0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. To reach equivalence, moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol, since 1:1. So volume of NaOH is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. Correct.

So, the total volume at equivalence is 40 + 10 =50 cm³. So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, but the pH comes out to around 9, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for pH at equivalence.

Wait, the pH at equivalence can be found using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw)

Wait, because for a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. The pH is given by (pKa + pKw - pKb) ??? No, wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the pH can be found by considering the hydrolysis reaction: CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻.

The Kb is Kw / Ka. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO-] ≈ x² / (0.02 - x) → but since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² =5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x²=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5 M. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98 → pH is 14 -4.98=9.02.

But none of the options have equivalence pH near 9. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step of dilution. Let me recheck. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid. Then adding 20 cm³ water. So, the total volume is 40 cm³. So, the concentration is (0.05 M *20 cm³) /40 cm³ =0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about 25% titration, not equivalence? Let me think about the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001 mol. So, moles at 25% titration: 0.001 * (1 - 0.25) =0.00075 mol. Moles of NaOH added: 0.25 * 0.001 =0.00025 mol.

So, the solution now has 0.00075 mol of CH3COOH and 0.00025 mol of CH3COO⁻ (from sodium acetate). The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but how much NaOH volume is 0.00025 moles at 0.1 M? Volume = moles / M = 0.00025 /0.1 =0.0025 L=2.5 cm³.

So total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 /0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO⁻] = 0.00025 /0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

At this point, it's a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(1.85e-5) → let's calculate that.

1.85e-5 → log(1.85)=0.267, so pKa=4.733. Approximately 4.73.

So, pH=4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) → Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 /0.017647 ≈0.333.

Log(0.333)= -0.477. So pH=4.73 -0.477≈4.253.

So, approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 for the first part. So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26.

Then, the equivalence point pH isn't matching any options. Hmm. But let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the hydrolysis calculation. Another approach: perhaps using the exact expression without approximation.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO⁻] =5.405e-10.

Let me let x be [OH-], so:

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x). Wait, but this would require solving a quadratic equation.

Wait, Kb is 5.405e-10, and 0.02 is much larger than x, so the approximation holds. So x is about 1.04e-5. So pH is 9.02. But options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles. Let me double-check:

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M *0.02 L=0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, all moles are converted to acetate: 0.001 mol, volume 50 cm³ → 0.02 M acetate. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the exact concentration. Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the dilution differently. Oh wait, wait another thing: perhaps the initial dilution isn't just adding 20 cm³ of water. Wait, the problem says we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial solution is not 0.025 M after dilution. Because when you mix 20 cm³ of acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is halved. So yes, 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the Kb calculation. Let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka=1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 /1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. So that's correct.

Hmm. So either the options are wrong, or my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the equivalence point is when all the H+ is neutralized, but when using the half-equivalence point or something else.

Wait, another idea: perhaps because the solution is at 25%, not equivalence, the calculation is correct for the first part, and perhaps the equivalence point is not in the options. But that can't be, as all options include an equivalence point.

Wait, looking at the options, the equivalence pH varies. Let me think: another approach to calculate equivalence pH.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the solution at equivalence is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution is basic. So pH should be >7. The options show that some equivalence points are above 7 (like A:8.52, D:6.92), others below.

Wait, my calculation says pH ~9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem was not about the equivalence point, but about another point. No, the question is about both 25% titration and equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume for equivalence point. Wait, when you titrate a 40 cm³ solution with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³. So the total volume is 40+10=50 cm³.

Wait, another approach: the solution after equivalence is 0.02 M acetate. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the acetate comes from a strong base, so it's a 0.02 M solution, and the pH is determined by acetate ion hydrolysis.

Maybe I should calculate the pH using the formula for a weak base:

[OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C)

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Still no match with the options.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I used the Kb from Kw and Ka, but maybe I should have used the correct approach for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. Let me think: when you have a salt like NaA, where A is the conjugate base of a weak acid HA, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of A⁻.

So, the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])

Wait, but in the solution at equivalence, all HA is converted to A⁻. So [HA] is zero? No, because in reality, some A⁻ will hydrolyze to form HA and OH⁻. So, perhaps I should model it as:

A⁻ + H2O ↔ HA + OH⁻.

The Kb expression is ( [HA][OH-] ) / [A⁻] = Kb.

Assuming x is the [OH-], then:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 >>x, so denominator ≈0.02.

So, x² ≈5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, again, same result. So why don't the options match?

Wait, looking back at the options, let's see option D: equivalence pH is 6.92.

Hmm, 6.92 is acidic, which is not possible for a solution of a conjugate base. So that can't be. So perhaps the problem is that the initial dilution was 20 cm³ of acetic acid plus 20 cm³ of NaOH? No, the problem says it's diluted with water, then titrated with NaOH.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me re-calculate that.

Wait, initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So, moles = 0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol.

Adding 20.00 cm³ of water → total volume 40 cm³. The new concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after adding NaOH, the solution is not just the acetate, but also taking into account the dilution from the added NaOH. But at equivalence, the volume is 40 +10=50 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using exact expressions.

Additionally, perhaps I should check my calculation of the 25% titration pH again.

At 25% titration: 25% of acetic acid has been neutralized. So, moles of acetic acid remaining = 0.001 * (1-0.25) =0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate formed =0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + volume of NaOH added (which is 2.5 cm³, as before).

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 /0.0425 ≈0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate:0.00025 /0.0425≈0.005882 M.

pKa=4.73.

So pH=4.73 + log(0.005882/0.017647) → which is log(0.3333)= -0.477 → pH=4.73-0.477=4.253 → approx 4.25.

Which matches option A's first value of 4.26.

So the first part is correct.

Now, perhaps the equivalence point in the options is miscalculated, but let's see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the initial solution. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is diluted with 20 cm³ of water, but the 20 cm³ of NaOH added for the 25% titration is not considered in the initial dilution. No, because the initial dilution is done before titration.

So, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, during titration, NaOH is added, increasing the total volume.

So, the equivalence point is at 40+10=50 cm³, 0.02 M acetate.

Hmm.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using the initial concentration before dilution. Wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M, but after dilution it's 0.025 M. So when calculating the equivalence point, perhaps I should have considered the initial 0.05 M solution.

Wait, no, because the dilution has already been done. So when titrating, it's the diluted solution that's being titrated.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial solution is 0.025 M, and when titrated, the moles are 0.025 M *0.04 L=0.001 mol. Then, the equivalence point with 0.1 M NaOH requires 10 cm³, as before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the NaOH solution may have a different volume when considering the pH.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that at equivalence, the solution isn't simply 0.02 M acetate, because maybe I should have considered the sodium ions as well, but sodium is a spectator ion and doesn't affect the pH. So that's not the issue.

Hmm. Given that the 25% titration pH is approx 4.25, which matches option A's first value. But the equivalence pH in option A is 8.52, which is less than 9, but perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is not about the equivalence point of the diluted solution but about the original solution. But that doesn't make sense because the original solution was diluted before titration.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH at equivalence using the initial concentration before dilution. Let me see.

If the problem was about the initial solution (20 cm³ 0.05 M) being titrated without dilution, the equivalence would be different.

But no, the question clearly says that the acetic acid solution is diluted with 20 cm³ of water before titration.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the equivalence point pH using a different approach.

Wait, another way to compute the equivalence point pH is using the formula for a weak acid titrated with a strong base. At equivalence, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. So, pH = pKa + pKw/2 → Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, I think I've done everything correctly, but perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at option D: 4.57 and 6.92.

Hmm, why would the equivalence pH be 6.92? That would imply that the solution is slightly acidic, which would be the case if the solution was a weak acid, not a conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression for Kb without approximation.

Let me set up the equation again:

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 - x).

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x^2 ≈5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x≈1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But what if x isn't negligible? Let's check:

If x is not small, then 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02 - x → then, 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x). Let's try solving this quadratic equation numerically.

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x) → x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 ) ] /2.

Calculate the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So sqrt(2.921e-19 +4.324e-11) = sqrt(4.324e-11) → because 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.921e-19.

sqrt(4.324e-11)= approx 6.577e-6.

So x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 + 6.577e-6 ] /2 → since the other root is negative, we take the positive one.

So numerator is approx 6.577e-6 -5.405e-10 ≈6.577e-6.

x≈6.577e-6 /2 ≈3.288e-6 → [OH-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

Oh! So about 8.51, which rounds to 8.52. So that matches option A's equivalence point of 8.52.

Wait, so I was making a mistake earlier by assuming x is negligible, but in reality, the approximation might not hold, and the exact solution gives a different pH.

Wait, how precise do I need to be? Let me calculate it more accurately.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 + 4*(1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = 4.324e-11 + 0.000000000002921 = approximately 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11)= sqrt(4.324)*1e-5.5 → sqrt(4.324)=2.08, so 2.08e-5.5 is 6.57e-6. So x= ( -5.405e-10 +6.57e-6 ) /2 ≈ (6.57e-6)/2=3.285e-6 → [OH-]=3.285e-6 → pOH=5.486 → pH=8.514.

So, pH is approximately 8.51, which rounds to 8.52. So the equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches option A.

So, putting it all together, the 25% titration pH is approximately 4.26, and the equivalence pH is 8.52. So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 \times (1 - 0.25) = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.001 \times 0.25 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is the initial 40.00 cm³ plus the 2.50 cm³ of NaOH added (since the moles of NaOH required for 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.00025 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.0176} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \([OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C}\), where \(C = 0.02 \, \text{M}\):

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{5.41 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation for \([OH^-]\) gives a slightly different result:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}, \quad x^2 + K_b x - K_b \cdot 0.02 = 0.
\]

Solving this yields:

\[
x \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}, \quad \text{pOH} \approx 5.486, \quad \text{pH} \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.
