Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography and interplanar distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system has all edges equal and all angles equal too. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. Right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by three vectors with equal lengths (a = b = c) and all angles are equal (α = β = γ). So in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 angstroms, which I think is the lattice parameter a. So a = 10 Å.

The problem is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance (d) is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula I remember is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2hk cos α) + (2hl cos β) + (2kl cos γ) )) ) or something like that. Wait, no, I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ). Wait, is that correct? Because I think for a cubic system, when all angles are 90 degrees, the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But here, the angles are 30 degrees, so it's more complicated.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) ), but wait, I'm not sure about the signs. Wait, no, the general formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ), but only when the lattice is orthorhombic? Or is it for any crystal system?

Wait, no. Wait, the correct formula for any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a b c (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) )^(-1/2) * something... Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, perhaps I should recall the Miller indices and the formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system.

Wait, another approach: for a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c, and α = β = γ, maybe the formula can be simplified. Let me think.

The general formula for d is:

d = (a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) )^(-1/2) ) * something? Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the formula again. Wait, no, I can't look it up; I have to think.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ) ) * (a² / (a²)) )? No, that can't be.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

But I'm not entirely certain. Oh wait, no, I think that's for a cubic system when angles are 90 degrees. Because in a cubic system, cos α, cos β, cos γ would all be zero, so the formula simplifies to d = a/sqrt(h² +k² + l²).

But in a general system, the formula is more complicated. Oh wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )^(-1/2) ) ?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the structure factor formula. Oh wait, perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a rhombohedral unit cell, which is a special case.

Wait, I found in my notes that for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance for plane (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos
