Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. It's a bit tricky, but I'll take it slowly.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and also releases B when G is heated. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Hmm, 277 K is around 4 degrees Celsius. Wait, what substances have a melting point near that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps something else. I'll keep that in mind.

Substance X uses a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X probably has an element with a common isotope and a heavier one. For instance, maybe something like Cl, which has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37.

The reaction with Y releases gas W, whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So W is a molecule where protons equal neutrons. Common possibilities are O2 (each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons?), wait no: O has atomic number 8, so each O atom has 8 protons. O2 molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in each O atom. So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So for O2, total protons are 16, total neutrons are 16. So that fits. Another possibility is H2O—no, wait, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 10, neutrons: 8. Not equal. So maybe O2 is a candidate.

Wait, another option: CO2. Let's see. Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons in its stable isotope. Oxygen has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So each CO2 molecule has C (6 p,6n), two O (each 8p,8n). So total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: 6 +8*2=22. So that's also equal. So CO2 could be W.

Alternatively, CH4: each C has 6 p, 6 n. H has 1p, 0n. So 6 + 4*1 =10 p; 6 + 0 =6n. Not equal. So that's out.

Wait, maybe O3? O has 8 p and 8 n. So O3 has 24 p and 24 n. That could work. Or maybe N2: each N has 7 p, 7 n. So N2 is 14 p and 14 n. That works too. So W could be O2, O3, N2, or CO2.

But let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps it's a double displacement reaction. For example, if X is NaOH (but wait, X has a heavier isotope, so maybe it's something like Cl? Like CaCl2? Or perhaps something else.)

Wait, the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm. Let me recall. A keto acid has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. For example, acetoacetic acid. When it reacts with something, say, a base, perhaps it forms a salt. But the product here has 2 O atoms. Wait, the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X has 2 O atoms. Wait, no, the product's formula is such that it has two O atoms in total? Or per molecule?

Wait, the product is the result of the reaction between X and a keto acid. Let's say the keto acid is RCOCH2COOH or something. If X is a base, perhaps, like NaOH, then the reaction would be a neutralization. So the product would be a sodium salt. But that might not have just two O's. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry—maybe it's a strong base like NaOH or KOH? Or maybe a Grignard reagent? No, Grignards are typically organometallics. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like H2SO4, a common reagent.

Wait, but X incorporates a heavier isotope. Let's think about possible elements with heavier isotopes. For example, Cl has Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if X is something like HCl, but when reacting, perhaps it's acting as an acid. But if it's a heavier isotope, maybe Chlorine is involved.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like H2O, but that's not likely since it wouldn't be a heavier isotope in its constituent elements. Wait, but wait, another element: Bromine has a heavier isotope. Or perhaps, more commonly in reagents, Chlorine is more common.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction with Y produces a gas W, which has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's suppose that W is CO2, which fits. Then, perhaps the reaction is something like a carbonate reacting with an acid. For example, CaCO3 + HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. But then Y would be HCl, X would be CaCO3? Or vice versa.

Wait, but the problem states that X is the one that incorporates a heavier isotope. Let's say X is CaCO3. Wait, but Ca is typically Ca-40. Then, heavier isotopes of Ca are less common. Alternatively, maybe the carbonate is not X. Alternatively, perhaps X is NaCl, but that's a guess.

Wait, perhaps X is something like AgNO3. Silver has a common isotope at Ag-107 and Ag-109. So if X is AgNO3, that would fit. Then, perhaps Y is NaCl. Wait, but AgNO3 and NaCl would react to form AgCl precipitate and NaNO3. The gas produced would be none. Hmm, that doesn't fit, as no gas is released in that reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is a heavier isotope-containing substance like CsCl. Then, when reacted with an acid, perhaps. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about the reaction. The reaction of X with Y produces gas W, which has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about the products. If W is CO2, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate (like Na2CO3) and an acid (like H2SO4). The reaction would produce CO2, water, and the corresponding sulfate. But that would make Y the acid, X the carbonate. Wait, but the problem says that X is the one with the heavier isotope.

Alternatively, if X is a chloride, maybe reacting with something else. For example, if X is MgCl2 and Y is NaOH, the reaction would produce Mg(OH)2 precipitate and NaCl. No gas though. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Let's think about B. What's a solid with a melting point around 4°C? Maybe ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) has a melting point around 334 K, which is about 60°C. Hmm, that's higher. Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe B is something like water ice? No, water freezes at 273 K, which is 0°C. The melting point is 273 K. Oh wait, the question says B's melting point is very close to 277 K, which is 4°C. Not exactly water. What about another substance? Maybe something like camphor? No, camphor has a higher melting point. Maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: when X reacts with Y, perhaps it's a reaction that produces a carbonate or bicarbonate. Then, when heated, the precipitate could be something that decomposes. For example, if the precipitate is something like calcium carbonate, heating it might not release much (but it would decompose into CaO and CO2, but that's a different reaction). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Let's think about the reaction producing a metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is an acid and X is a metal carbonate, the reaction could produce CO2 gas, water, and a salt. Alternatively, perhaps if X is a metal hydroxide and Y is an acid, the reaction could produce water and a salt, but not gas.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a decomposition. Or perhaps it's a reaction between a nitride and an acid, producing NH3 gas. But NH3 has 14 protons (1 from N, 3 from H?), wait no. N is 7 protons, H is 1 each. So NH3 has 10 protons (7 + 3), and 7 neutrons (N has 7-1=6? Wait, no. Wait, each H has 0 neutrons, N has 14 in NH3? Wait, no. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think about the gas W again. The molecule's protons equal neutrons. Let me list some possibilities.

Possible molecules where (number of protons) = (number of neutrons):

1. O2: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2: 16 protons, 16 neutrons → 16 = 16 → yes.
2. O3: 24 protons, 24 neutrons → yes.
3. N2: 14 protons, 14 neutrons → yes.
4. CO2: C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons; O has 8 each. So CO2: 6 + 8*2 =22 protons; 6 +8*2=22 neutrons → yes.
5. H2O: H2O has 2 H (1 each) and 1 O (8). So protons: 2 +8=10; neutrons: O has 8. So 10≠8 → no.
6. CH4: C (6p,6n) + 4 H (each 1p,0n). Protons:6+4=10; Neutrons:6 → 10≠6 → no.
7. NH3: N (7p,7n) + 3 H (each 1p, 0n). Protons:7+3=10; Neutrons:7 → no.
8. NO: N (7p,7n) + O (8p,8n). Protons:15; Neutrons:15 → 7+8=15 protons; 7+8=15 neutrons → yes. So NO is another possibility.
9. NO2: N (7p,7n) + 2 O (each 8p,8n). Protons:7 + 16 =23; Neutrons:7 + 16=23 → yes.

So possible W could be O2, O3, N2, CO2, NO, NO2, etc.

Now, what reaction produces these gases? Let's think about possible reactions.

If X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid (Y), then CO2 is released. So W would be CO2. Let's go with that for now.

So, X is a carbonate, perhaps. Then, Y is an acid. The reaction produces CO2 gas and a salt (the precipitate G). Wait, but why would a carbonate reacting with an acid produce a precipitate? Because the acid is perhaps not strong enough, or the product is insoluble. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite, reacting with an acid to produce SO2 gas. But SO2's molecule: S has 16 protons, 16 neutrons? Wait, S has 16 protons; but in SO2, each O has 8, so for SO2, protons:16 + 2*8 =32; neutrons: for S, it's 16-16=0? No, wait, no. Wait, each S atom has a certain number of neutrons. Let's see: S has atomic number 16, so protons 16. Common isotope is S-32 (16 protons, 16 neutrons). So in SO2, each O is 8p, 8n. So protons in SO2: 16 + 8*2=32. Neutrons: 16 (S) + 8*2 (O) =32. So yes, protons=neutrons → 32 each. So W could also be SO2.

Wait, but that's another possibility. So now, the reaction could be a sulfite reacting with an acid to produce SO2 gas.

But let's go back to the initial assumption that W is CO2.

So, if X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, the reaction produces CO2, H2O, and a salt (G). The precipitate G would be the salt formed if it's insoluble. But when heated, G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

Wait, maybe G is a carbonate salt that upon heating releases CO2. For example, if G is a metal carbonate, heating it would decompose into a metal oxide and CO2. But then B would be CO2, but that's the gas released earlier. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. If Y is a base, then the reaction could produce a precipitate of a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is a nitrate and Y is a salt solution that produces a hydroxide. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains two atoms of oxygen. Let me think about that. A keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). If X is a base, like NaOH, the reaction would be neutralization, producing a sodium salt, which would have more oxygen atoms. Wait, but the product has two O atoms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like a diethyl ether or something else, but that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe the product is a carboxylic acid derivative. Alternatively, perhaps a ketone is formed. Wait, no, the reaction is between a keto acid and X. If X is a base, perhaps the keto acid is deprotonated, but that would form a conjugate base, not a product with two O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reagent that adds to the keto group. For example, in the presence of a Grignard reagent, which adds to the carbonyl group. But X isn't an organometallic, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: the product has two O atoms. Maybe it's H2O? But that's unlikely as a reaction product unless it's a neutralization. Wait, but the product is from a keto acid and X. So perhaps it's forming a hemiacetal or something, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a molecule with two O atoms, such as O=C-O- something. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another angle. The problem says that X and especially its analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So X is a common reagent. Common reagents include NaOH, H2SO4, KMnO4, etc.

But X has a heavier isotope. Let's think about Cl again. So, perhaps X is HCl, which uses Cl-35 and Cl-37. But in that case, when HCl reacts with a carbonate, it would produce CO2, H2O, and the corresponding chloride.

Wait, but if X is HCl, and Y is Na2CO3, then the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + 2HCl → 2NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O.

So in this case, gas W is CO2, precipitate G is NaCl? Wait, no, NaCl is soluble. So no precipitate. So that can't be.

Hmm, so that reaction doesn't produce a precipitate. So perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is Ca(OH)2 and X is HCl, the reaction would be:

Ca(OH)2 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + 2H2O. No gas, so W isn't produced. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a sulfide. For example, if Y is FeS, and X is HCl, the reaction would produce H2S gas, but H2S has 2 H (2p) and 1 S (16p), so 18p, and 16n. Not equal.

Hmm, not matching W's condition.

Wait, if X is a peroxide, like H2O2. Then, reacting with another substance could produce O2 gas. So W would be O2. Let's see:

H2O2 (X) reacting with a metal (like K) would produce O2, K2O, and H2O. But K is a metal, so would form a precipitate? Not sure, but let's think.

Alternatively, if X is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), reacting with H2O would produce O2. So:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑.

In this case, O2 is the gas W. So the precipitate G would be NaOH, but NaOH is soluble in water. So no precipitate. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfate, and X is a carbonate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and an acid to produce CO2, but that doesn't produce a precipitate. Unless the acid is weak, and the salt is insoluble. For example, if X is CaCO3, Y is H3PO4. Then reaction would be:

CaCO3 + 2 H3PO4 → Ca(H2PO4)2 + CO2↑ + 2 H2O.

But Ca(H2PO4)2 is sparingly soluble? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces a metal hydroxide precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a nitrate and a sulfide, producing SO2 gas. For example, Cu(NO3)2 + Na2S → CuS↓ + 2 NaNO3. But that gives CuS as precipitate. Then, upon heating, what would happen? CuS heated would maybe decompose, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G is a metal sulfide, which when heated releases B. For instance, if B is SO2, but earlier I thought SO2 could be W. Hmm.

Wait, let's try to think about the information given. The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains two O atoms. Let's think about the possible products. For example, if X is a base and the keto acid reacts with it, the product could be a salt of the keto acid. But the salt would have more O atoms, not fewer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent. For example, in the presence of a keto acid, maybe a condensation reaction occurs, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the product is a molecule like H2O2. No, that's not formed from a keto acid and a base.

Another idea: if X is a metal, the reaction with a keto acid could produce a carboxylate salt and water. For example, if X is Mg metal, and the keto acid is acetoacetic acid, the reaction would produce Mg(OOCCH3COO)2 (or something like that) and H2. But that doesn't have only two O atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an oxidizing agent, causing the keto acid to lose oxygen. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that doesn't have two O atoms. Wait, no, it has two O in the COOH group. Hmm, but the product has two O atoms in total. So maybe the product is CO2? But that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the product is a molecule with two O atoms, like O2. But that's not likely from a keto acid and X.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is H2O, but that has two O atoms? No, H2O has one O atom. Wait, no, the molecule has two atoms of oxygen. So perhaps the product is O2, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diatomic molecule with two O atoms, like O2. But then, how would it form from a keto acid and X?

I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me try to proceed with the other parts and see if that helps.

So, when G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. Let's make a list of substances with melting points around there.

The melting point of 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm. What substances are solid at this point?

Ammonium nitrate has a melting point around 235 K, which is lower. Water's melting point is 273 K (0°C). Hmm, 277 K is 4°C. So maybe B is something like camphor? No, camphor's melting point is higher. Maybe something like sodium chloride? No, NaCl melts at about 801°C. Wait, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) melts at around 334 K (60°C). Not matching.

Wait, another thought: B might be an oxide. Maybe something like FeO? Not sure about the melting point.

Wait, another approach: the melting point of B is near 277 K, which is 4°C. So it's a solid at room temperature but starts to melt around 4°C. That makes me think of water, but water's melting point is 273 K. Oh, but the question says "very close to 277 K", which is a bit higher. Maybe the substance is a different form of water, like ice. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a salt that's not commonly known, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a solid carbon dioxide? No, CO2 is a gas at room temperature.

Another thought: maybe B is a solid ammonium carbonate. Wait, ammonium carbonate's melting point is about 235 K, which is lower than 277 K.

Alternatively, maybe B is something like sucrose, but I think its melting point is higher.

Hmm. I'm stuck here. Let me try to think about the elements in X.

The problem says that we need to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, considering all isotopes.

So, X has at least two elements. Let's say X is a compound.

Given that X is a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope, perhaps X is something like KMnO4, K2Cr2O7, H2SO4, or something else.

Wait, KMnO4's formula is K Mn O4. Mn has several isotopes, including Mn-55 (lighter) and Mn-55 is the most abundant. Wait, but some heavier ones like Mn-57? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that doesn't have a heavier isotope in its elements
