Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r squared. The field only has a radial component, and the task is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that divergence is a measure of the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. So, ∇·f would tell me how the field is spreading out from each point in space. But wait, how do I calculate the divergence of a vector field that's given in spherical coordinates?

The field f(r) has only the radial component, right? So in spherical coordinates, the vector field would be f(r) = [F_r(r), 0, 0], where F_r is 1/r². Oh wait, no. Wait, f(r) is the magnitude, so the radial component is F_r = 1/r². Because in spherical coordinates, the vector field components are F_r, F_θ, F_φ. But here, only F_r is non-zero, and it's equal to 1/r².

So to find the divergence, I think the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) * d(r² F_r)/dr. Because in spherical coordinates, ∇·f is (1/r²)[d(r² F_r)/dr] + ... (but the other terms are zero since F_θ and F_φ are zero here). So yeah, it's just the derivative part.

Let me plug in F_r = 1/r². So r squared times F_r is (r²)(1/r²) = 1. So then d/dr of 1 is zero. That means the divergence ∇·f is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin where r is zero.

Wait, but at r=0, the function isn't defined because 1/r² would blow up. So the divergence is zero for all r > 0, but what about at r=0? That's a point, but in the integral, maybe it's a
