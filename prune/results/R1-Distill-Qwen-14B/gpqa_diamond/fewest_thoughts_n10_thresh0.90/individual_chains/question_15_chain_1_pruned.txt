Okay, so I've got this question about transit detection probabilities for two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited observing time. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on a few factors. I think it has to do with the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Oh right, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But given that both planets have circular orbits detected via the RV method, maybe the inclination can be determined.

Wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass because we don't know the inclination. But for transit detection, the inclination has to be nearly 90 degrees (edge-on) for the planet to pass in front of the star. The probability of this happening depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

The formula for the transit probability is something like P = R_star / (a * (1 + sqrt(1 - (R_planet/R_star)^2)) ), where a is the semi-major axis. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor, but maybe I should think about the key variables.

Wait, another approach: the probability of transit is given by the formula P = (R_s / a) * (1 / (1 + (R_s / a)^0.5 )) or something like that. Or maybe more accurately, the transit probability is (R_s / a) * (something else). Hmm, perhaps I should recall that the geometric probability is roughly (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. I think the exact formula is (R* / a) * (1 / (1 + (R* / a)^(1/2))) ), but perhaps for small planets, this simplifies because R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so (R_planet/R_star)^2 is negligible. So maybe the probability is approximately (R_star/a) * (sqrt(1 - (some term)) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should look for factors that
