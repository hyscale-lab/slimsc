Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygens.

Hmm, let me break down each piece of information step by step.

Starting with the FTIR. The broad peak at around 3000 cm-1 suggests an -OH group or maybe an amine, but since the options include oxygen, likely an -OH. Oh wait, but wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Those are in the range for carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a ketone or aldehyde, maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be conjugated, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl or maybe an amide, but again, the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not that. So maybe two carbonyl groups? Wait, but the question says two other strong peaks—so perhaps one is a carbonyl and another could be something else. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring or something else. Or wait, maybe one of them is a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or something with a double bond nearby.

Wait, but the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means there's a double bond, like CH2=CH. So that supports the idea of a double bond in the structure.

So, putting that together: we have an -OH group (from the broad peak), a carbonyl group, and a double bond somewhere.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

Wait, C6H10O would have a degree of unsaturation. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each formula.

DoU is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero.

For option B: C6H10O: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two double bonds or rings. Since there's a double bond (vinyl H's), so maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option A: C6H12O2: (12 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. That might be one ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR has vinyl H's, so perhaps a double bond. But then the options have two O's. Hmm.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl: so maybe an ester group? Esters have both a carbonyl (around 1700) and an -O- group. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 but the O-H would be a broad peak. But in the options, the O count varies.

Wait, the FTIR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Two carbonyls? Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Maybe the 1650 is a conjugated double bond, like in an enone system. So maybe a carbonyl (1700) and an alpha, beta-unsaturated group (1650). That could fit with the vinyl H's in the NMR.

So for the IR, maybe it's a ketone and an ester? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl and an aromatic ring, but 1650 is more like conjugated C=C or an amide or something else.

Wait, if the compound has an ester group, that would account for the carbonyl at 1700. Esters have that. Also, esters have the structure R-O-CO-R. The O in the ester would contribute to the oxygen count.

Now, looking at the mass spec: a fragment at m/z=45. What's that? 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's ether). Or maybe it's an acetate group. Wait, the acetate ion is CH3COO- which has a mass of 60. Wait, but 45 is also the mass for CH2OH (which is 32? No). Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a ketene group? Not sure. Alternatively, think of common mass fragments. For example, the acetate group's loss would be something else. Another possibility is that the fragment at 45 is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91, so no. Wait, 45 is 27 (like a propyl fragment) plus 18? Not sure.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH3O group. Wait, CH3O is 31. Not 45. What's 45? Let me calculate. 45 is 9+36, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 45 is C3H7O? Wait, C3H7O would have a molecular weight of (3*12)+(7*1)+(16) = 36+7+16=59, which is not 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone fragment. For example, if the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, maybe the fragment on one side is CH2CH2... Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketone or something else.

Alternatively, 45 could be a CH3CO (acetone) group, but that's 58. Or wait, perhaps it's the (CH2)3O group, but that's 44. Close, but not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Or perhaps it's the loss of a larger fragment.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecular formula. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Looking at the molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2 -> Degree of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.
Option B: C6H10O -> DoU is (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.
Option C: C6H10O2 -> (14-10)/2=2, plus two O's.
Option D: C6H12O -> DoU is (14-12)/2=1.

So the IR suggests a carbonyl group, so that accounts for one DoU. If the compound has a carbonyl and a vinyl group (a double bond), that's two DoU. So for example, if the compound is something like a diethyl acetal or a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H's, which implies a double bond. So the IR's 1650 could be the conjugated carbonyl. So perhaps the molecule has a structure where a carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond, like an enone.

So looking at the options, which ones have the necessary number of DoU? Let's see.

If I have a carbonyl (DoU +1) and a double bond from the vinyl H's (DoU +1), that's two DoU. So the molecular formula must have at least two DoU.

Option B: C6H10O: DoU is 2. So that's possible. So that could be a molecule with a carbonyl and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2: DoU is 2. So same as B.

Option A: C6H12O2: DoU is 1. So maybe only a carbonyl but no double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so that needs a double bond. So A would have a DoU of 1, so maybe a ring instead.

Wait, but if the compound has a carbonyl and a ring, that would explain the IR and the DoU. But then the NMR would have no vinyl H's. So if the NMR shows vinyl H's, the molecule must have a double bond.

Therefore, option A (DoU 1) might not fit unless the ring is present. But wait, if the ring is present and the double bond is too, that would require higher DoU. So for option A, DoU is 1, which can only account for either a ring or a double bond. So if it has a double bond, that would use up the DoU, but then the ring would require more. So perhaps option A can't have both a ring and a double bond. So perhaps it can't have a double bond, which would mean the NMR shouldn't show vinyl H's. So this suggests that option A may not be the correct formula.

So the correct formula likely has two DoU: either two double bonds, a double bond and a ring, or two rings. But the vinyl H's indicate a double bond, so perhaps one DoU for the double bond and another for the carbonyl or ring.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: C6H10O. DoU 2. So possible to have a carbonyl (DoU +1) and a double bond (DoU +1). So that fits.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU 2. Could have a carbonyl (O in ester or ketone) and a double bond. Alternatively, maybe two carbonyl groups? Wait, if there were two carbonyls, that would require two DoU (each carbonyl is a double bond). So maybe C6H10O2 could have two carbonyl groups, which would explain the two IR peaks. Hmm.

Wait, the IR has two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated. So maybe the molecule has two carbonyl groups, like an ester and a ketone or something like that.

Wait, but let me think about the molecular formula. For option C: C6H10O2. If the formula has two carbonyl groups, each would contribute one DoU. So 2 DoU. Which matches the formula's DoU.

So, if the compound has two carbonyls, perhaps it's an ester with a ketone group. Or maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, it could be a structure like a beta-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups. For example, something like CH3COCH2COOCH2CH3 or similar. But wait, that would have more carbons. Alternatively, maybe something like methyl acetoacetate, which has two carbonyl groups. Let's see: its formula is C5H8O2. But our options are C6H10O2. Hmm, so maybe a similar structure but with an additional CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps a diester or something else with two carbonyls.

So, if the IR shows two carbonyl peaks, that would fit with option C.

But then the NMR shows vinyl H's. So the structure must have a double bond. So a double bond would account for another DoU, but option C's DoU is 2. Wait, but if there's a double bond and two carbonyls, that would be 3 DoU. But option C has only 2 DoU, so that can't be.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the 1650 peak isn't a carbonyl but something else, like conjugated double bonds.

Wait, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated C=C. So in that case, the molecule has a double bond (DoU +1), a carbonyl (DoU +1), and that's two DoU. Which would fit with option B (DoU 2) or C (DoU 2).

So, let's think about the possible structures. For example, a molecule with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a conjugated double bond. So perhaps something like cyclohexenone, but with more oxygens.

Wait, the FTIR peak at 3000 is broad, which indicates an -OH group. So the compound has an -OH. So, for example, a cyclic ester would have an ester group but no -OH. Alternatively, a diol with a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: a beta-diketone, but that would have two carbonyls, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like methyl acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. That would have a double bond (vinyl H's in NMR), a carbonyl (ester, IR at 1700), and a conjugated double bond (IR at 1650). Also, if the ester group is present, the oxygen count would be two. So the formula for that would be C4H6O2. But our options are C6H10O2, which is bigger. So perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, but in our case, the molecular formula needs to be C6H10O2 or C6H12O2, etc. So perhaps the structure is a substituted alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

Another possibility is that the molecule is a benzene ring with substituents, but since the options don't include a benzene ring (as in, the formula is C6H10O2, which for benzene would be C6H6O2, but with more H's, perhaps with substituents but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about the Mass Spec. The fragment at m/z 45. So if the molecular ion breaks down into a fragment with mass 45, what could that be?

45 is the molecular weight of:

- C3H7O (3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59? No, that's too high.)

Wait, 45 can be:

- 45 = 12*3 + 1*3 +16*0? No, that doesn't add up. Hmm.

Wait, 45 is 12*2 + 1*9 +16*0? (24 +9=33, no). Alternatively, 45 = 12 + 16*2 + 7? No, not adding up.

Wait, maybe it's a combination of atoms. For example, 45 = 12*1 + 16*1 + 16*1 +1*1? That's 12+16+16+1=45. So that's a fragment with C1O2H. But that's a bit unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the m/z 45. Let me think of possible ions. For example, the methyl group (CH3+) is 15. But 45 is three times that. So maybe it's (CH3)3 something? Not sure.

Alternatively, 45 could be the acetic acid ion, but that's 60. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecular ion loses a fragment of 107 (maybe the rest of the molecule) and the remaining is 45. So the molecular weight would be 45 + 107 = 152. So the molecular weight is 152. Let's check the formulas.

Option A: C6H12O2 has a molecular weight of (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. So no, not 152.

Option B: C6H10O: (6*12)+(10)+(16)=72+10+16=98. So 98 would be the molecular weight. 98-45=53. That doesn't make sense, since 53 isn't a common fragment.

Option C: C6H10O2: (6*12)+(10)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. 114-45=69. I'm not sure what fragment would correspond to 69. Maybe a butyl group? 69 is 69, which is C4H9, but that's 57. Hmm, not matching.

Option D: C6H12O: (6*12)+(12)+(16)=72+12+16=100. 100-45=55. Not a common fragment.

Wait, maybe the molecular weight is higher. Let me think again. If the fragment is 45, perhaps the molecular weight is higher than the options suggest, but the options given are possible. Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Another approach: think of common fragments. 45 is the mass of a CH3CO (acetone) group? No, acetone's formula is C3H6O. Molecular weight is (3*12)+(6)+(16)=36+6+16=58. So that's not 45.

Wait, what about the (CH2)3O group? That's 3*2 (CH2) * (each CH2 is 14, but wait, (CH2)3O is C3H6O: 3*12+6*1+16=36+6+16=58. No, same as above.

Hmm, not getting anywhere. Maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, but I'm not familiar enough.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 peak is from the loss of a functional group. For example, in an ester, losing the R-O- group as a fragment. Alternatively, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R', so maybe the loss of R' as a fragment. But not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let's look at the molecular formula options and see which one would give a fragment of 45 when broken down.

For option C: C6H10O2. Let's say it's an ester, so the structure might be R-O-CO-R'. When the ester breaks, maybe it cleaves between O and CO, giving an acid and an alcohol. The alcohol would be R-OH, and the acid would be R'-COOH. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps during the mass spec, the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment. For example, if the molecule has a methyl group attached to an oxygen, perhaps the methyl group is lost. But a methyl group is 15, not 45.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be a propyl group attached to something else. Propyl is 43 (C3H7). But 45 is 43+2, so maybe CH2CH2CH3O or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the loss of a larger group, like an ethyl group (29) and a CH2O group (30). 29+30=59, which is higher.

Hmm. Maybe the 45 is a secondary ion, like CH3CO (43) plus something. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ring opening. If the molecule is cyclic, the ring could break and form a fragment. But without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps I should focus more on the IR and NMR data and see which option fits best.

The IR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm-1, which is likely an -OH. So the compound must have an -OH group. So looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. So two oxygen atoms. Could have an -OH and another oxygen, like an ester group. Like a diol ester or something.

Option B: C6H10O. One oxygen. Could be an alcohol, but then how to explain the carbonyl?

Wait, if it's an alcohol with a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then the formula would be C6H10O. Let me check: a ketone has the formula CnH2nO. Wait, no, for a ketone, the general formula is CnH2nO. So for n=6, it would be C6H12O. But the option B is C6H10O, which is two H's less. So that can't be. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ketone with a double bond. Wait, but that would require more DoU. Let me think: if it's a cyclic ketone (so a ring, DoU +1) and a double bond (DoU +1), that's two DoU, which would fit option B (C6H10O). But then the IR would have a carbonyl at ~1700 and an aromatic ring (but 1650 isn't typical for a ring). Or perhaps the 1650 is from a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone.

So, for option B, the structure could be a cyclic alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Such as cyclohexenone? Wait, cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Its formula is C6H10O, which matches option B. And its IR would show a strong peak for the ketone (around 1700) and a conjugated double bond (around 1650). Also, if it's not cyclic, but a non-cyclic enone, that could fit.

But wait, cyclohexenone doesn't have an -OH group. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000 which is for -OH. So cyclohexenone is an option for structure, but it doesn't have an OH. So perhaps that's not the case.

So perhaps the compound is a dihydroxy ketone. Or maybe it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an allyl alcohol derivative with a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows vinyl protons. So the molecule has a double bond. The IR has a carbonyl and another peak at 1650. So perhaps the structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like an enone or an ester with a double bond.

So, considering that, and the presence of an -OH (from the IR), let's think of a structure that combines all these.

Let me think of option C: C6H10O2. If it's an ester with a conjugated double bond and an -OH group.

Wait, but an ester would have two oxygen atoms, which is option C's formula. So for example, imagine a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. But wait, that would have more than two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester with a double bond and an -OH. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule with a conjugated ester and an -OH group. For instance, something like HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH2. No, that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted acrylic acid ester. Like CH2=CHCOOOR, where R is something. But then where is the -OH?

Alternatively, maybe the -OH is part of the ester. For example, a hemiacetal structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a dihydroxy ester, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is a beta-keto ester. For example, CH3COCH2COOCH2CH3. But that's methyl acetoacetate, which is C5H8O2. So our formula is C6H10O2. So perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester with an -OH group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider each option's possible structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. Formula could be an ester with a ring. But then, would that have an -OH group? No, because esters don't have -OH. Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak, which suggests -OH. So, if it's an ester and a diol, but that would require more oxygens. So perhaps not.

Option B: C6H10O. If an -OH is present, and a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), but the DoU is two. So perhaps a cyclic structure with a double bond. For example, a cyclopropane with a double bond and a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. A possible structure is an ester with a double bond and an -OH group. Wait, but that would require three oxygen atoms unless the -OH is part of the ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a glycol ester, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diol with a carbonyl group. But that would require more than two oxygen atoms unless it's a hemiacetal or something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But then the oxygen count would be one. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the FTIR peak at 1700 is an ester or ketone. The peak at 1650 is a conjugated double bond. So, perhaps the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond. But where does the -OH come from?

Wait, maybe the -OH is part of a hydroxyl group attached to the ester. For example, an allyl alcohol ester or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a dihydroxy ester, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, to recap: the IR suggests an -OH (broad peak), a carbonyl (1700), and possibly a conjugated double bond (1650). The NMR has vinyl H's, so a double bond is present. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's see: it's likely to be an ester (two oxygen atoms) with a double bond and an -OH. Wait, but that would mean three oxygen atoms unless the -OH is part of the ester. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the -OH is part of a carboxylic acid. But then the ester wouldn't have that.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a beta-diketone with an -OH group. But that might not fit with the oxygen count.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal. But again, the oxygen count is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mass spec again. The fragment is at 45. What's a common fragment with that mass? Maybe the propyl group attached to oxygen? Wait, propyl is 43, but 45 would be something else.

Another approach: 45 is 45. Let me think of possible ions. 45 can be:

- C3H7O+ (3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59) No, that's 59.

- C2H11O+? No, that's 2*12 +11 +16=24+11+16=51.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a fragment from a ketone. For example, acetone (propan-2-one) has a molecular weight of 58. So if it loses a methyl group (15), the fragment would be 43, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage product. For example, if the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, the fragment on one side could be CH2CH2... but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a larger group. For example, the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and another part. So the molecular weight would be 45 + (M-45). But without knowing M, it's tricky.

Wait, looking back at the options, the only formulas with two oxygens are A and C. So the compound must have either one or two oxygen atoms.

Wait, the IR has two carbonyls or a carbonyl and something else. If it's two carbonyls, that would likely require two oxygens. So the formula would need two oxygens. So that would point to options A or C.

But earlier analysis suggests that option A has only one DoU, which might not accommodate a double bond and a carbonyl. So perhaps option C is more likely.

So, assuming the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which has two oxygens. The structure could be an ester with a conjugated double bond and an -OH group. Hmm, but how?

Wait, perhaps the structure is a dihydroxy ester. For example, something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, that's two carboxylic acids, which would have four oxygens.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a double bond and an -OH elsewhere. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. But that has three oxygens, which doesn't fit option C (two oxygens). So that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe the structure is an ester where the -OH is part of the ester oxygen. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a hemiketal or something similar. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: maybe the structure is a methoxy group and a carbonyl group. But then where's the -OH?

Alternatively, perhaps the -OH is part of a hydroxyl group attached to the carbonyl, making it a hydroxy ester. But that would require more oxygens.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option A: C6H12O2. If the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ring, then the DoU is 1 (from the ring) plus a carbonyl (another DoU), totaling two. But the formula only has one DoU. Wait, no. C6H12O2 would have DoU of 1. So a ring (DoU +1) and a carbonyl (DoU +1), that's two, but the formula only allows for one. So that wouldn't work.

Wait, but the formula's DoU is only 1, so it can't have two DoU. So if the structure has a ring and a carbonyl, that would require two DoU, which isn't allowed for option A.

Therefore, option A can't have both a ring and a carbonyl. So perhaps it has either a ring or a carbonyl. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so it must have that. So, option A can't have a ring because that would require two DoU, but the formula only allows one. So option A is likely not the correct answer.

So, considering that, options B and C are the possibilities, but B's formula has only one oxygen. So, unless the IR's broad peak is something else, like an amine, but the options don't have nitrogen.

Wait, back to the IR: the broad peak at 3000 cm-1 is very broad, which is typical for an -OH group. So the compound must have an -OH. So, the formula must have at least one oxygen, which all options except none have. Wait, all options have at least one O.

Wait, option B is C6H10O. So one oxygen. How can it have an -OH and a carbonyl group?

For option B, the structure could be a cyclic ketone with a double bond. But then the -OH would have to be elsewhere. But with one oxygen, it's either a ketone (C=O) and an -OH, which would require two oxygen atoms. So that can't be. So option B can't have both a carbonyl and an -OH because it only has one oxygen. So that's a problem.

Wait, that's a key point. So, if the compound has both a carbonyl group (which requires O) and an -OH group (which requires O), the total O must be at least two. So looking at the options:

Option A: O=2 → possible.
Option B: O=1 → cannot have both groups.
Option C: O=2 → possible.
Option D: O=1 → cannot have both groups.

So, that means options B and D can't be the correct answer because they only have one oxygen. Therefore, the correct answer must be either A or C.

Now, between A and C:

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU =1.

So, what structures fit DoU=1, with both a carbonyl and an -OH? Well, DoU=1 could be a ring with a carbonyl group. So, for example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a carbonyl. But then the IR would have a carbonyl peak but no -OH, unless there's another -OH group.

Wait, but a lactone is an ester, so it doesn't have an -OH. So how to have both a carbonyl and an -OH with DoU=1? Maybe a molecule with a ring and a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps a cyclic ketone with an -OH group. But cyclic ketones have a ring (DoU +1) and a ketone (DoU +1), which would require two DoU, but the formula only allows one. So that's not possible.

Another possibility for option A: a molecule with a carbonyl group and an -OH, but without a ring or double bond. Wait, but then the NMR shows vinyl H's, implying a double bond. So that's not possible.

Wait, so if the NMR shows vinyl H's, the structure must have a double bond, which requires DoU +1. But for option A, DoU is 1, so the only other possibility is a ring. So the molecule would have a ring (DoU +1) and a double bond (DoU +1), which would require DoU=2, but the formula only allows 1. So that's impossible. Therefore, option A can't have a double bond, which contradicts the NMR data. So option A is out.

That leaves option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2.

So, the structure must have two DoU. So, perhaps a carbonyl (DoU +1) and a double bond (DoU +1). So that fits. Now, how can it have an -OH group?

So, let's consider a structure with a carbonyl (like an ester), a double bond, and an -OH.

Wait, for example, a molecule with an ester group, a conjugated double bond, and an -OH. Like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. But that would have three oxygen atoms, which doesn't fit option C (two oxygens). So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a structure where the -OH is elsewhere, but with two oxygens total. Wait, but that's tricky.

Wait, perhaps it's a diol with an ester group. But that would require more oxygens.

Alternatively, maybe the -OH is part of the ester. For example, a hemiacetal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Since the IR shows a broad peak, likely -OH, and the other peaks are carbonyl and possibly a double bond, the structure could be a substituted acrylic acid. But acrylic acid is unsaturated and has a COOH group.

Wait, the formula for acrylic acid is C3H4O2. So if it's a larger molecule, perhaps a di-substituted acrylic acid ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an allyl vinyl ether or something similar.

Wait, perhaps it's a diester with a double bond and an -OH. But I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond and an -OH. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of the molecular formula again: C6H10O2. DoU=2.

So, the structure could be:

- A ring (DoU +1) and a carbonyl (DoU +1). So, a cyclic ketone. But then where's the -OH? Also, that would require three oxygens if it's a cyclic ketone with an -OH: the ring, the ketone, and the -OH. But the formula has only two oxygens. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the structure is an ester with a double bond. So, the ester group (two oxygens), a double bond (DoU +1), and the carbonyl from the ester (DoU +1), but that would require two DoU. Which fits since the formula has two DoU. But where is the -OH?

Ah! Wait, maybe the ester is part of a structure where the -OH is on the ester oxygen. But that would make it an acid, not an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester has an -OH on the R group. For example, R-O-CO-R', where R has an -OH. But that would add another oxygen, making it three, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think about the mass spec again. Maybe the fragment at 45 corresponds to an acetate group. Wait, acetate is C2H3O2^- (mass 60). No, but 45 is close to that.

Wait, 45 is 45. Another possibility: the fragment is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like CH3CO (43). But that's not 45. Or maybe CH3CO-O- (which would be 60). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketene fragment. Ketene is O=C=O, but that's 44. Close to 45, but not quite.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. If this breaks into a fragment of 45 (C3H7O?), but let's see:

C3H7O has a molecular weight of 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment with two carbons. C2H5O: 24 +5 +16=45. Oh! Wait, C2H5O is 24 (2*12) +5 (5 H) +16 (O) = 24+5+16=45. So a fragment of C2H5O would have a mass of 45.

So in the mass spectrum, the fragment at m/z=45 could be the ethyl group (C2H5O+) or perhaps a similar group.

So, if the compound is an ester with a structure that can lose an ethyl group, then the remaining would be a larger fragment. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2CH2COO(C2H5), then losing the C2H5 group would leave the rest. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is an ester where the R group is ethyl (C2H5), and the other part is something that upon fragmentation would leave the ethyl group as a fragment.

So, for example, the structure could be CH2=CHCOOEt (ethyl acrylate). The formula would be C5H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2, which is two more carbons and two more hydrogens. So perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diester or something else.

But perhaps the structure is more like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's calculate the formula: C6H10O2. Yes, that's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. That fits option C.

In such a structure, the ester group is COOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), and the double bond is CH2=CHCH2-. So the NMR would show vinyl H's (from CH2=CH). The IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700 and the double bond around 1650. Also, the broad peak at 3000 would suggest an -OH group. Wait, but in this structure, there's no -OH. So that's a problem.

Ah, right. So the structure I thought of doesn't have an -OH. So that's conflicting with the IR data.

So, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. But that would have three oxygens: two from the ester and one from the -OH. So the formula would be C6H10O3, which isn't one of the options. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Now I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think of the correct answer based on the data.

The IR has -OH, carbonyl, and possibly another group. The NMR has vinyl H's. The mass has a fragment at 45, which might be C2H5O.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is (6*12)+(10)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at 114. If the fragment at 45 is a significant portion, perhaps it's a result of losing a 69 fragment (114-45=69), but I don't know what 69 would be.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks into two parts: 45 and 69. But without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment at 45 is from the loss of a group like (CH2)2O, which is 44. Close to 45. Maybe a small error in the question.

Putting all this together, the most plausible option seems to be option C: C6H10O2.

Because it has two oxygens, which can account for the ester group (carbonyl) and the -OH. The DoU of 2 allows for both the double bond (from vinyl H's) and the carbonyl. The fragment at 45 could correspond to a C2H5O group.

So, after considering all the data, I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The options provided are:

- **A)** C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$  
- **B)** C$_6$H$_{10}$O  
- **C)** C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$  
- **D)** C$_6$H$_{12}$O  

### Key Observations and Analysis:

1. **FTIR Data**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm$^{-1}$ suggests the presence of an -OH group.  
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm$^{-1}$ and 1650 cm$^{-1}$ indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (likely an ester or ketone) and possibly a conjugated double bond.

2. **$^1$H NMR Data**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a possible fragment such as C$_2$H$_5$O, which could correspond to an ethyl group.

4. **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**:  
   - **A)** C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$: DoU = 1 (one ring or double bond).  
   - **B)** C$_6$H$_{10}$O: DoU = 2 (two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds).  
   - **C)** C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$: DoU = 2 (two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds).  
   - **D)** C$_6$H$_{12}$O: DoU = 1 (one ring or double bond).  

### Elimination of Options:

- **Option B (C$_6$H$_{10}$O)**:  
  This formula has only one oxygen atom. Since the FTIR data indicates both a carbonyl group and an -OH group, which require two oxygen atoms, this option is eliminated.

- **Option D (C$_6$H$_{12}$O)**:  
  Similar to Option B, this formula has only one oxygen atom, making it unable to account for both the carbonyl group and the -OH group. Thus, it is also eliminated.

- **Option A (C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$)**:  
  This formula has a DoU of 1, which allows for either a ring or a double bond, but not both. Since the $^1$H NMR data shows vinyl hydrogens (indicating a double bond) and the FTIR data shows a carbonyl group, this option is inconsistent with the data and is eliminated.

- **Option C (C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$)**:  
  This formula has a DoU of 2, which accounts for both the double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR) and the carbonyl group (from the FTIR). The two oxygen atoms can accommodate the -OH group and the carbonyl group. The fragment at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrum is consistent with a C$_2$H$_5$O group, which could arise from the ester functionality.

### Conclusion:

The compound is most consistent with the formula **C$_6$H$_{10}$O$_2$**, as it satisfies all the given data: the FTIR peaks, the $^1$H NMR peaks, and the mass spectrometry fragment.
