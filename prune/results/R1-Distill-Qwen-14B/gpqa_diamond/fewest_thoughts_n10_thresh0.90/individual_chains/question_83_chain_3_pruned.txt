Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to titrations, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So first, let me read the problem again carefully. 

We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

I remember that for titration problems, especially weak acids with strong bases, the pH at different points can be found using various methods like the initial concentration, buffer solutions, or equivalence points.

First, let me find the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the moles of solute stay the same, but the volume increases.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume. The volume is 0.02 liters, so 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

So after dilution, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water (0.02 L) makes the total volume 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which has a concentration of 0.1 M. So when we reach 25% titration, what does that mean? I think 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So 25% titration is when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

So first, let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Wait, but maybe I need that for the equivalence point pH.

But perhaps I can approach each part separately.

First, let's handle the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate (CH3COO^-)
