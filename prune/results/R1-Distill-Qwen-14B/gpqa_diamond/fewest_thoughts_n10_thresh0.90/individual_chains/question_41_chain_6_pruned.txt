Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. Hmm. It says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the glass is moving toward the observer, but the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. Wait, no, the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction. So the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them? Or no, maybe the beam is going toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, meaning moving towards the observer too.

I think I need to figure out the speed of the light in the glass as seen by the lab observer. So normally, when light is in a medium, its speed is v_medium = c / n. But here, the medium (glass) is moving relative to the lab frame. So this seems like a problem involving both the refractive index and possibly the Doppler effect or velocity addition from relativity.

Wait, but the speed of light in any inertial frame is always c. Wait that's in a vacuum. Oh, right, because of special relativity. But when light is in a medium, like glass, its speed is lower. So in the rest frame of the glass, the speed is v = c/n. But the lab is moving relative to the glass.

Wait, but how does the motion of the glass affect the speed of light in the lab frame? Because from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving. So how do you transform the velocity of the light?

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula for velocity addition is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the first frame relative to the second. But wait, that's for objects with mass, but light is massless.

Wait, but in this case, the light is moving at v = c/n in the glass's
