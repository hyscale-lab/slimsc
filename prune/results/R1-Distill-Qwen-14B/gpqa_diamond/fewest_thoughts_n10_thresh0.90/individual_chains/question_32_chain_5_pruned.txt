Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96c. Hmm, X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Let me think about this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals a mass number of 6. So X is Li-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96 times the speed of light, c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So I can calculate gamma using v = 0.96c.

Let me plug that in. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared. Let's compute that:

0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. 0.28 times 3.5714 is roughly 1. Because 0.28 * 3.5 is 0.98, and 0.28 * 0.0714 is about 0.02, so together that's 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, I should compute it more accurately. Let me do the math precisely. Let me write 0.96 squared as (96/100)^2, which is (24^2)/(25^2) = 576/625. So 1 - 576/625 is (625-576)/625 = 49/625. The square root of 49 is 7, and square root of 625 is 25. So sqrt(49/625)=7/25=0.28. So yes, exactly 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 25/7 â‰ˆ 3.5714286.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass of Li-6. I know that the atomic mass of Lithium-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but wait, I should get the exact value. Alternatively, maybe I can look up the mass of Li-6 in kilograms, but perhaps I can find the rest energy in
