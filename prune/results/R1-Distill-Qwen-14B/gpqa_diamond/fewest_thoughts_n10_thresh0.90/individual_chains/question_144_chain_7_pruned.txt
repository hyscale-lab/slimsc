Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what the question is. The question is about meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember from my classes that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance is related to their lifetime and speed. 

The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters. 

Wait, I think the mean decay distance is calculated by the product of the particle's speed (v) and its lifetime (τ). So the formula should be distance = v * τ. But I'm not entirely sure about the steps, so I need to break it down.

First, I should find the lifetime τ. I remember that for a particle, the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty and Δt is the time uncertainty. For a particle, the width Γ is the energy uncertainty, so Γ = ħ / τ. Rearranging that gives τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ has units of energy. Oh right, since ħ has units of energy·time, dividing by Γ (energy) gives time. So that formula makes sense.

Wait, but I should also remember that the width Γ is given in MeV and the mass in GeV. I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let's convert Γ to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Next, I think I need to find the speed v of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X, which is higher than its rest mass, it must be moving relativistically. The energy E is related to the total energy of the particle, which includes its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The formula for energy in relativity is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², where p is momentum and m is the rest mass.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the relation between energy, mass, and velocity. The relativistic energy is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). 

Given E_X = 8 GeV and m_X = 1.2 GeV, so γ = 8 / 1.2 = approximately 6.666... So γ is about 6.6667.

Once I have γ, I can find the velocity v. The Lorentz factor γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So solving for v, I have v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Let me compute that. So γ is (8/1.2) = 6.6667. So 1/γ² is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is about 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887. Which is roughly 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me calculate it step by step.

Compute γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ squared is (6.6667)^2. Let's see: 6 * 6 is 36, 0.6667^2 is about 0.444, and 2*6*0.6667 is 8, so (6 + 2/3)^2 = 6^2 + 2*6*(2/3) + (2/3)^2 = 36 + 8 + 4/9 ≈ 44.444... So γ^2 is 44.4444, so 1/γ^2 is 0.0225. 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775: let's calculate. 0.988^2 is 0.976144. 0.989^2 is 0.978121. Wait, 0.9775 is between these. Let me compute 0.988^2 = (0.98)^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 + (0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144. 0.989^2 is (0.98 + 0.009)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.009 + 0.009² = 0.9604 + 0.01764 + 0.000081 = 0.978121. Our target is 0.9775, which is between these.

Let me try 0.9885: 0.9885^2 = (0.98)^2 + 2*(0.98)*(0.0085) + (0.0085)^2. Let's compute each term.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2 * 0.98 * 0.0085 = 0.01666.

(0.0085)^2 = 0.00007225.

Adding up: 0.9604 + 0.01666 = 0.97706 + 0.00007225 ≈ 0.97713225. That's a bit higher than 0.9775? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute sqrt(0.9775). Let's approximate it. Let me think: 0.9775 is 0.9775 = 1 - 0.0225. So sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 when x is small. So x is 0.0225, so sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 1 - 0.01125 = 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875 c. So about 0.9888c. So v ≈ 0.9888 * speed of light.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this approximation is accurate enough. Maybe I should compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can just proceed with the approximate value and see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more exactly using a calculator approach. But since I'm doing this mentally, perhaps the approximation is sufficient.

So, moving on. Now that I have v ≈ 0.9888 c, the next step is to find the lifetime τ.

As I thought earlier, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ = h/(2π), and h is Planck's constant, which is about 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. Since 1 GeV = 1.602 × 10^-10 J, then ħ in GeV·s is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me get the exact value. Yes, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s.

Compute 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 × 20 = 6.4. So 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182. So 0.32 × 20.565 = 6.582 (since 0.32 × 0.565 = 0.1808, adding to 6.4 gives 6.5808). So approximately 20.565. So 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.565. So τ ≈ 20.565e-25 s = 2.0565e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, no wait: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875
