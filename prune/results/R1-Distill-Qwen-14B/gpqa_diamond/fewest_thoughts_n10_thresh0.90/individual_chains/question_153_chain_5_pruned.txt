Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, which forms an enolate. But wait, I'm a bit confused, so let me think through this step by step.

The question gives three different reactions, labeled (A), (B), and (C), and asks about the major products. Then there are four options (A to D) each providing possible products. I need to figure out each reaction's outcome and match it to the options.

First, let's tackle reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH as reagents. 

I recall that dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. In Michael addition, the nucleophile (like malonate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The other component here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this is probably something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. The formula given is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO-O-. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3-position. Wait, maybe the structure is different. Alternatively, maybe it's more like CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)CO-OCH3? No, wait, that wouldn't make sense. Oh wait, the correct structure for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate. Wait, no, the numbering might be off. Let me think: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the acrylate part. Wait, perhaps the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3-position. Alternatively
