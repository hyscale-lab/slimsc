Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D with different exponents.

Hmm. Right, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/distance, where distance is usually in parsecs. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem states that the number of stars (N) varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in. So plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. So substituting, N ∝ d^5. But wait, wait a second. Wait, the equation is 1/plx^5. Let me calculate that.

If plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. That means as distance increases, the number of stars increases rapidly—like d to the fifth power.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so it's about the number of stars per unit distance. So maybe I need to find the derivative of N with respect to d, or perhaps find how star density changes.

Wait, let's think. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases with distance. But the question is about the change per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's the slope, the derivative. Let's model this.

Let me define N as a function of distance d. So N(d) = k * d^5, where k is the proportionality constant.

The number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to d, which is dN/dd. So dN/dd = 5k d^4.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of stars in a
