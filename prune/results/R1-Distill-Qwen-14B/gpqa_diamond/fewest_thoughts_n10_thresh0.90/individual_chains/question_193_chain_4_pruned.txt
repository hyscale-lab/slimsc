Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So if distance increases, parallax decreases. 

The number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ (d)^5. Oh wait, because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5.

Wait a second, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So maybe I need to think about it in terms of a differential—like, how does N change as you move a small distance dr.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the number density or the number per unit volume. Because when you consider a region of the sky, the number of stars you observe depends on both the area (which is constant for a given region) and the volume along the line of sight. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, another approach. The number of stars in a given volume is related to their density. If the density is uniform, then the number of stars N is proportional to the volume. But here, the relation given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So perhaps I need to express the volume in terms of distance and parallax.

Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Let me think about how N relates to distance.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting gives N ∝ d^5. So as distance d increases, N increases as d^5. But wait, that can't be right because if you're looking at a larger volume, the number of stars should increase with the volume, which is proportional to d^3. So why is the exponent higher here?

Wait, maybe the question isn't about the total number within a certain distance, but perhaps the number per unit volume, or maybe it's considering some other factor. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the number of stars per unit distance. So how does the number of stars (per unit distance) change as you go further away. Wait, maybe not. Let me re-express the given relation.

The number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. And since plx is 1/d, N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

Wait, but if that's the case, when d increases, N increases more rapidly than d^3, which is the typical case for volume (since volume increases as r^3). So if N is proportional to d^5, that's a much steeper increase.

But the question is about the change in the number of stars per unit range of distance. So maybe it's about the differential number of stars, like the number of stars per unit distance interval.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance (dN/dr) would be proportional to 5 d^4. But wait, that's the derivative. But the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr is proportional to something.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me get back.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting gives N ∝ d^5.

So as d increases, N increases with d^5. So the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance. So per unit range, how does it change? Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the number per unit volume is a function of distance. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to express N as a function of distance and find how it scales. So given N = k * (1/plx)^5, and plx = 1/d, so N = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how N changes with distance. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power.

Looking at the options, option B is ~r^5, which would align with that. But wait, wait a second. The initial assumption is that N varies as 1/plx^5. If parallax is 1/d, then N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars in the region increases as you go further, which seems counterintuitive because you'd expect fewer stars at larger distances if the density is uniform, but perhaps the density isn't uniform here.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, wait, no, the problem says "in a specific region of the sky." So perhaps it's not about the total number within a distance, but the number per unit area. Because when you observe a region of the sky, you can see more distant stars, but their density may depend on distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the number of stars in a small volume (per unit volume) increases with distance.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's model this. The number of stars in a region depends on how many are there at a certain distance. Suppose I have a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of the shell is approximately 4πd² dr (since it's a spherical shell). The number of stars in that shell would be the density at that distance multiplied by the volume. But if the density isn't uniform, perhaps it's varying with d in some way.

Wait, but the given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So in that specific region of the sky, for stars at distance d, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5 = d^5.

Wait, but that's not considering the actual
