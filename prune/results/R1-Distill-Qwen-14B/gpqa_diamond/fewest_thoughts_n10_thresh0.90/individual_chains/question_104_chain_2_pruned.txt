Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we measure that shift in the spectral lines.

The question involves two stars with the same mass as each other, both similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune, so same mass. The planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's signal is related to the planet's mass and the star's velocity. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) * (1/(1+M_p/M_star))^(something). But since the planets are similar to Neptune and much less massive than the stars, M_p is negligible compared to M_star. So maybe we can ignore the (1+M_p/M_star) term.

Wait another thought: the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The semi-amplitude K (star's velocity) is given by ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (P * (2π)) ) ). But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So it's approximately (G M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )) )^(1/ (2π)) ) ? Hmm, maybe I should look up the exact formula because I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression.

Wait, I think the key formula is that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (2π G )^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait no, perhaps more accurately, the formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( (2π)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so (M_star)^(2/3), but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period P, given that all else is the same except K and P.

Wait, the problem says the stars have the same mass. So M_star is same for both. Both planets have same mass, same M_p. The same sin i? Well, the problem doesn't specify inclination, so maybe
