Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. We're told that when measuring the position, none were found at x < 1 or x >3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition, which means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. This ensures the total probability is 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd. Usually, wave functions are complex, so maybe the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). Or perhaps it's a product or sum? Wait, the way it's written is a bit unclear. Oh, wait, looking again: it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i)? Or is it (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus (0.5i)? Hmm, the wording says "( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i". So that's a complex number, with the real part being a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part being -0.5.

But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about it differently. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, ψ(x) is a complex number where the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but that would make ψ(x) a function where the imaginary part is constant. That's strange because usually, the wave function's imaginary part depends on x, but perhaps it's valid.

But the important point is that the wave function must be normalized. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given, but the question says "in a part of space where it can exist". Since particles are found only between x=1 and x=3, perhaps the wave function is zero outside that region, but in this case, the given function is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. Or perhaps the given expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Hmm, the question says each particle can be found only between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside that interval. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, does that mean that ψ(x)=0 for x <1 and x>3?

Alternatively, perhaps the given ψ(x) is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and perhaps the expression applies there. Wait, but the question states that the wave function in the part of space where it can exist is given as (a/sqrt(...)), so maybe ψ(x) is zero outside that region.

So to compute the normalization, we integrate |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3, because outside that, ψ is zero.

So the normalization condition is:

∫ (from 1 to 3) |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

But ψ(x) is a complex number. So let's compute |ψ(x)|².

ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

So the absolute square is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b².

Wait, no. Wait, ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5i). So the complex conjugate is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (-0.5i) = a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i. So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + (0.5)^2.

Wait, no, maybe I should compute it properly.

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i.

The modulus squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

So real part is a/sqrt(1+x), imaginary part is -0.5. So modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 is ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), imaginary part is -0.5.

So |ψ|^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but the integral over x=1 to x=3 of this will be the sum of two integrals: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus 0.25*(3-1) because the integral of 1 dx from 1 to3 is 2.

Wait, let's calculate each part.

First part: a² ∫ from 1 to3 of 1/(1+x) dx.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluated from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

Second part: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

We can write this equation: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

Solving for a²: a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate 0.5 / ln(2).

ln(2) ≈ 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. Option D is 0.6, which is smaller.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in calculating |ψ|^2?

Because ψ(x) is a complex number: (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, the modulus squared is |a/sqrt(1+x)|^2 + |(-0.5i)|^2, which is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So the integral becomes a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. So the closest option is B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Let me compute 0.5 / ln(2):

ln(2)=0.69314718056...

So 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.721347.

Square root of 0.721347 is approximately 0.849.

Yes, so 0.85 is correct.

Wait, but the options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

So the answer is B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over the region where the particle exists must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 1 \, dx = 1
\]

1. For the first term, \( \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \), the integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2) \approx 0.6931
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2)
\]

2. For the second term, \( 0.25 \int_1^3 1 \, dx \), the integral of \( 1 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) is simply \( 3 - 1 = 2 \). Therefore, the second term is:

\[
0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5
\]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
