Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, the question says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So normally, a lithium nucleus has 3 protons and some neutrons. But here, it's Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which means its mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its rest mass and velocity. The problem is asking for the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy.

The total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.

Let me compute gamma. Plugging in v=0.96c:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2/(c^2)) )
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)
= 1 / sqrt(0.0784)
= 1 / 0.28
Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = approx 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more precisely. 0.96^2 is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 which is exactly 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me check with a calculator. Let me compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 3.57142857.

But wait, maybe I should compute the square root more precisely. Let
