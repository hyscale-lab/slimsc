Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is that I've prepared an unknown compound and used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify it. I need to choose the correct chemical formula from four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let me go through each of the characterization techniques one by one and see what information I can extract.

First up is the FTIR spectrum. The problem states that there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually correspond to O-H stretches. A very broad peak might suggest hydrogen bonding, which is common in compounds like alcohols, carboxylic acids, or maybe ethers if there's something else, but I'm not sure. Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. I remember that the carbonyl group (C=O) absorbs around 1700 cm^-1. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or an aromatic ring, like conjugated double bonds or maybe an amide. But wait, the question also mentions that the NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are on a double bond, so maybe there's a conjugated system here.

So putting that together, the 1700 and 1650 peaks could indicate two different carbonyl groups, or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring (which can have absorption around 1600-1650 due to C=C stretching). But the presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests O-H. So it's probably an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very broad and around 2500-3300, which fits, but the 1700 cm^-1 would be the C=O stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone, but then where does the O-H come from? So perhaps it's an alcohol with a carbonyl group. Or maybe a conjugate system with a carbonyl.

Wait, but another thought: the 1650 could be an amide. But I don't have any info about NMR signals for amines or amides. So perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl. Another possibility is that the 1700 is a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring, maybe with conjugation. So the compound might have both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Moving on to the NMR. It says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So the compound must have at least one double bond. So maybe it's an aromatic compound, but vinyl could also be part of another structure, like a conjugated diene or something. But since the IR suggests a carbonyl, maybe it's a compound like a ketone with a double bond nearby, leading to vinyl hydrogens.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm. Let's think about what fragments would give m/z 45. Common fragments include things like (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's ether). Or another possibility: a water molecule is 18, but 45 is more than that. Wait, 45 could be a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe a ketene (which I'm not too sure about), but more likely, a common fragment like from an ester.

Wait, another approach: what's the possible molecular formula? The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight would be (12*6)+(1*12)+(16*2) =72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: (72)+(10)+(16)=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72+10+32=114.

D) C6H12O:72+12+16=100.

So the molecular formulas have different degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate that.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is given by DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or N, it's (2C +2 - H - O)/2.

For each option:

A) C6H12O2:

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 2)/2 = (14 -14)/2 = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, formula is (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2.

Assuming X=0, N=0:

A: 2*6+2=14; 14 -12 (H) -2 (O) )=0. Divide by 2: 0. So DoU is 0. That would mean all single bonds, but the presence of vinyl H suggests a double bond. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, the formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

So for option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 - 12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1.

So one degree of unsaturation.

Which can be a double bond or a ring.

For option B: C=6, H=10, O=1.

DoU = (14 -10 -0)/2 =4/2=2.

So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (14 -10 -2*O) ??? Wait, no. Wait, formula is (2C+2 -H -X + N)/2. So O doesn't factor into the formula. So:

(2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2.

So DoU=2. So one ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU = (14 -12)/2=2/2=1. So one degree.

So the options have either 1 or 2 degrees. Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are on a double bond, that's at least one degree of unsaturation. So options with one DoU could have a ring plus a double bond or a triple bond (unlikely), or just a double bond. But then if the IR shows a carbonyl, which is another double bond, that would require two DoU. Wait, but carbonyl is a double bond (C=O), contributing one DoU. If the compound has a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl, that would be two DoU. So the molecular formula must have at least two DoU.

Wait, but looking back, the options:

Option A: DoU=1. That would only account for one double bond or ring. But we have two (carbonyl and vinyl), so option A can't be correct.

Option B: DoU=2. So that's possible. It would have two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: DoU=2. Same as B.

Option D: DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. But our analysis suggests two DoU (from carbonyl and vinyl groups), so options B and C are possibilities.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the carbonyl is one DoU and the vinyl is another. So the molecular formula would need DoU ≥2.

So the options with DoU=2 are B and C.

So now, let's go back to the IR and NMR.

IR has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. That's a strong O-H stretch, likely an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H is even broader and around 2500-3300, but the presence of a carbonyl at 1700 cm^-1 would fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, but esters have two carbonyls? Or maybe a ketone with an alcohol group.

But wait, another possibility: if it's a conjugated carbonyl, the peak might be a bit lower. For example, conjugated double bonds can cause shifts. The 1700 is typical for a ketone or an ester's carbonyl, but the 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

If the compound has both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond (like an α,β-unsaturated ketone), then the 1650 could be the C=C. Let's think: in an α,β-unsaturated ketone, the C=O is around 1700, and the conjugated C=C would be around 1650. That makes sense. So the IR data would support that structure.

So if the compound is an α,β-unsaturated ketone, perhaps with an alcohol group. So that would have a carbonyl (C=O), a conjugated double bond (C=C), and an O-H group. So that would explain the IR peaks.

Now, looking at the NMR: presence of vinyl hydrogens (on the C=C) would show up as a peak around δ 5-7 ppm, maybe as a doublet or triplet, depending on substitution.

The fact that there's a broad peak between 3000 and 3500 would correspond to the O-H proton. But for an alcohol, that would be a broad peak, but maybe split into multiple peaks if it's an -OH group. Alternatively, for a carboxylic acid, the O-H is a very broad singlet, but I'm not sure how that would look in the NMR.

Wait, but the NMR is 1H NMR, so the O-H in a carboxylic acid would be a broad peak, but maybe exchanged and might not show up if the sample is not perfectly dry. Or it could be an alcohol, which would have a peak around 1-5 ppm, but that's for the O-H stretch. Wait, no, the O-H in an alcohol is usually a broad peak around 1-5 ppm? Wait, no, wait. The O-H in alcohols is typically a broad peak around 1.5-5 ppm, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact region. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic O-H, which is usually broader and around 5 ppm. But if the compound has an O-H that's exchanging, it might appear as a broad peak or might be missing, depending on how the sample was prepared.

But in this case, the question says that the NMR has several peaks including those for vinyl hydrogens. So if the O-H is present, it would be another peak. But the question doesn't specify any O-H signal, so perhaps the O-H is missing, or it's part of a functional group like an ester or something else.

Wait, another angle: the mass spectrum. The fragment peak at m/z=45. Let's think about what that could correspond to.

45 is an odd mass, so it's likely a fragment with an even number of carbons or maybe a group that includes oxygen. Let's think about possible fragments:

- (CH3)2O is 45 (2*15 + 16 = 46? Wait, (CH3)2O is diethyl ether? No, wait, (CH3)2O would be (2*15 (CH3) ) + 16 (O) = 46? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, CH3-O-CH3 is diethyl ether? No, that's diethyl ether is (C2H5)2O, which would be (2*12 +5*1) *2 +16= (29*2)+16=74. That's way bigger than 45.

Wait, 45 could be the fragment CH3-CO-O-? No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps a smaller group.

Wait, another approach: 45 might correspond to a group like CH2=CH-O something. Or maybe it's a (CH2)2O group, but that would be 44 (12*2 +4 +16). No. Wait, another possibility: a fragment like CH2CH2O (but that's not possible). Alternatively, a propyl group attached to something else.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of what? Let me calculate: 45 = 12a +1b +16c. Looking for integers a, b, c.

Possible combinations:

- C3H9O: (3*12)+(9*1)+(16)=36+9+16=61. No.

- C3H3O2: (36)+(3)+(32)=71. No.

Wait, wait. Let me think of 45 as a possible fragment. Another possibility is that it's a CH2CH2O group, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene group, which is O=C=O, but that's 64. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to another group. For example, if the molecule breaks at a certain bond, the fragment could be CH3CO+ (which is 43, but 43 isn't 45). Or perhaps something like CH3-O- would be 31 (15 +16), but again not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is the loss of a larger group. Let's consider the molecular formulas.

Looking at the options and their molecular weights:

Option A: C6H12O2 → 116. If the molecular ion is at 116, a fragment at 45 could be a loss of 71 (116-45=71). What's 71? 71 is C3H7O (3*12+7+16=36+7+16=59? No. Alternatively, 71 could be a bromine atom, but that's not in the formula.

Option B: C6H10O → 98. 98-45=53. 53 is C3H7S or C3H5Cl, but again, not likely. Or perhaps 53 is a CO fragment (28) plus something.

Option C: C6H10O2 → 114. 114-45=69. 69 could be C4H9O (4*12 +9 +16=48+9+16=73, nope. Or C3H5O2: 36 +5 +32=73, no.

Option D: C6H12O → 100. 100-45=55. 55 could be C3H5O (36 +5 +16=57, no. Or C3H7O2: 36+7+32=75, no. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the m/z=45 is a carbonyl group. Like a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, 45 is the mass of a fragment that includes a carbonyl. Like CH3COOH (which is 60) but that's larger. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3COO- as a fragment. Wait, CH3COO- is 59 (12*2 + 3*1 +16*2=24+3+32=59). No, that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the possible structure could be an ester. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R'. Alternatively, maybe a diester.

Wait, considering the IR data, which has a carbonyl and an O-H. So if the compound is an ester, the IR would show the C=O around 1700, and maybe an O-H from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But esters don't have O-H unless it's an ester with an -OH group, like in a hemiacetal or something. Wait, that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester or something like that. For example, ethyl acetoacetate has both a carbonyl and an ester group. Its structure is CH3COCH2COOEt. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So perhaps the structure has a conjugated system, like a ketone next to a double bond (α,β-unsaturated ketone). Such a structure would have a conjugated C=O and C=C.

So if the compound is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with an alcohol group, like 3-penten-2-one with an -OH group somewhere.

But the molecular formula would have to fit. Let's think about the structure.

But this might be getting too detailed. Let me try to piece together the clues.

IR: Broad peak at 3000 → O-H group (probably alcohol or carboxylic acid).

IR: 1700 → C=O (carbonyl group, perhaps ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.)

IR: 1650 → Maybe C=C (conjugated with carbonyl), or aromatic ring. Since the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, it's more likely a C=C.

So the compound has both a C=O and a C=C.

So the structure could be an α,β-unsaturated ketone with an -OH group. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic structure.

Now the molecular formula.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. Let's calculate degrees of unsaturation. 2 DoU. So that could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

If the structure is a cyclic α,β-unsaturated ketone with an -OH, perhaps a six-membered ring, that would account for the DoU.

But let's think about the mass spectrometry. The m/z=45 could be a fragment. Let's think about possible groups that would lose or form such a peak.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (which is acetone, 58? No, wait: (CH3)2CO is (2*15) + (12) +16 =30+12+16=58. No. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if the molecule breaks to form a fragment with a ketone group. For example, a (CH2)2CO group would have a mass of (2*14) +12 +16 =28+28=56? No. Maybe a (CH3)CO- group would be 43 (12+3 +12 +16 =43. Hmm, not 45).

Wait, 45 could be a fragment that's a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. For example, (CH3)CO-O- would be a part of an ester, but that's 45? Let me calculate. (CH3)CO-O- is (15) + (12 +16) + (16) =15 +28 +16=59? No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene group. A ketene is O=C=O, but that's a larger group.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl ester. For example
