Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

The question gives me three main pieces of data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogens and oxygens. The options are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O, C) C6H10O2, D) C6H12O.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad—could that be a strong hydrogen bond, like in a carboxylic acid? Or maybe an -OH group in an ester or something else?

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 is a bit lower than 1700—maybe it's another carbonyl, but perhaps conjugated or part of another functional group. Wait, could 1700 be a ketone or ester, and 1650 maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, or perhaps another carbonyl like a conjugated ester or an amide? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, where the C=O is around 1700 and the C=C is around 1650. Or maybe the 1650 is a C=C stretch. Hmm, but I think aromatic rings have C=C around 1450-1600. So 1650 could be a conjugated C=O, like in an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in a C=C double bond, so this suggests that the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene somewhere. So, that's an important clue. So the compound has a double bond, perhaps in an ester group or part of a ring, or an isolated alkene.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragment has a mass of 45. Let me think about common fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO, which is acetone (propan-2-one). Or perhaps it's (CH3)CO- or something else. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment resulting from COO- (like in a carboxylic acid loss of something?), but wait, COO- would be 44, since COO is 12+16+16=44. So 45 is one more than that. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3CO+ (43) but that's not 45. Wait, 45 could be something like (CH3)2CH– but that's 58. Hmm, maybe it's a fragment from an ester. Wait, another approach: look at the molecular formulas and see which one could give a fragment of 45.

The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. Let's compute their degrees of unsaturation to see possible structures.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

So for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and an ester group.

Option B: C6H10O
DoU = (14 -10)/2 = 2. So two DoU, maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

Option C: C6H10O2
DoU = (14 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Two DoU. Could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or a carbonyl and a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O
DoU = (14 -12)/2 =1. So same as option A, but without the second oxygen. So perhaps a ketone or an ether, but with a ring or a double bond.

So, looking at the FTIR: the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is probably an -OH group. But wait, if it's a broad peak, it's more likely to be a carboxylic acid -OH, which is typically broader than an alcohol. Alternatively, an ester would have an -OR group, which doesn't have a broad peak. So if it's a broad peak, maybe it's a phenolic -OH, but phenol's O-H is usually broader and around 3300, or a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an alcohol, but the peak isn't as broad as a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the problem says 'very broad', so that suggests a strong hydrogen bonding, which is more typical of carboxylic acid. So perhaps the compound has a carboxylic acid group. Alternatively, maybe a ketone? No, a ketone wouldn't have an O-H. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: an ester group has an -O- group, which might not show a strong, broad peak. But a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch.

So if the compound has a carboxylic acid group, that would account for the broad peak. Then, the 1700 cm⁻¹ would be the C=O of the carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have C=O around 1700, but they can be a bit lower if deprotonated or in different environments. So if FTIR shows 1700 and 1650, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated double bond. Because, if the compound has a conjugated system, like a C=C near the C=O, the C=O might be at 1700, and the C=C at 1650. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester and a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but let's think about the other peaks. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so an alkene is present. So the compound has a double bond. So probably, besides the carbonyl, there's a double bond elsewhere.

Putting that together: a carbonyl (C=O) and a double bond, perhaps in an ester or a ketone with a double bond.

Wait, but let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. Let's think what structures could produce a 45 fragment.

45 is a common fragment. Let's consider possible structures.

Looking at the options, the molecular formulas are:

A) C6H12O2 → Possible structures could be an ester, like a methyl ester of a pentanoic acid or something similar.

Wait, let's compute for each option what the molecular weight would be.

Molecular weight calculations:

A) C6H12O2: (6*12) + (12*1) + (2*16) → 72 +12 +32= 116 g/mol.

B) C6H10O: (6*12)+(10*1)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: (72)+(10)+(32)=114.

D) C6H12O: 72+12+16=100.

The mass spectrum shows a peak at m/z=45, which is much lower than any of these. So the fragment comes from losing parts of the molecule. So what would give a fragment of 45?

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ester, perhaps the molecule could be something like methyl cyclopentene carboxylate? Or more likely, perhaps the ester is something else.

Alternatively, think about possible cleavage points. For example, if the molecule undergoes cleavage at the ester group, maybe the ester oxygen breaks. Let's say the ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but actually, more accurately, esters are R-O-CO-R'. If the ester breaks, perhaps the carbonyl group (COO-) could leave as a fragment. Wait, but the molecular weight of COO- is 44 (12+16*2=44). So if the fragment is at 45, that's one more than COO-.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)COO-? Wait, that would be a mass of 59- but wait, no. Let me compute: (CH3)COO- would be C2H5O2^-. Wait, no, that's 43 (12*2 +5 +16*2)= 24 +5 +32=61? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a different fragment.

Another approach: think of the molecular formula of the fragment. 45 is 45 g/mol. So the fragment would have a molecular weight of 45. Let's see what possible combination of C, H, O gives 45.

45 = 12a + 1b +16c.

Looking for integers a, b, c.

Possible options:

- a=3, c=1: 36 +16=52 → too high.
- a=2, c=1: 24 +16=40 → 40 +5 =45. So 2 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen? Wait, 2*12=24, 10*1=10, 16 → 24+10+16=50. No, that's too much. Wait, maybe 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and 2 oxygen: 24 +5 +32=61. No. Hmm.

Wait, another way: 45 could be C2H9O2? No, that would be 2*12 +9 +32= 24+9+32=65. No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a loss of a larger group. Let me think about the ester cleavage.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is an acylium ion. An acylium ion would be R-CO(+). For example, if the ester breaks to form a ketene fragment.

Wait, let's think about specific examples. Suppose the compound is methyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its molecular formula is C4H6O2. Let's see what its mass spectrum would look like. The molecular ion would be at 88 (4*12 +6 +32= 48 +6 +32=86? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Let me compute: C4H6O2: (4×12)=48, H=6, O=32 → total 86. So m/z 86. Then, fragments could lose the methyl group (CH3, m/z 15) to give 71, but that's not 45. Alternatively, the molecule could break at the ester oxygen, leading to a fragment that's CH2=CHCOO- and CH3. The CH2=CHCOO- would have a mass of 73 (48? Wait, wait, CH2=CHCOO- is C3H3O2^-: 3×12=36, 3×1=3, 32 → 71. So m/z 71. Not 45.

Hmm, another thought: if the compound is an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate. Phenyl acetate is C6H5COOCH2Ph? No, wait, phenyl acetate is C6H5COOCH2C6H5. Wait, no, phenyl acetate is C6H5COOCH2Ph? Wait, no. Phenyl acetate is benzoyl-O-phenyl? Or is it C6H5COOCH2C6H5? No, wait, phenyl acetate is C6H5COOCH2Ph. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the compound is something like methyl benzoate, which is PhCOOCH3.

Methyl benzoate is C6H5COOCH3. Its molecular formula is C8H8O2. So that's beyond our options here, which are all C6.

Wait, the options are all C6 compounds. So maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Or perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, another approach: looking back at the NMR. It shows vinyl hydrogens, which are H2C=CH- types, so maybe an ester with an adjacent double bond. For example, an ester like CH2=CHCOO-R. So, for a C6 molecule, the ester might be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's more than six carbons. Wait, perhaps it's a ring structure. For example, a cyclic ester with a double bond in the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like methyl vinyl ketone. Wait, methyl vinyl ketone is (CH2=CH)COCH3, which is C4H6O. But that's only four carbons, not six.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Like CH2=CHCOOR. Let's see the formula: For R being CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would be more than six carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclopentene ester.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently.

FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H stretch. So the compound has an O-H group. So options must have at least one O-H. Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2 → could be a diol, but that would have two O-Hs, but the IR would be even broader. Alternatively, an ester plus a hydroxyl group? Hmm, but esters don't usually have O-H; they have O-R groups. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then O-H is present. So for a carboxylic acid, the formula would have O2. Let's see: a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which would be CnH2nO2. So for n=5, it's C5H10O2. But our options are C6H12O2, C6H10O2, etc. So perhaps it's a substituted carboxylic acid.

Wait, checking the options:

Option A is C6H12O2. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H12O2 (because RCOOH is CnH2nO2; n=6 would be C6H12O2. So yes, option A is possible.

But then, what about the IR? The O-H in a carboxylic acid is broad and around 2500-3300. So the peak at 3000 is correct.

The 1700 peak would be the C=O of the carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be a conjugated double bond.

So in the NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so maybe the compound is a substituted acrylic acid, like CH2=CHCOOH. But wait, that's only 3 carbons in the acid part. So perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, another thought: the compound could be a di-substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond. Like CH2CH2COOH, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexene carboxylic acid, which would have a ring and a double bond.

But then, the NMR would show vinyl protons. So the double bond is present. So perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexene carboxylic acid, which would have the formula C6H10O2. Because cyclohexene is C6H10, adding a COOH (O2) gives C6H10O2. Wait, but the formula for cyclohexene carboxylic acid would be C6H10O2. That's option C.

But let me check the degrees of unsaturation. Option C is C6H10O2. DoU is (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Each double bond or ring is one DoU. So if the molecule is a cyclohexene ring (which is a ring plus a double bond, so two DoU) plus a COOH group (which has a double bond in the C=O), that would account for three DoU. Wait, so that's a problem.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The formula is C6H10O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. So perhaps a ring and a double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds.

Wait, a cyclohexene would have a ring (one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), so that's two. Then adding a COOH group would add another DoU (from the C=O), making three. But the DoU for option C is only two. So that can't be. So perhaps the cyclohexene is without the double bond? No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an ester group that includes a double bond. Hmm, perhaps an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, another approach: if the compound is an ester, like RCOOR', and R' has a double bond. For example, if R is CH2CH2 and R' is CH2CHCH2, but not sure.

Wait, looking back at the NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the alkene is probably isolated and not in an aromatic ring, since aromatic protons usually show up in a different region and as multiplets or singlets. So it's likely a simple alkene.

So, considering all this, the IR suggests a carboxylic acid (O-H) and a C=O. The 1650 peak could be a conjugated double bond next to the C=O, which would make the C=O a bit lower in wavenumber. So maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

Wait, but an alpha,beta-unsaturated acid would have the structure RCH2CH2COOH. No, wait, alpha is the first carbon after the COOH. So the structure would be CH2=CHCOOH, which is acrylic acid. But that's three carbons. So for a six-carbon compound, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCOOH? No, that can't be, because that would be seven carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the molecule is a substituted acrylic acid, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's see the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2. Because CH2=CHCOO is four carbons, and CH2CH2CH3 is three, but wait that's seven. Oh no, wait, no, the ester would be R-O-CO-O-R'? No, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if it's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, then it's C5H8O2. Hmm, perhaps not matching any options except option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, a five-membered ring lactone. Let's see, a five-membered ring would have four carbons in the ring plus the ester oxygen. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester with a double bond. But the options don't seem to suggest that.

Wait, another thought: the mass spec fragment at 45. Let me think of a fragment that would be 45. For example, what if the molecule loses a propyl group (C3H7, which is 51) but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe the molecule loses a butyl group (C4H9, which is 57) but that's not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from the cleavage of the ester group. Let's say the ester is RCOOR', and during fragmentation, the R' group is lost as a fragment. For example, if R' is CH2CH2CH3 (propan-2-yl?), then its mass would be 57 (3 carbons: 3×12=36, 7 H: 7×1=7; O is not part of R' here. So 36+7=43? Hmm, but not 45. Alternatively, R' could be ethyl: C2H5, which is 29. Then the fragment would be RCOO-: 43 (12*2 +16*2 +12 +16= 24+32+12+16 → wait, that's not correct. Wait, RCOO- would be (CH3COO-): that's 43. So if the RCOO- is 43, then the fragment would be at m/z 43. But the given fragment is at 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is CH3CO-O-... No, perhaps it's a different group. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is an acylium ion, like CH3CO(+), which is 43. Still not 45.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the fragment is C3H7O. Let's compute that: 3×12=36, 7×1=7, 16=16. Total 60. No. Alternatively, C2H5O: 24 +5 +16=45. Yes! So C2H5O would have a molecular weight of 45. So what structure gives a fragment of C2H5O?

C2H5O could be an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), but that's an ether. But wait, in mass spectrometry, the ethoxy group as a fragment would have m/z of 45 (12*2 +6 +16= 24+6+16=46? Wait, 12*2=24, 5 H's (since OCH2CH3 has 5 H's?), wait no, OCH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H's? No, OCH2CH3 is CH3CH2O-. So it's C2H5O, which is 24 +5 +16 = 45. Yes, that adds up.

So if the fragment is C2H5O, that would be an ethoxy group. So the molecule must have an ethoxy group. But wait, the options are for C6 compounds. So if the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, then the formula would be RCOOCH2CH3. Let's see: R is a four-carbon chain, because RCOOCH2CH3 would be Cn+2 H2n+2 O2.

Wait, let me compute that. RCOOCH2CH3: R is (CH2)mCH3, perhaps. Let's say R is CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, for RCOO, it's (CH2)mCH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is an ester like CH2CH2CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. No, that's C6H12O2. Let me check: CH2CH2CH2CH2COO is 5 carbons, and CH2CH3 is 2, so total C7. No, that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is an ester with a three-carbon chain plus the ethoxy. Let me think: RCOOCH2CH3, where R is CH2CH2CH2. Wait, that's four carbons. RCOOCH2CH3 would be 4 + 2 =6 carbons. So yes, R is CH2CH2CH2-? Wait, no, R in RCOO is (CH2)mCH2-.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's an ester with a double bond. Let's check the formula: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 is C6H10O2. Because:

- CH2=CHCH2COO is 4 carbons, so CH2=CHCH2COO- is C4H5O2.

Then CH2CH3 is C2H5. So total C6H10O2. Yes, that matches option C.

So let's see:

- FTIR: broad peak at 3000 (the ester doesn't have O-H, but wait, this structure is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, wait a minute. Then why is there a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹?

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. If the compound is an ester, the O-H stretch wouldn't be present. But the FTIR shows a broad peak, which suggests an O-H. So maybe the compound isn't an ester but a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but earlier I considered that the compound could be a carboxylic acid, which would have O-H. But the structure I'm considering now is an ester, which doesn't have O-H. So that's a conflict.

Hmm, maybe I need to reevaluate. Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak isn't an O-H but something else. Wait, another possibility: the broad peak could be from an alcohol O-H. So the compound is an alcohol with a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Wait, back to the options. Let's reevaluate the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester, ketone, or diol. If it's a diol, the O-H would be present. But the IR would show two broad peaks for two O-H groups, but the question says a very broad peak, singular. So perhaps a diol is less likely
