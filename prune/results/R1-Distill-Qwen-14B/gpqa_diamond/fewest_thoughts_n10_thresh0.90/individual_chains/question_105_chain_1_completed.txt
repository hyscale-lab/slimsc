Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun. Its radius is the same as the Sun's, so R_star = R_sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K. Because the star is rotating, these spots will come into and go out of view, causing brightness variations that look like those from an exoplanet transit. The task is to find what exoplanet radius would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots. So, if the star didn't have spots, what planet radius would it take to make the same signal?

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait no, the question says: to produce the same amplitude signal as the spots do, what exoplanet radius is needed relative to the star's radius. So, the star's brightness changes because of the spots, and we want to find the planet radius that would do the same.

First, let's think about how the star's brightness varies when spots are present. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the facing side (the hemisphere facing us), the star appears dimmer. When the spots rotate away, the star is brighter. So, the brightness variation is due to the spots blocking the hotter parts of the star and showing the cooler spots.

But wait, no. The spots are dark, so when a spot is on the side facing us, it's blocking the light. Wait, but the spots are on the surface, so when a spot is facing us, it's a cooler area, so the star appears dimmer. When the spot is not facing us, more of the star's hotter surface is visible, so the star is brighter. So the brightness variation is a dip when spots are visible and a rise when they're not. The amplitude of this dip is what we're considering.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So the change in brightness is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness observed.

Alternatively, when the spots are on the far side, the star appears brighter because all the hotter parts are visible. When the spots are on the front, the cooler spots make the star dimmer. The variation is the difference between these two.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view. The brightness will dip each time a spot comes into view.

But the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. Because when a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. So, the brightness variation due to the spots is similar to the dip from a planet transit.

So the problem is asking: what is the radius of a planet that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do. Then, we can compare the two scenarios.

So, let's model both scenarios: the star with spots and the planet transit.

First, let's compute the brightness variation caused by the spots.

The star's total brightness is determined by its luminosity. The star's luminosity without any spots is L = 4πR_star^2 σ Teff^4.

But when spots are present, the observed luminosity varies depending on how much of the star is covered by spots.

The problem states that the hemisphere is covered with spots having a filling factor of 20%. Wait, fill factor (f) is the fraction of the visible hemisphere covered by spots. So, in this case, f = 0.2.

Wait, but the star's rotation would bring the spots into view. Since it's one hemisphere, the spots are on one side. When the star rotates, this hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. So, the brightness variation would be maximum when all the spots are facing us (the hemisphere is fully in view), and minimum when the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere. If spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view. So the brightness would dip when spots are visible and rise when they're not.

But wait, the problem says "only one hemisphere is spotty." So, the other hemisphere is spot-free and at the star's Teff. So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, causing a dip in brightness, and when it's the other hemisphere, the brightness is higher.

So, the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, but the star is a sphere. When the star is viewed from Earth, the hemisphere we see at any time is the one facing us. So, if the star has a hemisphere covered with spots, then when that hemisphere is facing us, the brightness drops. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us, so the brightness increases.

Thus, the total brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

So, the observed flux (F) when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spots = F_star * (1 - f + f*(T_spot^4 / T_star^4)).

Because the spots are cooler, each spot contributes less flux. So, the total flux during the spot phase would be the normal flux (without spots) multiplied by (1 - f + f*(T_spot^4 / T_star^4)).

Wait, but let me think again. The filling factor f is the area of the spots over the hemisphere. So, the total flux when the hemisphere is spotted is F = F0 * (1 - f) * (Teff^4 / Teff^4) + F0 * f * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4). Wait, no. Because the star's total flux is F0 = σ Teff^4. So, when a part of the star is at T_spot, the flux from that area is σ T_spot^4.

So, the total flux would be:

F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot,

where F0 is the flux per unit area, which is σ Teff^4, and F_spot is σ (T_spot)^4.

Wait, no. Because F0 is the flux per unit area of the star's surface. So, the total flux from the star when a fraction f of the hemisphere is covered by spots is:

F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

But wait, the hemisphere is half the star's surface. So, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire star's surface we see is that hemisphere, which is 50% of the star's surface. So, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted part and the unspotted part of the hemisphere.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's approach this systematically.

The entire star's surface is 4π R^2. The hemisphere facing us is 2π R^2.

But when a star is viewed from Earth, only a hemisphere is visible (assuming it's not limb darkened, but I think we can ignore that for this calculation). So, the observed flux is the sum of the flux from the visible hemisphere.

The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. One is covered in spots, the other is not.

When the star is in a position where the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions on that hemisphere. The unspotted regions on the spotty hemisphere are at Teff, and the spotted regions are cooler.

The other hemisphere is entirely at Teff, but when it's facing us, it's the maximum flux.

Wait, no. The other hemisphere is not spotty. So, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in view. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, so all the visible surface is at Teff. Hence, the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotty hemisphere is in view, and the minimum when the spotty hemisphere is in view.

So, the maximum flux F_max is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible. The flux from that hemisphere is 2π R^2 * σ Teff^4.

The minimum flux F_min occurs when the spotty hemisphere is visible. Let's compute that.

The spotty hemisphere has a filling factor f=0.2, which means 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. So, the area of the spotty hemisphere is 2π R^2. The spots cover f * 2π R^2 = 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface area covered by spots. So, the area of the spotty regions is f * (2π R^2) = 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

The rest of the hemisphere is unspotted, which is (1 - f) * 2π R^2 = 0.8 * 2π R^2 = 1.6 π R^2.

So, the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_spots = (flux from unspotted part of hemisphere) + (flux from spotted part)

= (1.6 π R^2) * σ Teff^4 + (0.4 π R^2) * σ T_spot^4.

Similarly, the flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_non_spots = 2π R^2 * σ Teff^4.

The difference in flux (the amplitude of the variation) is F_max - F_min, where F_max is F_non_spots and F_min is F_spots.

Wait, no. No, because when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, it's the maximum flux, and when the spotty hemisphere is visible, it's the minimum. So, the amplitude would be (F_max - F_min) / F_max, perhaps, as a relative change.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness. So, the amplitude A is F_max - F_min.

Wait, let me compute F_max and F_min.

F_max = 2π R^2 σ Teff^4.

F_min = (1.6 π R^2) σ Teff^4 + (0.4 π R^2) σ (Teff - 1000)^4.

Wait, no. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K.

So, F_min = (0.8 * 2π R^2) * σ Teff^4 + (0.2 * 2π R^2) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, 2π R^2 is the area of the hemisphere. So, when the spotty hemisphere is visible:

Unspotted area: (1 - f) * 2π R^2 = 0.8 * 2π R^2 = 1.6 π R^2.

Spotted area: f * 2π R^2 = 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

So,

F_min = (1.6 π R^2) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R^2) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, no, wait. No, when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the unspotted parts of that hemisphere are at Teff (6000 K), and the spotted parts are at T_spot (5000 K).

So, F_min = [ (1-f) * 2π R^2 * σ Teff^4 ] + [ f * 2π R^2 * σ T_spot^4 ].

So, F_min = 2π R^2 σ [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ].

Similarly, F_max = 2π R^2 σ Teff^4.

So, the amplitude A = F_max - F_min = 2π R^2 σ Teff^4 [ 1 - ( (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ].

Simplify this.

A = 2π R^2 σ Teff^4 [ 1 - (1-f) - f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ].

Which simplifies to:

A = 2π R^2 σ Teff^4 [ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ].

So,

A = 2π R^2 σ f Teff^4 [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ].

Now, let's compute the relative change in flux, which is A / F_max.

But wait, the planet transit would cause a dip in flux. The amplitude of that dip is when the planet is in front of the star, blocking some of the star's light. The dip is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star.

Wait, the dip in brightness (planet scenario) is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is π R_planet^2, and the star's area is π R_star^2 (as seen from Earth, but since the planet can only block the hemisphere, wait, no. Wait, the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk, which is (R_planet / R_star)^2 of the star's disk, because the star's disk as seen from Earth is π R_star^2, and the planet's disk is π R_planet^2. So, the fraction is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Wait, no, because the star's surface area is 4π R_star^2, but from Earth, you only see the hemisphere, which is 2π R_star^2. So, when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the hemisphere. So, the area blocked is π (R_planet)^2, which is a fraction [ π R_planet^2 / (2π R_star^2) ] = (R_planet^2) / (2 R_star^2).

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when a planet transits, it blocks a circular area on the star's disk. The area of the star's disk is π R_star^2. The area blocked is π R_planet^2. So, the fraction is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Wait, but from Earth, when you observe a transit, you see the star's disk as a circle with radius R_star. The planet's disk has radius R_planet, so the area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2 of the star's disk. So, the dip in brightness is that fraction.

So, the dip ΔF_planet would be F_max_planet - F_min_planet = F_max_planet * (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Wait, because F_max_planet is when no part of the planet is blocking. F_min_planet is when the planet is fully in front, blocking an area (R_planet/R_star)^2 of the star's light. So, the dip is F_max_planet * (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So, the amplitude for the planet is A_planet = F_planet_max * (R_planet / R_star)^2.

In the spot scenario, the amplitude is A_spots = 2π R^2 σ f Teff^4 [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ].

But wait, our F_max for the star is 2π R^2 σ Teff^4. So, A_spots = F_max * [ something ].

Wait, let me compute A_spots again.

Earlier, I had:

A_spots = F_max - F_min = 2π R^2 σ Teff^4 [ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ].

So,

A_spots = F_max * [ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ].

Wait, F_max is 2π R^2 σ Teff^4, so when you compute A_spots, it's F_max multiplied by f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

So, the amplitude from the spots is A_spots = F_max * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

The amplitude from the planet is A_planet = F_max * (R_planet / R_star)^2.

We want A_planet = A_spots.

So,

F_max * (R_planet / R_star)^2 = F_max * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

We can cancel F_max from both sides.

So,

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

Take the square root of both sides:

R_planet / R_star = sqrt[ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ].

Now, plug in the numbers.

f = 0.2.

Teff = 6000 K.

T_spot = 5000 K.

So,

Compute (T_spot / Teff)^4.

(5000 / 6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333333.

(0.8333333)^4 ≈ let's compute that.

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.694444.

(25/36)^2 = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So, T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So, 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ≈ 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

Take the square root: sqrt(0.10355) ≈ let's compute.

What's sqrt(0.1) ? Approximately 0.3162.

0.10355 is about 0.0355 above 0.1. Let's compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.32^2 = 0.1024. That's 0.32 * 0.32 = 0.1024.

0.32^2 = 0.1024.

0.322^2 = 0.32^2 + 2*(0.32)*0.002 + (0.002)^2 = 0.1024 + 0.00128 + 0.000004 ≈ 0.103684.

Which is just a bit above our 0.10355.

So, sqrt(0.10355) ≈ approximately 0.322.

Wait, but 0.322^2 is 0.103684, which is a bit higher than 0.10355. Let's try 0.3218^2:

0.3218 * 0.3218.

Compute 0.32^2 = 0.1024.

0.0018^2 is 0.00000324.

And cross terms: 2 * 0.32 * 0.0018 = 0.001152.

So, total is 0.1024 + 0.001152 + 0.00000324 ≈ 0.103555. Oh, that's exactly our number. So sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So, R_planet / R_star ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, the closest value is option D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the formula I derived was R_planet / R_star = sqrt( f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) )

Plugging in the numbers:

f=0.2, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1-0.482253 = 0.517747.

0.2 *0.517747 = 0.10355.

sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is ~0.32.

So option D) is 0.32.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So D is 0.32, which matches.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the spots cause a dimming, and the planet would cause a similar dimming. So the planet's radius would have to be such that the area it blocks ( (R_planet/R_star)^2 ) is equal to the fractional change in flux caused by the spots.

Wait, but in the spot scenario, the flux variation is due to the change in the star's brightness. The planet causes a dip in the flux because it blocks some of the star's light. So, the dip in the planet case is (R_planet/R_star)^2, and the dip in the spot case is f*(1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in equating the two amplitudes.

Wait, the brightness variation due to the spots is a dip of A_spots = F_max - F_min.

The brightness variation due to the planet is a dip of A_planet = F_max * (R_planet/R_star)^2.

We set A_planet = A_spots.

So,

F_max * (R_planet/R_star)^2 = F_max * [ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ]

Which leads to (R_planet/R_star)^2 = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

Which is correct.

So, the calculation seems right.

So the answer should be D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the star with dark spots, we analyze the brightness changes caused by both the spots and the planet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor \( f = 0.2 \).
   - Temperature of the spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_{\text{max}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots:
     \[
     F_{\text{min}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ (1-f) T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right].
     \]
   - The amplitude of brightness variation is:
     \[
     A_{\text{spots}} = F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot f \left( 1 - \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \right).
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation Due to a Planet**:
   - A planet transiting the star blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the planet's area relative to the star's visible hemisphere:
     \[
     A_{\text{planet}} = F_{\text{max}} \cdot \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]

4. **Equating the Amplitudes**:
   - To produce the same brightness variation, set \( A_{\text{planet}} = A_{\text{spots}} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = f \left( 1 - \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \right).
     \]
   - Taking the square root:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{f \left( 1 - \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \right)}.
     \]

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \):
   \[
   \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.482253.
   \]
   \[
   1 - \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \approx 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.
   \]

2. Multiply by \( f = 0.2 \):
   \[
   f \left( 1 - \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \right) = 0.2 \cdot 0.517747 \approx 0.10355.
   \]

3. Take the square root:
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option **D**.

**Answer: D**
