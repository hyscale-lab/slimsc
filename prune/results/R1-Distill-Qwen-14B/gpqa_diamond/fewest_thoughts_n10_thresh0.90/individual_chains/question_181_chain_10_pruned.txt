Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, particularly the proton-proton (pp) chains. I think there are different branches of the pp chain, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh wait, right, the pp-III branch is one of the main contributors to the Sun's energy, especially in regions where the temperature is high enough.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago. Oh wait, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if the pp-III stops, it would mean that the neutrinos produced in that process won't reach us for around 8.5 minutes. But the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands right now, so the flux from pp-III would drop to zero, but the other sources would still contribute.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of flux in two bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, the flux from pp-III in these bands would be zero now, but what about the other branches?

Wait, no. I think each branch produces neutrinos with different energies. For example, the pp-I and pp-II branches produce lower energy neutrinos, while pp-III produces higher energy ones. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think: the pp-III process involves reactions that produce higher-energy particles, so the neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy. 

So, if pp-III stops, its contribution to high-energy neutrinos (like in band 2, 800-900 keV) would suddenly drop. But wait, band 1 is 700-800 keV. So, maybe some of the neutrinos in band 1 are from pp-III, but perhaps others are from other processes.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall the neutrino energies from each process. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos. The pp-I branch produces a lot of neutrinos, but I think they are lower in energy. The pp-II and pp-III branches produce higher-energy neutrinos. Oh wait, no, maybe the main neutrino emission comes from the CNO cycle and the pp chain. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember that the standard solar model predicts that about 99% of the Sun's energy comes from the proton-proton chain, and a small fraction (like 1%) from the CNO cycle. But within the pp chain, there are different branches, including the pp-III which contributes a certain amount.

Wait, another approach: when the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos from that process won't be produced anymore. So, the flux from pp-III would drop, but other sources (like pp-I, pp-II, and CNO) would continue as before.

But the question is about the flux ratio between two bands. So, which bands are affected by pp-III stopping?

I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have higher energies compared to the pp-I and pp-II branches. So, if the pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like in band 2, 800-900 keV) would have a significant drop, whereas lower bands (like 700-800) might still have a significant contribution from other branches.

Wait, but neutrinos from the pp chain (including all branches) are monoenergetic? Or does each branch produce a spread of energies? No, I think each individual reaction produces a specific neutrino energy. For example, in the proton-proton chain, one of the steps is the beta-plus decay of beryllium-7 to carbon-7, which emits a neutrino of about 425 keV. So neutrinos from the pp chain are mostly around 400 keV or so. But wait, maybe there are other processes that contribute to higher energies.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the processes. Let me think. In the pp-III branch, higher temperatures allow for more energetic reactions. For example, the triple-alpha process occurs at higher temperatures, but that's more for helium burning. Wait, no, the triple-alpha is part of the CNO cycle? Or is that a separate process?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the neutrino energies. The main neutrinos from the pp chain are around ~400 keV. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, up to a few MeV perhaps. Oh wait, right, the CNO neutrinos are higher energy. So, for example, the CNO cycle produces neutrinos with energies up to about 16 MeV. But the pp chain
