Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 is 1.5 * R2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Interesting, same scaling for both radius and mass.

They did spectroscopy and found the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, right? Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature. The exact formula is λ_max * T = constant (like 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1*T1 = λ2*T2, and λ1=λ2, so T1 must equal T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but what if their masses and radii are different? Oh, but since their temperatures are the same, that must mean that their other properties affect their luminosity in a way that depends on their size, temperature, and maybe their masses, but wait, how does mass tie into this?

Wait, the question is about luminosity. I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a perfect black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature. 

Since both stars have the same temperature, T, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)². Because T cancels out when taking the ratio. 

So R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. But wait, that's assuming both stars have the same T. But wait, the problem also gives radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that factor in?

Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect the luminosity? Oh, wait, maybe it's about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength. But the problem stated that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (the λ_max) are the same. So that must be the observed wavelength. But if the stars are moving, the observed λ_max would be different from the emitted one.

Wait, so let me think again. The emitted λ_max depends on the star's temperature. But if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is Doppler shifted. So the observed λ is λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) ), if using the relativistic Doppler formula. Or for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted (1 + v_r / c) when moving away (v_r is positive when moving away). 

But in this problem, Star_1 has v_r=0, so its observed λ is the same as the emitted λ. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ_max are the same for both stars. So the observed λ for Star_1 is λ1, which is emitted λ1. For Star_2, the observed λ2 is Doppler shifted, but the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So:

λ1_obs = λ1_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r2 / c) / (1 - v_r2 / c) ) )

Wait, no. Because if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). But Star_1 is not moving, so its observed wavelength is the same as emitted. So, for both stars, λ_obs is the same. So Star_2's emitted wavelength must be shorter, because its light is redshifted to match Star_1's observed λ_max.

So let me think: For Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_emit. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + (v_r2)/c), approximately, since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s). So v_r2 is 700 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333... So the fractional change is about 0.233%.

Wait, but maybe it's better to write the exact Doppler effect formula. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ). But since v_r is 700 km/s, which is much less than c (3e5 km/s), we can approximate this as λ_emit ≈ λ_obs * (1 - v_r / c ). Wait, no, because when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so maybe the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r / c ). 

Alternatively, the non-relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is positive when moving away.

But perhaps let's model it as:

For Star_2: observed λ2 = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But the problem says that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But from Wien's law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So for each star, λ_emit = b / T.

So for Star_1: λ1_emit = b / T1.

For Star_2: λ2_emit = b / T2.

But from the Doppler shift condition, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2/c )

Substituting, b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

We can cancel b:

1/(T1) = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Hmm, but wait, since v_r2 is positive, T1 would be lower than T2. That's interesting.

But earlier, I thought that T1 and T2 were the same because the observed λ_max are the same. But that's not the case. Because the observed λ_max is the same, but the emitted λ_max depends on temperature, and the Doppler shift changes the observed wavelength.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:

The observed λ_max for each star is the same. So for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ_emit_1, since it's not moving. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ_emit_2 * Doppler factor.

But from Wien's law, λ_emit_1 = b / T1.

Similarly, λ_emit_2 = b / T2.

So:

λ1_obs = λ_emit_1 = b / T1.

λ2_obs = λ_emit_2 * Doppler_factor = (b / T2) * Doppler_factor.

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * Doppler_factor.

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler_factor.

So T1 = T2 / Doppler_factor.

What's the Doppler_factor? It's the factor by which the wavelength is stretched due to the star moving away. So for Star_2, moving away (v_r positive), the observed λ is longer than emitted, so Doppler_factor = (1 + v_r2 / c ), approximately.

So:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Thus, T1 is less than T2 because the denominator is greater than 1.

But wait, the problem says that the luminosities are being compared, so I need to find L1 / L2.

The luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

And T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So T1^4 = (T2^4) / (1 + v_r
