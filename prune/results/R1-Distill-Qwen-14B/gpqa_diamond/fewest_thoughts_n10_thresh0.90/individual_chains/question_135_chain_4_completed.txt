Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the bosonic field X and its possible decay channels. I remember that in particle physics, bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? The Lagrangian given is something like L = -λf ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So X is interacting with fermions.

Wait, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to find out into which fermion pairs X can decay. The key thing here is the conservation of energy and the mass of the fermions involved. Because for a decay to happen, the mass of X should be at least twice the mass of the heaviest fermion in the pair.

So first, I should list the possible fermions that the X boson can decay into. Let me think about the known fermions and their masses. The fermions include quarks of different flavors and leptons.

The quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). And the leptons: electron (e), muon (mu), tau (tau), and their respective neutrinos. But wait, neutrinos are super light, but since X is a boson and the interaction is with fermions, maybe it's considering charged leptons here, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the Lagrangian given has ψ_f, which I think refers to fermions. So in the interaction term, X is coupling to fermions. So the possible decay products would be any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to the mass of X.

So X's mass is 6 GeV. Let me jot down the masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (mu): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, like 173 GeV, but that's way beyond X's mass.

Wait, so the top quark is way too heavy. So X can't decay into top quarks.

Now, looking at the possible fermions:

For each fermion pair, the minimum mass required is 2 * fermion mass.

So for X (6 GeV) to decay into a pair, each fermion in the pair must have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV).

But let's see the individual masses:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → 2e would need 0.001 GeV. So possible.
- mu: ~0.105 → 0.21 GeV. Also possible.
- tau: 1.78 → 3.56 GeV. Wait, that's more than 6 GeV? No, wait wait. Wait, wait, no: 2m for tau is 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV. Wait, no, wait: the mass of the tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2m would be 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

Wait, but 1.78 * 2 = 3.56 GeV. Yes, so X can decay into tau pairs.

What about the bottom quark? Its mass is about 4.13 GeV. So 2mb is 8.26 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b bbar.

Wait, wait, no, wait. X's mass is 6 GeV. So, the maximum mass each fermion can have is 3 GeV because 2m ≤ 6. So if a fermion is m ≤3 GeV, it's allowed.

So let's list the possible fermions:

Electron: yes (mass 0.0005)
Muon: yes (0.105)
Tau: 1.78 → yes, since 1.78 < 3 GeV.

Quarks:

u: 0.003 → yes.
d: 0.004 → yes.
s: 0.095 → yes.
c: 1.275 → yes.
b: 4.13 → no, since 4.13 >3.

So possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

So X can decay into any of the pairs: u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, tau taū, e ē, mu mū.

Wait, but wait, what about the tau? Because 2m tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → b b̄: No, because 2m_b=8.26 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.

X → t t̄: No, m_t is way higher.

So, the decay options are:

b b̄ → no.

So the options are:

u, d, s, c, tau, e, mu.

Now, looking at the given options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau, e+ e-. So includes b, which isn't allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So includes c, which is allowed. But does the X have enough mass for c cbar? Because 2m_c is 2.55 GeV (since m_c is about 1.275 GeV). Yes, that's within 6 GeV.

So option B includes c, which is allowed.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, t tbar, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy. So C is wrong.

Option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e pairs. But b is too heavy, so D is wrong.

Wait, but wait, the options are different.

Wait let me read the options again.

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau, e+ e-.

So A includes b, which can't happen. So A is invalid.

Option B: X→c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e.

Wait no, let me look again.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, no: the question's options are a bit unclear.

Wait, the options are:

A) X → b, s, u, d, tau, e

B) X → c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e

C) X → c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e

D) X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, so in option B, the possible decay products are c cbar, s sbar, u ū, d d̄, tau taū, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So that's all allowed except for any fermion with mass more than 3 GeV. Since c is 1.275 GeV, which is fine.

So option B seems to include all the allowed decay channels except for the top, which isn't included. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but what about the tau? Let me check their masses again. Tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2 times that is ~3.56 GeV, which is less than X's mass of 6 GeV. So tau is allowed.

So which options include the tau? All except option A and D (no, D does include tau). Wait, no, let me check:

Option A includes tau.

Option B includes tau.

Option C includes tau.

Option D includes tau.

Wait, but the issue is whether the fermion is allowed.

So, what about the quarks in each option.

Option B: allows c cbar. Yes, because 2 * 1.275 ~2.55 <6 GeV.

Option D: allows b bbar. No, because 2 *4.13>6. So in D, that's a problem.

So, looking at the allowed decays, the correct options are those that include the possible fermion pairs and exclude those that are too heavy.

So options A includes b, which is not allowed.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All their masses are within 3 GeV, so 2m <=6 GeV. So this is correct.

Wait, but what about the s sbar? The strange quark is about 0.095 GeV. So 2*0.095=0.19 GeV, well under 6 GeV. So s is allowed.

So the correct decay channels are all the light quarks (u, d, s, c), the tau lepton, and the charged leptons (e, mu, tau).

Wait, but what about the tau in terms of X's mass. Since X is 6 GeV, tau's 2m is 3.56, which is less than 6, so allowed.

So, looking at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all correct.

Wait, but in the given options, option B is:

B) X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ū, d dbar, tau tau, mu mu, e e.

Yes, that's all allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction is described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left(\upsilon + X(y)\right)\psi_f(y),
\]

where \( X \) couples to fermions. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to occur, the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion \( f \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the maximum mass of a fermion \( f \) allowed is \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Electron (\( e \)):** \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
2. **Muon (\( \mu \)):** \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
3. **Tau (\( \tau \)):** \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
4. **Up quark (\( u \)):** \( m_u \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
5. **Down quark (\( d \)):** \( m_d \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
6. **Strange quark (\( s \)):** \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
7. **Charm quark (\( c \)):** \( m_c \approx 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.55 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \)):** \( m_b \approx 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 8.26 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, exceeds \( m_X \)).
9. **Top quark (\( t \)):** \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, far exceeds \( m_X \)).

Thus, the allowed decays are into the following fermion-antifermion pairs: \( e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > m_X \). **Incorrect.**
- **Option B:** Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct.**
- **Option C:** Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > m_X \). **Incorrect.**
- **Option D:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > m_X \). **Incorrect.**

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
