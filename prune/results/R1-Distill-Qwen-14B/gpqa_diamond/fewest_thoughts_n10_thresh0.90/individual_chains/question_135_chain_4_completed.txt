Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson particle. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, but I need to focus on the decay possibilities. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermions that X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a particle to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because, you know, energy and mass are related through E=mc². So the boson's mass has to be equal to or greater than twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Otherwise, the decay isn't kinematically allowed.

So, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. That means each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with a mass higher than 3 GeV can't be part of the decay products.

Now, I need to think about the masses of the known fermions. Let's list them out:

- Up quark (u): very light, like around 2 MeV (so way below 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): also light, maybe 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): super heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e-): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ-): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ-): ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos: extremely light, negligible mass.

Wait, but wait. The decay products are pairs of particles and their antiparticles. So for example, X can decay into e+ e- or μ+ μ-, etc.

Let me go through each option and see which fermions are allowed.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b quarks have a mass around 4.5 GeV. So 2*m_b is about 9 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV. So any option with b quark decays is automatically incorrect. So options A and D are out because they include b quarks.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

c quark mass is ~1.5 GeV. 2*1.5 =3 GeV. So 6 GeV is more than enough for c cbar.

Tau is ~1.777 GeV. 2*tau is ~3.55 GeV. Wait, 3.55 is more than 3 GeV. Because X is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So 3.55 would be higher than 3 GeV, so tau pair would not be allowed. Wait wait, no. Wait, the mass of the tau is ~1.777 GeV. So twice that is ~3.554 GeV. So 3.554 GeV is more than 3 GeV. But X is 6 GeV. Wait, wait, X is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV is more than 3.554 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau- because 6 > 3.554.

Wait, no, wait. Wait the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for the decay X → tau+ tau-, the sum of the rest masses of the tau pair is 2*m_tau = ~3.55 GeV. Since 6 GeV is larger than 3.55 GeV, it's allowed. So tau pair is allowed. So option B includes that.

Wait, but let me check each fermion in option B:

c: 1.5 GeV → 2*1.5=3 GeV. 6 GeV >=3, allowed.

s: ~0.1 GeV → 2*0.1=0.2, allowed.

u: 2 MeV → allowed.

d: ~5 MeV → allowed.

tau: ~1.777 GeV → 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6, so allowed.

mu: 0.105 GeV → 0.21, allowed.

e: 0.000511 GeV → allowed.

So all the fermions in option B are allowed.

Option C: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait t quark is about 173 GeV. 2*m_t is 346 GeV. X is 6 GeV, way less than that. So t tbar decay is not allowed. So option C is incorrect because it includes t.

Hmm, but looking back at the options, option C has t and tau etc. So it's incorrect.

So from the options, only option B is left.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Another approach: what's the maximum mass of the fermion pair that X can decay into?

X mass is 6 GeV, so maximum allowed per fermion is 3 GeV.

Which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

c quark: ~1.5 GeV → yes.

s quark: ~0.1 GeV → yes.

u, d: yes.

tau: ~1.777 GeV → yes.

mu: 0.105 GeV → yes.

e: yes.

But what about the b quark? m_b ≈4.5 GeV → 2*m_b = 9 GeV, which is much higher than X's 6 GeV. So b quarks are out.

What about the charm quark? 1.5 GeV is under 3, so okay.

So looking at the options, the allowed decay products are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Which is exactly what option B has. So option B is correct.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we use the rule that the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it decays into. This ensures energy conservation. The allowed decay products are those fermions (and their antiparticles) with individual masses \( m_f \) satisfying \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or equivalently \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
2. **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 10 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
3. **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 200 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
4. **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
5. **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
6. **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
7. **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 1.022 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
8. **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
9. **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Contains \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\), and \( e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decay products of the boson \( X \) are \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \) and \( e^+e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
