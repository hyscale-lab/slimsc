Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Oh wait, muon is a lepton, similar to an electron, but heavier. But the specifics of that might not matter for this problem.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, denoted as A_y = c·S. The constant c is given as h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So I need to figure out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Also, during the calculation, one of the given statements (A to D) is correct.

First things first, I should write down the matrix Ay. Let's compute that. So c is h/(4π), and S is:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So multiplying S by c, each element of S gets multiplied by c. So Ay = c*S would be:

Ay = [[0, -i c],
      [i c, 0]]

Substituting c = h/(4π), so let's compute those terms. i is the imaginary unit, right? So the matrix becomes:

Ay = [[0, (-i)(h/(4π))],
      [(i)(h/(4π)), 0]]

Simplify that. Hmm, but wait, let me think about the units. Oh, I don't think the units matter for the eigenvalues here since the problem is more about the structure.

So, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so the determinant will be straightforward.

Let me write down the matrix (Ay - a I):

[[-a, (-i h)/(4π)],
[(i h)/(4π), -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

Compute each part. The diagonal product is a². The off-diagonal product: (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)).

Let me compute that: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So the off-diagonal product becomes (h²/(16 π²)) * 1. So the determinant equation is:

a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0

So, a² = h²/(16 π²)
Which means a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). But wait, let me double-check the calculation. Because the off-diagonal terms are complex, but when you multiply them, it's i squared, which is -1, but let's recheck.

Wait, the off-diagonal terms are (-i c) and (i c), so their product is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (-i²) c². Since i² is -1, that's (-(-1)) c² = 1 * c². So yes, the product is positive c². So the determinant equation is a² - c² = 0, leading to a = ±c. Which is ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers. Because when I computed the determinant, I ended up with a real equation for a, giving real roots. So the eigenvalues of Ay are real, ±h/(4π).

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh and the real part is ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because our eigenvalues are purely real. So the imaginary part should be zero. So option A is incorrect because it implies complex eigenvalues, which isn't the case.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm. No, because our eigenvalues are real. So B is incorrect for the same reason as A.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Let's think about that. The operator A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. In quantum mechanics, for spin-½ particles, the square of the angular momentum is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * 3 * (I think), but wait, actually, for spin, the square is s(s+1)ħ². Wait, but wait, muon is a spin-½ particle, so s=½. So A² would have eigenvalues (½)(½+1)ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

But since Ay is a component of A, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² as well, because A² commutes with all components of A. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it must also be an eigenstate of A². So option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. But the option also says they are not of Az. Hmm. Let me think. The eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But for Az, which is another component, the eigenfunctions of Ay and Az would generally not be the same, unless they form a common eigenbasis, which they don't for angular momentum components.

Wait, but eigenstates of Ay and Az would be different. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of Az. So the statement in Option C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So option C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions of the operator would be the eigenvectors, right. So if the operator is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions for Ay. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but let's think again about option D. The statement is: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." The matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) should form a basis for the vector space (which is 2-dimensional). So D's statement is correct.

Wait, so both options C and D seem correct. But that can't be, as it's a multiple-choice question. So I must have made a mistake in evaluating.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Well, I said that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So that part is correct. But why are they not eigenfunctions of Az? Because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something? Wait, the commutator of Ay and Az is i ħ A something? Let me think: for angular momentum, [Lx, Ly] = iħ Lz. So similar for the muon's angular momentum. So [Ay
