Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given in matrix form. Let's see what I remember.

So, the problem says that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h divided by 4π, right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So I can write down S as:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Then, Ay is c * S. So plugging in c = h/(4π), Ay becomes (h/(4π)) multiplied by that matrix.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I think I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix Ay. To find eigenvalues, I remember that I have to solve the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - λI) = 0, where λ are the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

Let me write out Ay first. So:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i],
                  [i, 0] ]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -(i h)/(4π)],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Wait, that's correct because each element is multiplied by c. So when I write Ay - λ I, it would be:

[ -λ, -(i h)/(4π) ],
[ (i h)/(4π), -λ ]

So the determinant would be (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π) ) * (-1) ] because the off-diagonal terms multiply and then subtract. Wait, no, the determinant is ad - bc. So a is (-λ), b is -(i h)/(4π), c is (i h)/(4π), and d is (-λ).

So determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-(i h)/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) ].

Wait, let's compute that. The first term is λ squared. The second term is [ ( -(i h)/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) ].

Multiply those two: (-i^2) (h^2)/(16 π²). Because i * i is i² = -1, and negative signs: (-i) * (i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. Wait, no, let me do it carefully.

Wait, the product is (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) )? Or wait, no. The off-diagonal elements are -(i h)/(4π) and (i h)/(4π). So when you multiply them, it's ( -(i h)/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) = -(i^2) (h^2)/(16 π²) )

Because i^2 is -1, so this becomes - ( (-1) ) (h^2)/(16 π²) ) = (h^2)/(16 π²).

So the determinant is λ² - (h^2)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

Wait, because the determinant equation is (λ^2) - [ ( (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] ?

Wait, no, because the determinant is (ad - bc). So a is -λ, d is -λ. So a d is λ².

bc is [ -(i h/(4π)) ] * [ i h/(4π) ].

Let me compute that: -(i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²). i times i is i² = -1, so -(i^2) is -(-1) = 1. So bc is [ -(i) ] * [ i ] = -(i^2) = -( -1 ) = 1. So bc is (h²)/(16 π²) multiplied by 1.

Wait no, bc is [ -(i h/(4π)) ] * [ i h/(4π) ] = -(i^2) (h²)/(16 π²) ) = - ( (-1) ) (h²)/(16 π²) ) = (h²)/(16 π²).

Oh wait, no, because the product is ( -i * i ) = -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is 1 * (h²)/(16 π²).

So bc = (h²)/(16 π²). So the determinant becomes λ² -
