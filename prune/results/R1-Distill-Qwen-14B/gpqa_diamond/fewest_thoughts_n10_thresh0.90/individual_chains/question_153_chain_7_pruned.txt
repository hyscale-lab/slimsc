Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to find the major products for each and match them with the given options.

Let's start with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. Under basic conditions (NaOEt), the malonate will deprotonate to form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH₂(COOEt)₂. When it loses a proton from the alpha carbon, it becomes a strong nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is probably CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group attached to the carbon next to the double bond. Wait, no, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or wait, no, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, which would be the middle of the double bond? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon, which is the same as the acrylate's structure. No, wait, maybe I'm misnumbering. The structure might be CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no. The formula for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be OCH2CH2C(p-tolyl)=CH2? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-configuration, so the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3, which is the same as the carbonyl group. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(O)OCH3 where the carbonyl carbon has a p-tolyl group attached. Wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH–CO–O–CH3, where the p-tolyl is attached to the alpha carbon. Wait, perhaps the acrylate is (E)-configured as CH₂=CH–CO–O–CH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3? Or maybe it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)prop-2-enoate. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the p-tolyl is on C3. So the structure would be CH₂=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3, but that doesn't fit because acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. Wait, perhaps it's more accurately written as (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is (E)-CH₂=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3? No, that's not right because acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-.

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is CH₂=C(CO-OCH3)(p-tolyl) where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has both the COOCH3 and p-tolyl groups. Oh wait, that would make it an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So, the structure would be CH₂=CH–C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the same carbon as the double bond. Wait, no, that can't be because that would make it CH₂=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the other end. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this, but maybe I can proceed.

In any case, the Michael addition involves the enolate attacking the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

The enolate of dimethyl malonate
