Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about Michael addition reactions. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. It's a conjugate addition, right? So the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, which then tautomerizes.

There are three separate reactions given, each producing a product A, B, and C. And I need to match these with the options provided. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It has two ester groups, so the enolate would form easily. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. That structure has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (assuming the numbering starts from the ester). So the acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, making it a good Michael acceptor.

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. So the nucleophile (from malonate) adds to the beta carbon, which is the third carbon of the acrylate. 

The acrylate is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. The attack would be on the CH2=CH-C part. Wait, no, the acrylate is actually CH2=CH-C-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the central carbon. So the central carbon is the one with the p-tolyl.

When dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(COOEt)2) forms its enolate, the enolate would be the conjugate base attacking the beta position of the acrylate. So the malonate's enolate would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 part of CH2=CH-C...), adding itself there.

So the product would be a new molecule where the malonate has added to the acrylate. Let me visualize this: the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. The attack occurs at the CH2, so the malonate's enolate (which is the conjugate base) adds to that position, resulting in a new carbon-carbon bond between the CH2 (now connected to the malonate) and the central carbon.

Wait, more accurately, the malonate's enolate would deprotonate and attack the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate). So the addition would be 1,4-addition (since the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the attack is on C3).

So the product would be a new compound where the malonate is attached to the acrylate. Let me think about the structure. The acrylate is E-configured, but when the addition happens, the geometry might not matter as much because the addition is conjugate.

After the addition, the product would have the malonate group attached to the acrylate's beta carbon. So the structure would be something like:

O
||
O-C-CH2-C(COOEt)2-OCH3 ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the same carbon as the OCH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3.

The Michael addition would add the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) to the beta position (the CH2 part). Wait, no, the beta position for the acrylate is the CH2=CH- part. So the structure after addition would have the malonate attached to the CH2, so the product would have a new carbon-carbon bond between the CH2 (from the acrylate) and the malonate.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. The acrylate has the structure: CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3. The Michael acceptor is the acrylate, and the nucleophile is the enolate of dimethyl malonate.

The enolate would attack the beta position (the CH2 part of the double bond). So the product would have the malonate attached to that CH2, and the double bond would shift. Let me think how that would look.

The addition would form a new single bond between the CH2 and the malonate. So the structure would become CH2–C(malonate)–CH–C(p-tolyl)OCH3, but wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, the addition would form a new bond between the CH2 and the malonate's carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a new compound where the dimethyl malonate has added to the double bond in a conjugate fashion. So the product would be something like CH2–CH(COOEt)2–C(p-tolyl)OCH3. But wait, that might not be correct. 

Wait, another approach. The Michael addition here would create a new carbon-carbon bond between the nucleophile and the beta carbon of the acceptor. So the acrylate is the acceptor (E-configuration), and the malonate's enolate is the nucleophile.

The product would have the structure where the malonate has added across the double bond, with the enolate attacking the beta carbon. So the product would be a gamma,delta-ester. Let me think: 

The acrylate (CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)OCH3) reacts with the enolate of dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(COOEt)2-). The enolate would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 part of the double bond), leading to the formation of a new single bond.

So the product would be CH2–CH–C(p-tolyl)OCH3 connected to the malonate. Wait, perhaps the
