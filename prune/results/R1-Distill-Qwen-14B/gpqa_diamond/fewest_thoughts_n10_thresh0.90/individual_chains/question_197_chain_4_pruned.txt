Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are in the regions of 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. Since there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be from aromatic C=C bonds, maybe indicating some conjugation. So putting that together, maybe the compound has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring with substituents.

Now the NMR data. Let's go through each peak:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which usually suggests an acidic proton. Maybe an aldehyde proton? Or perhaps a carboxylic acid? Wait, carboxylic acids typically have protons around 10-12 ppm as broad signals. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid group here. But wait, if it's a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde, maybe the 10.5 ppm isn't that. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but they're deshielded. But a carboxylic acid would be broader. Hmm. Alternatively, could it be an enol proton? Not sure yet.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and each couple with the adjacent protons. So maybe the structure is something like a para-substituted benzene, with substituents at the 1 and 4 positions.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, maybe a CH group attached to something else. Could be adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a substituent like a CH2CH2 group or maybe a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This could be a CH2 group that's part of a larger substituent. Perhaps next to another CH group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. Like a geminal group, maybe an isopropyl or some branched chain.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet of 3H, likely a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain. So maybe an ethyl group somewhere, like CH2CH3.

Putting the NMR together: So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. Then, the substituents would have a -COOH group (since the IR has a carbonyl and the NMR has a broad peak around 10.5 ppm). Wait, but wait, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700-1725, so that fits. But the broad peak at 10.5 would be the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the compound is a methyl ester or something else, maybe the O-H wouldn't be present. But in this case, the IR shows a broad peak in 3400-2500, which is consistent with O-H in a carboxylic acid. So perhaps compound X is a benzoic acid with substituents.

Looking at the NMR: The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So the substituent is at the para position, and the ring is probably 1,4-disubstituted. Let's say the substituent is a group attached to the benzene ring at position 4, and another group at position 1. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the substituents could be in the meta position, but the doublets suggest they're para, as each set of doublets is equivalent.

Wait, benzene with two substituents in para positions would show two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So the substituents are in positions 1 and 4. For example, a para-substituted benzene with a substituent in one position. Wait, no. If it's a single substituent in the para position, then the two protons next to it would be a doublet each. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent elsewhere? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the substituent could be a group that's attached to the ring and has branching.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a side chain. Let's think about the other NMR peaks. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to an oxygen or another group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to that. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, so perhaps an ethyl group.

Putting that together, the substituent on the benzene could be a propanoic acid group with a substituent. For example, maybe something like CH2CH2COOH, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group attached to the benzene? Or perhaps a longer chain. Let me think. Let's imagine the substituent is a group like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the reaction. The question says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a hydrohalogenation reaction, probably anti addition (maybe via the phosphonium intermediate). But wait, if the compound has a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid, maybe the reaction is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction is something like a Michael addition or a conjugate addition.

Wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, especially in a HPHI (Hot Phosphorus HI) reaction, which tends to give more substituted alkenes. Alternatively, they can be used for the dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a situation where a carbonyl group is involved in some way.

Wait, but if X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), reacting with HI and red phosphorus could lead to some kind of addition. For example, if X is a benzaldehyde, adding HI might form a benzyl phosphonate or something else, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzoic acid, and the reaction
