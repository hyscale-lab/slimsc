Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me start by understanding what I know about the starting material and the reagents involved.

First, the IR and NMR data for Compound X. Let's look at the IR first. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong and suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which might be aromatic C=C stretching, and 1450 cm-1 could be either aromatic ring deformation or possibly C-O stretching, but I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the 1H NMR data, I see a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet, which probably corresponds to an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. That makes sense because the IR shows a strong carbonyl. The aromatic region has peaks at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The coupling patterns (doublets) suggest that the two sets of protons are adjacent, so maybe two substituents on the benzene in the para positions.

Then, there's a triplet at 2.9 ppm, which is a bit tricky. Maybe it's a methylene group attached to something. The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to a branching point. The 1.4 ppm as a doublet (d, 3H) seems like a methyl group attached to something that's split into a doublet, maybe a CH(CH3) group. And the triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the aromatic part is a para-substituted benzene. The substituents seem to be a carboxylic acid group (from the IR and NMR) and another group that's more complex. Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton. The other groups on the ring must be something else, maybe an alkyl chain.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene could be a propanoic acid group. Because the IR has 1720 cm-1, which could be from a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid. So maybe the structure is something like para-substituted benzene with a propanoic acid group attached. But wait, looking at the NMR, there's a triplet at 2.9 ppm, which might be adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait another thought: The NMR shows a downfield shift for the aromatic protons. For a para-substituted benzene, if there are two substituents, perhaps one is a strong electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) and another is an electron-donating group. Or maybe it's a single substituent with a specific structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached in some way. Let me think about the NMR shifts. The triplet at 2.9 ppm, perhaps a CH2 group attached to something else. The 1.7 ppm might be another CH2, and the 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to a CH. So maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group?

Wait, let's reconstruct. The NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): probably -COOH.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons. So, para-substituted, with substituents at positions 1 and 4 (since it's para), so let's say substituents are at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene.

Wait, no, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the para substituents would be opposite each other. So perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents, one at position 1 and the other at position 4. But that might not make sense because the substituents would be across from each other, but each substituent would have different groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent isn't two substituents but a single group that's more complex, like a side chain attached at position 4, for example. Let's consider that.

Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H. Maybe that's a CH group attached to another CH2. So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in a way that the structure is something like CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH? Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider the substituent as a butyl group. The triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (t) of 3H, which is likely a methyl group at the end of a chain. So, perhaps a propyl or butyl chain.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. If the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene ring, perhaps as a side chain. So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a single bond, like benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2- something. But wait, the NMR has a 1.4 ppm as a doublet (d, 3H), which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So maybe it's a CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Hmm.

Putting this together, maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that is a propanoic acid group. But wait, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1 which is typical for a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid. In the NMR, 10.5 is a broad singlet, which fits a carboxylic acid proton. So the substituent could be a propiono group with a COOH.

Wait, if the substituent is a propanoic acid group attached directly to the benzene ring, like benzene-CH2-COOH. Then, that would account for the IR and the NMR. Let's check the NMR:

- The aromatic protons would be deshielded due to the substituent. The downfield shifts (8.0 and 7.2 ppm) make sense if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group. Propanoic acid substituents would cause that.

But wait, looking at the substituent's NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That could be the CH2 between the benzene and the carbonyl. Then, the 1.7 ppm multiplet (m, 2H) might be another CH2 group, but that doesn't fit. Wait, if it's benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, the protons on the CH2 groups would be in a certain pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a branched chain, like benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH, but that might complicate things.

Wait a second, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached to the ring. Let's think about the substituent as a butyl group with a branch. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a methyl group at the end of a chain. The 1.4 ppm as a doublet (d, 3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH(CH
