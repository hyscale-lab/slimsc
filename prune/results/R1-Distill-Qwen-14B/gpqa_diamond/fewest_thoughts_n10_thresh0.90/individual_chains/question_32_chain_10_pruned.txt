Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC colliders deal with heavy ions, so I need to figure out the energy based on the ion's speed.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, the atomic number of lithium is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A would be protons plus neutrons. Protons in Li are 3, so 3 +3 =6. So X is Li-6, right? So the mass is that of a Li-6 nucleus.

But wait, do I need the actual mass number or just the fact that it's a heavy ion? Hmm, probably the mass number is important for calculating the rest mass energy.

I think I should calculate the total energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c. The energy in relativity for a moving object is given by gamma times the rest energy, E=gamma * m c². So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So v is 0.96c. Let me calculate gamma. Let's plug in v=0.96c into the formula. So v² is (0.96)^2 c², so (0.96)^2 is about 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784), let's see, 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/(0.28) which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, more accurately, let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96: 0.9*0.9=0.81, 0.9*0.06*2=0.108, 0.06^2=0.0036. So 0.81 + 0.108=0.918, plus 0.0036 is 0.9216. Yeah, that's correct.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: I think 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Alternatively, 1/0.28 = 10/2.8 ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the rest energy is m c². But wait, the nucleus is a collection of nucleons, so I need to find the mass of the Li-6
