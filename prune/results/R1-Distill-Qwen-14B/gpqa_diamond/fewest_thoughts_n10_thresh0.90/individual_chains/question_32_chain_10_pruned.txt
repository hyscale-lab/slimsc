Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that's lithium-6 because Li usually has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number would be 6. So, X is Li-6.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic energy calculations, but let me remember the formulas. When dealing with particles moving at relativistic speeds, we use the concept of relativistic mass. The total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

Wait, right, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me plug in the numbers. 

v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So inside the square root, it's 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Hmm, 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so a total of 6 nucleons. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², I think. Similarly for a neutron. Wait, let's see: proton mass is about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron is around 939.565 MeV/c². But wait, wait—maybe I should just use the atomic mass for Li-6. Oh, right, because the nucleus's mass is the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons, considering binding energy, but I think in this problem, it's approximate. Alternatively, maybe using the atomic mass is better.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: the mass of the nucleus is the mass of the atom minus the electrons. But for heavy ions like Li-6, which is a light nucleus, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can approximate the mass as the sum of the individual nucleons. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact mass of Li
