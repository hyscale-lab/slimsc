Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M (that's 0.01 M), and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, wait a second. I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on. 

Wait, what are the complexes here? I think for Co(II) with SCN-, the complexes form stepwise. So the first complex would be CoSCN^+ (with β1), the second would be Co(SCN)_2^{2+} (β2), the third Co(SCN)_3^{3+} (β3), and the fourth Co(SCN)_4^{4+} (β4). But wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That's interesting because usually higher β would mean a more stable complex, but here β3 is the highest. So the most stable complex is the triply charged one, Co(SCN)_3^{3+}.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. So that would correspond to the second complex, which has β2=40. Or wait, maybe dithiocyanato could be the triply charged one? No, wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- attached. So the second complex is with two SCN-, so it's the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex. So β2 is 40.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The dithiocyanato complex would have two SCN- ions attached to Co^2+. So the formula would be Co(SCN)_2^{2+}, which is the second complex. So β2 is 40, which is the stability constant for this complex.

So the problem is asking for the percentage of this complex (the second one) among all the Co species present.

So the approach here is to calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex relative to all possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ion.

But first, I need to understand the formation of complexes. The general approach is to consider all possible complexes, write their formation equations, and then calculate their concentrations based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

Let me outline the species present:

1. Free Co^2+ (let's call this species A).
2. CoSCN^+ (species B) – formed by adding one SCN- to Co^2+.
3. Co(SCN)_2^{2+} (species C) – adding another SCN- to species B.
4. Co(SCN)_3^{3+} (species D) – adding another SCN- to species C.
5. Co(SCN)_4^{4+} (species E) – adding another SCN- to species D.

Wait, but wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the formation happens stepwise. So the overall formation constant for each step is as follows.

β1 is the formation constant for the first complex: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+; β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

β2 is the formation constant for the second complex: CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^{2+}; β2= [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-])=40.

Similarly, β3 is the formation constant for the third complex: Co(SCN)_2^{2+} + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^{3+}; β3=63.

β4 would be for the fourth complex: Co(SCN)_3^{3+} + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^{4+}; β4=16.

But wait, the β4 is given as 16, which is lower than β3. So the stability of the complexes increases up to β3 and then decreases for β4. Hmmm, but that might complicate things, because if β4 is lower, the formation of the fourth complex is less favored than the third.

So, the plan is to calculate the concentrations of each species (A, B, C, D, E) and find the ratio of [C] to the sum of all species.

But since the concentrations of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-] are given, and the stability constants are known, we can model the distribution.

Alternatively, since the problem is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which is the second complex, perhaps we can model the fraction using the stepwise formation constants.

Wait, but considering all the possible species might get complicated. Another approach is to use the formation of the complexes step by step, starting from Co^2+ and adding SCN^-.

But let me think about the general approach for such problems. When multiple complexes can form, the concentrations of each species can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The key is to set up the expressions for each species in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as [A], [CoSCN^+] as [B], [Co(SCN)_2^{2+}] as [C], [Co(SCN)_3^{3+}] as [D], and [Co(SCN)_4^{4+}] as [E].

Then, the first complex is B = β1 * [A] * [SCN]

The second complex, C, can be expressed as β2 * [B] * [SCN] = β2 * β1 [A] [SCN]^2.

Wait, but that's not exactly correct, because β2 is for the formation of C from B. So, [C] = β2 [B] [SCN^-] = β2 * β1 [A] [SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, [D] = β3 [C] [SCN^-] = β3 β2 β1 [A] [SCN^-]^3.

And [E] = β4 [D] [SCN^-] = β4 β3 β2 β1 [A] [SCN^-]^4.

But wait, that seems off. Because each β is for a step-wise addition, so the overall formation constant for each species is the product of the βs up to that point. So, for species C, the overall β is β1 * β2. For D, it's β1 * β2 * β3, etc.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first complex (B) has β1. The second complex (C) has a formation constant of β1 * β2 because it's formed by adding SCN^- to B. Similarly, D has β1 * β2 * β3, and E has β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, but in reality, β1 is the formation constant for the first step (Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+), β2 is the formation constant for the second step (CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2^{2+}), and so on.

So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n^(n+) would be the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The overall K for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^{2+n} is the product of β1, β2, ..., βn.

But in this case, β4 is for the fourth step, so the overall K for E would be β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

But wait, when we have stepwise formation constants, each β represents the formation of the next complex from the previous one plus an additional SCN^-.

In any case, the concentration of each species can be expressed in terms of [A] and the powers of [SCN^-].

So, let's write each concentration in terms of [A] and [SCN^-]^(n), where n is the number of SCN- added.

So,

[B] = β1 [A] [SCN^-]

[C] = β1 β2 [A] [SCN^-]^2

[D] = β1 β2 β3 [A] [SCN^-]^3

[E] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [A] [SCN^-]^4

But wait, the initial Co^2+ comes from the solution, but as complexes form, the free [Co^2+] will be reduced, so [A] is the free Co^2+ concentration.

Now, the total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. This is the sum of all Co species:

[A] + [B] + [C] + [D] + [E] = 1e-2 M.

We can write this sum as:

[A] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4) ) = 1e-2.

But we don't know [A], and [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M. But wait, [SCN^-] would be approximately 0.1 M because the concentration is high, and the amount taken up by the complexes might be negligible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can approximate [SCN^-] as 0.1 M because the amount taken up by complexes is small compared to the initial 0.1 M.

Wait, but let's think about it. The initial [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but each complex consumes some SCN^-.

In the solution, the total cobalt is 0.01 M, and each Co complex consumes n SCN^- for each complex. Let's compute how much SCN^- is consumed.

Assuming that the dominant complexes are the ones with higher β, which are C, D, etc., but let's see.

Wait, perhaps we can proceed by computing the terms and see if the [SCN^-] can be approximated as 0.1 M.

So let's compute the terms without considering the change in [SCN^-].

Compute each term in the sum:

1. 1
2. β1 * [SCN] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9
3. β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 9 *40 *0.01 = 9*0.4=3.6
4. β1 * β2 * β3 * [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63*(0.1)^3 = 9*40*63*0.001=9*40*0.063=9*2.52=22.68
5. β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * [SCN]^4 = 9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 = 9*40*63*16*0.0001.

Let me compute that: 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680*16=362880. Multiply by 0.0001: 362880 * 0.0001 =36.288.

Wait, so the terms are 1, 0.9, 3.6, 22.68, 36.288.

Adding them up: 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; 5.5 +22.68=28.18; 28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the sum is approximately 64.468.

So the equation becomes [A] * 64.468 ≈ 0.01.

So [A] ≈ 0.01 / 64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Now, what about the [SCN^-]?

The total [SCN] is 0.1 M initially, but each complex consumes SCN^-.

The total consumption is:

Each [B] consumes 1 SCN^- per mole of B.

Each [C] consumes 2 SCN^- per mole of C.

Each [D] consumes 3 SCN^- per mole of D.

Each [E] consumes 4 SCN^- per mole of E.

But wait, no, because each [B] is one mole of SCN^- per mole of B, each [C] is two moles of SCN^- per mole
