Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, but often approximated as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ. 

So, the uncertainty in energy depends on the lifetime of the state because the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be measured because there's more time to observe it, leading to a smaller uncertainty. Alternatively, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

The question is asking for the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two states. That means the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be based on their respective lifetimes. Let me think: for state E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2), where τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So we need the difference |E2 - E1| to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each's uncertainty? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the difference is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, we can resolve them. Let me think more.

Suppose the two states have different uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty (since ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so shorter τ means larger ΔE). So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished. Because even the state with the larger uncertainty would have a width that's less than the energy difference.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime. Because the uncertainty is larger for the shorter-lived state. So, if the energy difference is bigger than ΔE1, which is bigger than ΔE2, then the two states can be resolved.

So, let's compute the uncertainties. I'll need the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Then ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

So, for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. Hmm, but the options are given in eV. So I need to convert J to eV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 = 1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Wait, that's 6.58e-7 eV. That's 0.658e-6 eV, which is about 0.658 micro-eV.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1e-9 seconds is 1 nanosecond. So let's compute 1.055e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.055e-25 J. Then divide by 1.602e-19 to get eV: (1.055e-25)/(1.602e-19) = approx (1.055 / 1.602) * 1e-6 = 0.658 * 1e-6 eV. Yep, so about 6.58e-7 eV, or 0.658 micro-eV.

Similarly, for τ2 =1e-8 seconds, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV. That's 0.658e-7 eV, about 0.0658 micro-eV.

So the uncertainty for E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and for E2 it's about 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be clearly distinguishable. Or wait, wait. Because each state has its own uncertainty, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two? Hmm. Let me think about how energy resolution works.

In spectroscopy, for example, the resolving power depends on the energy spread. If two peaks are being observed, each with their own linewidths, the minimum energy difference between them for resolution is roughly the sum of their half-widths. So, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But in this case, the problem says "clearly distinguish these two energy levels." So the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Another approach: the uncertainty principle says that the time over which you measure the energy affects the uncertainty. So, the energy uncertainty for each state is based on their own lifetimes. But when you're trying to measure the difference between E2 and E1, perhaps you have a combined uncertainty?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of the shorter-lived state, because that's the larger uncertainty. Because if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, the two states will be separated by more than the width of the broader peak, making them distinguishable.

Wait, let's think of it this way. Suppose you have two states, E1 and E2. The lifetime of E1 is shorter, so it's broader in energy (larger ΔE). If the energy difference between E2 and E1 is greater than the ΔE of E1, then you can distinguish them. Because the ΔE of E2 is smaller, so the separation is larger than the broader line's width.

So, in this case, the energy difference must be larger than ΔE1, which is about 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1 n eV → much smaller than 6.58e-7. Can't be.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is 1e+3 times larger than 6.58e-7. So yes, it's larger. So this would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV → 1e-8 is about 1.5e+1 times smaller than 6.58e-7 (since 6.58e-7 ≈ 6.58e-7, 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, so 1e-8 is 1/65th of 1e-6, wait no, 6.58e-7 is 658e-9, and 1e-8 is 10e-9. So 658e-9 vs 10e-9. So 658e-9 is 65.8 times 10e-9. So 1e-8 is smaller than ΔE1. So that's too small.

So the options are C)1e-4 eV and others. Only C is larger than ΔE1.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), and the lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Converting the uncertainties to electron volts (eV) using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), we calculate:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is \( \Delta E_1 \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it also cannot resolve the two states.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much larger than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it can clearly resolve the two states.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
