Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star relates to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass is 1.5 times bigger, but wait, mass might not directly affect luminosity unless we're considering something like the mass-luminosity relation. But the question says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so probably we don't need mass for that part. Maybe the mass info is a red herring or for some other part.

Wait, the question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. So, if I can find the temperatures, I can compute the luminosity ratio.

They also mention that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). If the λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. So the temperatures are the same.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because then the luminosity ratio would just depend on their radius. Since L1 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. If T1 = T2, then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would make the factor 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but the question includes radial velocities. Oh right, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, what does radial velocity have to do with this? Oh, perhaps it's about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength?

Wait, but earlier I thought the observed wavelengths are the same. Or the peak wavelengths. Because the question says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So their observed λ_max are the same. But the actual emitted λ_max would depend on their rest frame temperatures.

So if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its observed λ_max would shift. So maybe the radial velocity affects the temperature calculation. Because the observed λ_max is due to Doppler shifting.

Wait, so the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let me think: the Doppler effect for light. The formula is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes it's approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c), but that's a first-order approximation. But given the velocities are 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.23% of c, but 700 is 7e5 m/s? Wait, no, 1e3 km/s is 1e6 m/s, so 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. C is 3e8 m/s, so 7e5 is about 0.0023c, so 0.23% the speed of light. So the approximation might be okay, but maybe I should use the relativistic formula.

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So for each star, the observed λ_max is the same. But their rest frame λ_max would be different if they have different velocities.

So let me model this. Let me denote the rest frame λ_max as λ1 and λ2 for Star_1 and Star_2.

We know that λ_obs,1 = λ1 (since Star_1 has v_r=0, so no Doppler shift). And λ_obs,2 = λ2 * Doppler shift factor.

But the problem says λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, because the observed wavelengths are same. So λ1 = λ2 * Doppler shift factor.

Wait, but the Doppler shift for Star_2 is due to its velocity. So let me write that.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the sign here. If the star is moving away from us, v_r is positive, and the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). If moving towards us, v_r is negative, and observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted).

In this case, Star_1 has v_r=0, so λ_obs,1 = λ1.

Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. Wait, but the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s—do we know if it's moving towards or away? The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. It doesn't specify direction, but probably v_r is positive for moving away.

Wait, but the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ_obs,2 = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

And we're told that λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2. So,

λ1 = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

But let's compute the Doppler factor.

v_r = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c is about 3e8 m/s.

So v_r/c is approximately 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333...

Now, the Doppler shift factor for wavelength is sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )

So let's compute that:

(1 + v/c) = 1 + 0.002333... = 1.002333...

(1 - v/c) = 0.997666...

So (1.002333)/(0.997666) ≈ (approx 1.00233) / (0.997666) ≈ let's compute that.

Wait, 1.00233 / 0.997666 ≈ 1.00467.

Wait, (1.002333)/(0.997666) = let me compute.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6: (1002333)/(997666) ≈ 1.004674.

So the square root of 1.004674 is approximately sqrt(1.004674) ≈ 1.002333.

Wait, because sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 when x is small. Here x=0.004674. So sqrt(1.004674) ≈ 1 + 0.004674/2 ≈ 1.002337. Which is about 1.002337. So the Doppler factor is approximately 1.002337.

So λ_obs,2 = λ2_rest * 1.002337.

But since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2,

λ1 = λ2_rest * 1.002337.

But λ1 is the rest wavelength of Star_1, and λ2_rest is the rest wavelength of Star_2.

Wait, but from Wien's law, λ_max = b / T.

So λ1 = b / T1

λ2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting,

b/T1 = (b / T2) * 1.002337.

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.002337.

So T1 = T2 / 1.002337.

Which is approximately T2 * (1 - 0.002337) ≈ T2 * 0.997663.

So T1 ≈ 0.997663 T2.

Wait, so the temperatures are not the same. So earlier assumption that T1=T2 is incorrect because Doppler shift affects the observed λ_max.

So now, let's compute the luminosity ratio.

L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We know R1/R2 = 1.5.

T1/T2 = 0.997663 ≈ approximately 0.99766.

So let's compute (0.99766)^4.

Compute 0.99766^4:

First, 0.99766 is approximately 1 - 0.00234.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4, where x is small.

x=0.00234.

So,

(1-4*0.00234) = 1 -0.00936 = 0.99064.

+6x²: 6*(0.00234)^2 = 6*(0.0000054756) ≈ 0.00003285.

-4x³: 4*(0.00234)^3 ≈ 4*(1.28e-8) ≈ 5.12e-8.

+x^4: negligible.

So adding up: 0.99064 + 0.00003285 ≈ 0.99067. The other terms are negligible.

So (0.99766)^4 ≈ 0.99067.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 0.99067.

1.5^2 is 2.25.

So 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99067.

Let me compute that: 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275. 2.25 * 0.00067 is about 0.0015075. So total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.0015075 ≈ 2.229.

So approximately 2.229. That's close to 2.23, which is option D.

Wait but let me be more precise. Let me compute (0.99766)^4 accurately.

Compute 0.99766 squared: 0.99766 * 0.99766.

Let me compute that:

0.99766 * 0.99766.

= (1 - 0.00234)^2

= 1 - 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2

= 1 - 0.00468 + 0.0000054756 ≈ 0.9953254756.

Then square that: (0.995325)^2.

= (1 - 0.0046745)^2

= 1 - 2*0.0046745 + (0.0046745)^2

= 1 - 0.009349 + 0.000021858

≈ 0.990671858.

So (0.99766)^4 ≈ 0.990671858.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * 0.990671858 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.229.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the formula for luminosity of a black body:

\[
L = 4\pi \sigma R^2 T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies, and their observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are the same. Using Wien's Law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant. The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

For Star_1, since its radial velocity \(v_r = 0\), \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\). For Star_2, with \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the Doppler factor is:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}} \approx \sqrt{1 + 2v_r/c} \quad \text{(for small \(v_r/c\))}
\]

Substituting \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + 700/300000}{1 - 700/300000}} \approx 1.002337
\]

Thus, the observed wavelength of Star_2 is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \times 1.002337
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we have:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \times 1.002337
\]

From Wien's Law, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\), so:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}} = \frac{1}{1.002337} \approx 0.997663
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting the values into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (2.25) \times (0.997663)^4
\]

First, compute \((0.997663)^4\). Using the approximation \((1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.002337\):

\[
(0.997663)^4 \approx 1 - 4 \times 0.002337 = 0.99067
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.99067 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \(2.23\) times greater than that of Star_2.
