Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring, but considering relativistic effects. So, it's not the classical harmonic oscillator anymore. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. But with relativity, things get a bit more complicated because as speed increases, the relativistic mass comes into play, right?

Wait, but wait. Relativity can affect the equations of motion for a harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in classical mechanics, F = -kx, but in relativity, the force might be different because the mass isn't constant. Or maybe it's about how the energy is treated. Hmm, I'm not too sure about the exact approach here.

Let me recall. In special relativity, the momentum p is related to velocity v by p = γmv, where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe the equation of motion incorporates relativistic momentum.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law. So the force is F = -kx, same as before, but the equation of motion would involve relativistic mass. So the equation would be F = d(p)/dt, where p is relativistic momentum.

So F = d/dt (γ m v). So F = m d/dt (γ v). Wait, but F is given as -kx. So we have m d/dt (γ v) = -k x.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe it's easier to think about energy. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic plus potential energy. Wait, but in harmonic oscillators, the potential is (1/2)k x². So, the total energy E is conserved. At maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. Then, when the oscillator reaches the equilibrium position (x=0), all that potential energy converts into kinetic energy. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, but wait. In relativity, the total energy E is given by E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)², where p is the momentum. And kinetic energy is E - m c². So, in this case, at x=0 (equilibrium), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. But wait, in the classical case, the energy is (1/2) k A², which equals (1/2) m v_max². So the maximum speed is v = sqrt(k A² / m). But that's in the non-relativistic case. Which is option C, but the question is relativistic, so that's probably not the right answer.

Wait, but when relativity is considered, the mass increases as the velocity increases. So at maximum speed, the mass is γ m. So maybe I should use the relativistic energy equation.

Let me think. The total energy of the oscillator should be conserved. At maximum displacement (x=A), the potential energy is (1/2) k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2) k A² plus the rest mass energy? Wait, not sure. Or maybe the total energy includes the rest mass energy as a separate term.

Wait, in the rest frame of the oscillator, when it's at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. But when it's moving through the equilibrium point, all that potential has been converted into kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy at that point would be (1/2) k A². But wait, the rest mass energy is mc², but that's constant, right?

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy (including rest mass) is (1/2) k A² + mc². Then, at the equilibrium point, the energy is all kinetic plus rest mass energy. So:

E_total = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ) = (1/2) k A² + mc².

Hmm, but wait, in the non-relativistic case, E_total is (1/2) k A², but in reality, the rest mass energy is a huge term, so unless k A² is comparable to mc², the classical approximation holds. But in this problem, since it's relativistic, we can't make that assumption.

So, when the oscillator is at x=0, its velocity is maximum, and the potential energy is zero. So the total energy at x=0 is the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. Wait, no, the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So,

E_total = mc² + K,

where K is the kinetic energy. And this E_total should equal the potential energy at maximum displacement, (1/2)k A², plus the rest mass energy at that point, which is the same?

Wait, no. Wait, when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude (x=A), it's momentarily at rest, so its velocity is zero, so its kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy at that point is the potential energy (1/2 k A²) plus the rest mass energy, which is mc². So E_total = mc² + (1/2) k A².

Then, when it's at x=0, the potential energy is zero, but the kinetic energy is maximum. So E_total is now (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 = (E_total)^2 → p is the momentum, and at x=0, the velocity is maximum, so p = γ m v_max.

Wait, but E_total = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ) = mc² + (1/2) k A².

So, let's write that equation:

sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ) = mc² + (1/2) k A².

Hmm, maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

So,

(pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 = [ mc² + (1/2) k A² ]^2.

Expanding the right side:

(mc²)^2 + 2 mc² (1/2) k A² + ( (1/2)k A² )^2.

So,

(mc²)^2 + mc² k A² + (k² A^4)/4.

Now, subtract (mc²)^2 from both sides:

(pc)^2 = mc² k A² + (k² A^4)/4.

But p = γ m v.

So,

( γ m v c )^2 = mc² k A² + (k² A^4)/4.

Divide both sides by m² c²:

γ² v² = (k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²).

Hmm, perhaps we can factor that.

Alternatively, let's factor out (k A²)/(4 m² c²):

Wait, maybe not. Let me think about rearranging terms.

Rearranging:

γ² v² = [ k A² (4 m c²) + k² A^4 ] / (4 m² c² )

Hmm, perhaps not super useful.

Alternatively, let's think about how γ relates to v. γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, γ² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²).

So, substituting back into the equation:

(1/(1 - v²/c²)) v² = (k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²).

Let me multiply both sides by (1 - v²/c²):

v² = [ (k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²) ] (1 - v²/c²).

Expanding the right-hand side:

v² = [ (k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²) ] - [ (k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²) ] (v²/c²).

Bring the terms involving v² to the left:

v² + [ (k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²) ] (v²/c² ) = [ (k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²) ].

Factor v² on the left:

v² [ 1 + (k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ] = (k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²).

Wait, let me factor the denominator in the coefficients:

The coefficient of v² is:

1 + (k A²)/(m c²) + ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2.

Because (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) = ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2.

So, v² [ 1 + a + a² ] = (k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c² ), where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me see:

Wait, let me compute the right-hand side (RHS):

RHS = (k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²) = [ (2 m c² k A²) + k² A^4 ]/(4 m² c²)

Hmm, but perhaps I can factor this as:

RHS = [ (k A²) ( 2 m c² + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / (4 m² c^4) )? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'll let a = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, RHS becomes:

(k A²)/(m) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²) = (2 m c² a)/(m) + (4 m² c^4 a²)/(4 m² c²) )

Wait, because (k A²) = 2 m c² a, so substituting:

RHS = (2 m c² a)/m + ( (2 m c² a)^2 )/(4 m² c²)

Simplify:

= 2 c² a + (4 m² c^4 a²)/(4 m² c² )

= 2 c² a + (c² a^2 )

So, RHS = c² (2 a + a² )

Similarly, the left-hand side (LHS) is:

v² [ 1 + a + a² ].

So, putting it all together:

v² (1 + a + a² ) = c² (2 a + a² )

So, solving for v²:

v² = [ c² (2a + a²) ] / (1 + a + a² )

Take square root:

v = c sqrt( (2a + a²) / (1 + a + a²) )

Hmm, can this be simplified? Let's factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: a (2 + a )

Denominator: 1 + a + a²

Wait, not sure. Maybe another approach.

Let me look back at a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So, substituting a into v:

v = c * sqrt( [ 2a + a² ] / [1 + a + a² ] )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2a + a² = a (2 + a )

Denominator: 1 + a + a² = (a² + a + 1 )

Hmm, perhaps we can write the fraction as:

(a (2 + a )) / (a² + a + 1 )

But that doesn't seem to simplify much. Alternatively, perhaps factor the denominator. Wait, a² + a + 1 is a quadratic, but discriminant is 1 - 4 = -3
