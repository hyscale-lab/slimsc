Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the actual difference, the lines would overlap, and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties. Wait, but the states themselves have their own uncertainties. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state's energy, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let's think differently. When you have two states, each with a certain uncertainty in energy, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because otherwise, the two energy levels would overlap in the uncertainty range, making them indistinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in E1 plus the uncertainty in E2. Because each state has an uncertainty in its own energy due to their lifetimes. So for E1, the uncertainty ΔE1 is ħ/(2 Δt1). Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 Δt2).

So, the minimal ΔE that allows clear distinction would be when ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Or perhaps, the minimal ΔE is when it's greater than the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. I'm a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

First, compute the energy uncertainty for each state.

For state 1: ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * Δt1)
Δt1 = 1e-9 s
So ΔE1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) ) = approx 5.25e-26 J.

Wait, but I need that in eV. Hmm. Let me convert J to eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So, 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.28e-7 eV.

Wait wait, let me do the calculation properly.

ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 5.272859e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.60217663e-19 J) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2, Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) )= 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert J to eV: 5.272859e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is approximately 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be larger than the sum of these two uncertainties, right? Because if the difference is less than the combined uncertainty, you can't distinguish the two states.

Wait, but wait. Are the uncertainties additive? Or is each state's uncertainty a separate consideration?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE must be larger than each individual uncertainty. Because if ΔE is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then E1's uncertainty is smaller than ΔE, and E2's as well. Or perhaps it's when the sum is considered.

Wait, I think the minimal condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because if the two states' energies are within each other's uncertainty, you can't resolve them.

Wait, for example, suppose E1 is at E and E2 is at E + ΔE. The uncertainty around E is ΔE1, and around E2 is ΔE2. So for E2 to be clearly above E1, the lower end of E2's range (E2 - ΔE2) must be above the upper end of E1's range (E + ΔE1).

So, E2 - ΔE2 > E + ΔE1 → E2 must be greater than E + ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, the required ΔE is E2 - E1 ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, in our case, the minimal ΔE is approximately 3.29e-7 eV + 3.29e-8 eV = 3.619e-7 eV.

Wait, let me calculate that:

3.29e-7 + 0.329e-7 = 3.619e-7 eV.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is 0.001e-6 eV, which is way smaller than our required 3.6e-7 eV.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → that's 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's larger than 3.6e-7, so that would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → which is 0.1e-7 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check my numbers.

Wait, what's 3.29e-7 eV? That's 0.329e-6 eV, or 329e-9 eV. So the required ΔE is about 361.9e-9 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 100e-6 eV, which is way larger than 361e-9 eV. So 1e-4 is 100e-6, which is 100,000e-9, way larger than 361e-9. So that's sufficient, but perhaps there's a closer option.

Wait, but the options don't have anything between 1e-8 and 1e-4. Oh, the options are:

A) 1e-9 → nope.

B) 1e-11 → no.

C) 1e-4 → yes.

D) 1e-8 → which is 10e-9, which is 0.01e-6, which is 10e-9 eV. Which is 1e-8 eV.

Wait, our required ΔE is about 3.6e-7 eV = 360e-9 eV. So option C is 1e-4 eV = 100e-6 eV = 1e-4 eV, which is 100e-6 is 1e-4, which is way bigger than 3.6e-7. So that's clearly sufficient.

But wait, looking at the answer options, the only one that is larger than the required 3.6e-7 is option C (1e-4 eV) and maybe option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8 is 0.0001e-6, so 0.1e-7, which is 1e-8.

Wait, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is much smaller than 3.6e-7. So option D is smaller than required, so it wouldn't work.

So the correct answer must be option C, 1e-4 eV.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, let me redo the calculation of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE = ħ/(2Δt). So let's compute for each state.

For E1, Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9) = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2e-9 s) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = 5.25e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 /1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is ~3.28e-7 eV, ΔE2 is ~3.28e-8 eV.

Sum: 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.608e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be at least 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at options, only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 3.6e-7 eV. So it definitely satisfies the condition.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle is often written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So perhaps I should use that formula. Let me recalculate using that.

So, for E1: Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 ≥ ħ/(2 Δt1) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = 5.25e-26 J → 3.28e-7 eV.

Same as before. So the same conclusion applies.

So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but wait another thought. Are we considering the energy difference between the two states, or the uncertainty in each state's energy?

Because in this case, each state has its own energy uncertainty. So when trying to resolve E1 and E2, their energies must be separated by more than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because otherwise, the uncertainty ranges would overlap.

So, E2 - E1 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So the minimal ΔE is 3.6e-7 eV. So any ΔE higher than that would allow the two states to be distinguished.

Looking at the options again:

C) 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 * 1e6 meV = 100 meV. Hmm, no, wait, 1 eV is 1e6 meV. So 1e-4 eV is 0.1 meV. That's way larger than 3.6e-7 eV, which is 0.36e-6 eV or 0.36 meV.

Wait, 3.6e-7 eV is 0.36e-6 eV. So, 0.36 meV. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.1 meV? Wait no, 1e-4 eV is 0.1 meV? Wait, 1 meV is 1e-3 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 0.1 meV? Wait, no:

Wait, 1 meV = 10^-3 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 0.1 meV. But wait, 3.6e-7 eV is 0.36e-6 eV, which is 0.36 meV. So 1e-4 eV is larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.1 meV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV, which is larger than 3.6e-7 eV.

So option C would allow the two states to be distinguished.

Wait, but 1e-4 is much larger than 3.6e-7. So that works.

But wait, I'm looking at the options again. Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, and that's 1e-4 eV. Which is way bigger than our calculated 3.6e-7 eV. So that would definitely allow the states to be distinguished.

Wait, but what about option D, which is 1e-8 eV? That's 1e-8 eV, which is 0.1e-7 eV, which is 0.1 meV. Our required ΔE is 3.6e-7 eV, which is 3.6e-7 eV, which is 0.36 meV. So option D's 0.1 meV is less than 0.36 meV. So D isn't sufficient. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait another point. Maybe I made a mistake in how I apply the uncertainty principle. Because perhaps when considering two states, the relevant uncertainty is the uncertainty in the measurement, not each individual state's uncertainty. So when you're measuring the energy, the uncertainty in the measurement time would be the time it takes for the state to decay. Or perhaps the time is the time the system is observed, but that's getting a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be greater than the uncertainty in energy for the shorter-lived state. Because the shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty. So ΔE needs to be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties, which is ΔE1.

So in this case, ΔE1 is 3.28e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than that.

So the minimal ΔE is about 3.28e-7 eV. Looking at the options, none of them match exactly, but option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. So that's acceptable.

Wait, but the options don't have anything in the 1e-7 eV range. Option C is 1e-4, which is a thousand times bigger. So that's the only option that works.

So the answer must be option C, 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference required to distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\pi},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (related to the lifetime of the state), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
For \( E_1 \), the lifetime is \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \), the lifetime is \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of the two states:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-9} = 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This value is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-11} = 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). This value is also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-4} = 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \). This is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it satisfies the condition.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-8} = 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 0.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
