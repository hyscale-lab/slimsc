Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the actual difference, the lines would overlap, and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties. Wait, but the states themselves have their own uncertainties. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state's energy, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let's think differently. When you have two states, each with a certain uncertainty in energy, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because otherwise, the two energy levels would overlap in the uncertainty range, making them indistinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in E1 plus the uncertainty in E2. Because each state has an uncertainty in its own energy due to their lifetimes. So for E1, the uncertainty ΔE1 is ħ/(2 Δt1). Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 Δt2).

Wait, but wait. The energy-time uncertainty principle is about the uncertainty in the state's own energy. So each state has its own energy uncertainty based on its lifetime. So when considering two states, E1 and E2, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be resolvable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the uncertainty in the energy of the system, but I'm not quite sure. Let me try to approach this step by step.

The energy-time uncertainty says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/(2π), so the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≥ ħ/(2π Δt). Since Δt here is the lifetime of the state, which is the time for which the state exists before decaying, so for E1, Δt is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt is 1e-8 seconds.

So, let's compute the energy uncertainties for each state.

For E1: ΔE1 = ħ/(2π Δt1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2π * 1e-9 s) )

Similarly, E2: ΔE2 = ħ/(2π Δt2) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2π * 1e-8 s) )

Wait, let me compute these numerically. But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in eV and seconds, since the options are given in eV.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So I can convert the results into eV.

But wait, perhaps there's a shortcut. Let me think about the orders of magnitude.

First, compute ΔE1:

Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

So, ħ/(2π Δt1) = (1e-34) / (2 * 3e8 * 1e-9) )

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

So, ħ/(2π Δt1) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 3.1416 * 1e-9 )

Calculating denominator: 2 * 3.14 ≈ 6.28; 6.28 * 1e-9 = 6.28e-9.

So, numerator is 1.05e-34.

So, 1.05e-34 / 6.28e-9 = approximately 1.67e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, 1.67e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.04e-7 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 1e-7 eV.

Similarly, for Δt2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2π Δt2) = 1.05e-34 / (6.28 * 1e-8 ) = 1.05e-34 / 6.28e-8 = approximately 1.67e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 1.67e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 1.04e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is about 1e-7 eV, ΔE2 is about 1e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, perhaps? Because if the difference is smaller than either, the states might not be resolvable.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each state has its own uncertainty in energy. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is less than the sum, then the two energy levels might overlap in their uncertainty ranges, making them indistinguishable.

So, ΔE (difference) must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

In our case, ΔE1 is ~1e-7 eV, ΔE2 ~1e-8 eV.

So ΔE must be > 1.1e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV.

Wait, that's way bigger than 1e-7. So that would satisfy the condition. Option A is 1e-9 eV, which is way smaller than 1e-7. Option B is 1e-11, which is even smaller. Option D is 1e-8, which is less than 1e-7.

Wait wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me re-calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Compute ΔE1:

Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2π Δt1) = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * π * 1e-9 s) )

Denominator: 2 * π ≈ 6.283. So 6.283e-9.

So 1.05e-34 / 6.283e-9 = approx 1.67e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.67e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 1.04e-7 eV.

Similarly, for Δt2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = (1.05e-34) / (6.283e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 6.283e-8 = approx 1.67e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 1.67e-27 / 1.602e-19 = approx 1.04e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is 1e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 1e-8 eV.

So the sum is 1.1e-7 eV.

Thus, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than this sum, which is approximately 1e-7 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 1e-7.

Option A: 1e-9 eV.

Option B: 1e-11 eV.

Option D: 1e-8 eV.

So, only option C is larger than 1e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be at least around 1e-7 eV to be resolvable.

Wait, but wait: the options don't have 1e-7. The closest is option C, which is 1e-4, which is 1e3 times bigger than 1e-7. So that would definitely work.

But let me check if I might have made a mistake in calculation. Because 1e-4 seems a bit large, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, let's think again about the energy-time uncertainty. The formula is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ / (2π), so the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So longer lifetimes mean smaller energy uncertainty. 

E1 has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) than E2 (1e-8 s), so E1 has a larger energy uncertainty. So the dominant uncertainty is from E1, which is 1e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that.

So, the energy difference must be > 1e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 times larger. So it's sufficient.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of either state. Because if the difference is larger than both individual uncertainties, then they can be resolved.

Wait, but the combined uncertainty would be the sum. But perhaps the correct approach is to have the energy difference greater than each individual uncertainty, but given that the energy difference is between E1 and E2, perhaps the correct approach is to have ΔE > max(ΔE1, ΔE2). Because if the energy difference is larger than the larger of the two individual uncertainties, then they can be resolved. 

Wait, because if ΔE is larger than both, then E2 is definitely above E1's uncertainty, and E1 is below E2's uncertainty. So they don't overlap.

Wait, let's see. Let's say E1 has energy E1, with uncertainty ΔE1, and E2 has energy E2, with uncertainty ΔE2. So the actual energies of E1 and E2 lie within intervals [E1 - ΔE1/2, E1 + ΔE1/2] and [E2 - ΔE2/2, E2 + ΔE2/2], respectively.

For these two intervals to not overlap, the lower end of E2's interval should be above the upper end of E1's interval. So E2 - ΔE2/2 > E1 + ΔE1/2.

Which simplifies to E2 - E1 > (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2.

So the required energy difference is greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2.

In our case, (1e-7 + 1e-8) eV ≈ 1.1e-7 eV. So (1.1e-7)/2 = 5.5e-8 eV.

So the energy difference has to be larger than about 5.5e-8 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 5.5e-8; so that's good.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8. So 1e-8 is just a little under 5.5e-8. So that's not enough.

Wait, wait, 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, which is smaller than the required 5.5e-8 ≈ 0.55e-7.

So, the correct energy difference must be larger than approximately 5.5e-8 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4) is in that ballpark. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait, the options given are:

A) 1e-9 eV

B) 1e-11 eV

C) 1e-4 eV

D) 1e-8 eV

So option C is way larger than 5.5e-8, so it's acceptable. The other options are too small.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\pi},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (which is the lifetime of the state), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using the formula for energy uncertainty:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2\pi \Delta t},
\]

we calculate:

1. For \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2\pi \cdot 10^{-9}} \approx 1.67 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.67 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2\pi \cdot 10^{-8}} \approx 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.67 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 1.04 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 1.04 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
The energy difference must be greater than \( 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Let us compare this with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-9} = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-11} = 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than \( 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-4} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-8} = 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
