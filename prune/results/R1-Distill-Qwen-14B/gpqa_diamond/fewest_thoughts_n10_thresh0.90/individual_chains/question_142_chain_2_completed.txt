Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact details. Let me think this through.

The question provides a specific density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

I need to find its geometrical position in qubits space from the given options. The options are A to D, each giving a different coordinate r.

Wait, the geometrical position... I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Right! For a single qubit, the state can be represented on a Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices have a different representation than pure states. Pure states are vectors on the Bloch sphere, while mixed states are points inside a sphere or perhaps in some other way.

Density matrices have certain properties: they must be positive semi-definite, Hermitian, and have a trace of 1. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So, let's break down the given ρ. It's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is the outer product, which in matrix form is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (1/2) * I. That makes sense because (1/2)(I) is a valid density matrix for a completely mixed state. 

In the Bloch sphere representation, the state is written as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. For ρ = I/2, that must mean that all the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z are zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but the options are given as r=(1,1,0), etc. Let me look at the options. Option C is (0,0,0), which would correspond to the completely mixed state. That makes sense because the given ρ is a maximally mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

So the answer should be option C, r=(0,0,0). Let me just check the options again. Yes, option C is (0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin, meaning it's the completely mixed state.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described using the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\), and the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z}{2},
\]

where \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), all coefficients \(r_x\), \(r_y\), and \(r_z\) must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the completely mixed state located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided:
- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this represents a different state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this matches the given density matrix for a maximally mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
