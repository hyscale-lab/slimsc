Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. So I need to find its geometrical position in the qubit space, and the options are given as vectors in some space—probably the Bloch sphere or something similar.

Wait, right, qubits are typically represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize the state of a qubit, where each point on the sphere's surface corresponds to a pure state. The density matrix description extends this to mixed states, which can be anywhere inside the sphere.

The density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (rx, ry, rz), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So, I need to express the given ρ in that form and find the corresponding r vector.

Looking at the given ρ: it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. I remember that |0⟩⟨0| is the outer product, which would be a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 at (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1's on both the diagonal. So, |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is:

1 0
0 1

But then we multiply by 1/2, so the diagonal becomes 1/2 each. So ρ is:

[ [0.5, 0],
  [0, 0.5] ]

Wait, but that's the identity matrix scaled by 0.5. Because I know that the identity matrix is [[1,0],[0,1]], so 0.5 times that is exactly what we have here.

Now, the general form of the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2. Let me expand that. The Pauli matrices σ are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So r·σ would be rx σx + ry σy + rz σz. Let's plug that into the general form.

(I + rx σx + ry σy + rz σz ) / 2.

Expanding this, we get:

[ [ (1 + rz)/2, (rx - i ry)/2 ],
  [ (rx + i ry)/2, (1 - rz)/2 ] ]

Wait, let me check that. Let's compute each element.

The (1,1) element is (1 + rz)/2 + 0 (since σx, σy contribute off-diagonal terms).

The (1,2) element is (rx - i ry)/2 because σx has 1 in off-diagonal, σy has -i in the (1,2) position, so when you add rx σx (which has rx at (1,2)) and ry σy (which has -i ry at (1,2)), you get rx + (-i ry) multiplied by 1/2.

Similarly, the (2,1) element is rx + i ry all over 2.

The (2,2) element is (1 - rz)/2.

Now, the given ρ is diagonal with 0.5 on the diagonal and zero elsewhere. So when I compare the two expressions, the off-diagonal terms in ρ must be zero. Let's set the off-diagonal elements equal.

From our given ρ, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are zero. So:

(rx - i ry)/2 = 0
(rx + i ry)/2 = 0

These imply that rx - i ry = 0 and rx + i ry = 0. Let me solve these equations.

From the first equation: rx = i ry
From the second equation: rx = -i ry

Substituting the first into the second: i ry = -i ry
Which implies 2 i ry = 0 => ry = 0, and then rx = 0.

So rx and ry must be zero.

Now, looking at the diagonal elements. The (1,1) element of ρ is 0.5, and according to the general form, it's (1 + rz)/2. So:

(1 + rz)/2 = 0.5
Multiply both sides by 2: 1 + rz = 1
Subtract 1: rz = 0.

So, the components rx=0, ry=0, rz=0. Therefore, the Bloch vector is r = (0,0,0).

Wait a second, but the Bloch vector represents the state as a point on the unit sphere. If r is zero, then the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So ρ is the completely mixed state, which makes sense because it's a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because when the Bloch vector is at the origin, it's the maximally mixed state, which is indeed (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which should be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with 0.5 on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere:

\[
\rho = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0 \\
0 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we express the density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) using the general form:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the off-diagonal elements of \( \rho \) are given by:

\[
\frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{r_x + i r_y}{2}.
\]

Since the given \( \rho \) has zero off-diagonal elements, we find:

\[
r_x - i r_y = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad r_x + i r_y = 0.
\]

Solving these, we conclude \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). Next, the diagonal elements of \( \rho \) are given by:

\[
\frac{1 + r_z}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1 - r_z}{2}.
\]

For the given \( \rho \), the diagonal elements are 0.5. Setting \( \frac{1 + r_z}{2} = 0.5 \), we find \( r_z = 0 \). Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

From the options:

- **A)** \( (1,1,0) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B)** \( (0,0,1) \): Incorrect, as \( r_z \) is 0, not 1.
- **C)** \( (0,0,0) \): Correct, as this matches the Bloch vector derived above.
- **D)** \( (1,1,1) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( \mathbf{r} = (0,0,0) \).

Answer: C
