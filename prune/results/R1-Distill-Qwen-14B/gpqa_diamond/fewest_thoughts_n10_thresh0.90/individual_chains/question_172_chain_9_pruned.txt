Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? And the question is about iron atoms in the photosphere of two stars. Oh wait, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. 

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, and it says both photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I'm thinking, in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy states follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

So the number of particles in a particular energy state is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, let me write that down. For two states E1 and E2 where E1 > E2, the ratio n1/n2 = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ). Since in this case, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms in a specific energy level as star_2. So if I take the ratio (n1_star1 / n2_star1) and (n1_star2 / n2_star2), but wait, no. Wait, the problem says that for star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is different for the two stars.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: Let’s denote for star_1, the number of excited atoms is n1, and for star_2 it's n2. According to the problem, n1 = 2 * n2. Wait, no, actually, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps it's the ratio of the excited state population to the total or something else. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think again. The question is about the excitation of iron atoms in their energy levels. So the excitation level depends on temperature. The higher the temperature, the more atoms are in higher energy levels. So star_1 has higher excitation, meaning higher temperature than star_2.

The ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let's say the energy difference is ΔE = E_high - E_low. The ratio n_high / n_low = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). 

In star_1, the ratio is (n_high)_1 / (n_low)_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ). Similarly, in star_2, it's (n_high)_2 / (n_low)_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ). 

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the ratio n_high_1 / n_high_2 is 2, or maybe n_high_1 / (n_low_1) = 2*(n_high_2 / n_low_2). Hmm, that's getting confusing. Alternatively, it could be that the excitation level is such that the fraction of atoms in the higher energy state is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, (n_high1 / n_low1) = 2 * (n_high2 / n_low2). 

But I'm not sure. Let me think. The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. That would probably mean that the number of atoms in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Assuming that the lower state is the same for both, or perhaps that the ratio is considered relative to another level.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation
