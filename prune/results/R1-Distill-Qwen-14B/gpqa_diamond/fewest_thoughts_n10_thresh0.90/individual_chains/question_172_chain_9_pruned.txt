Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when we talk about the photosphere of a star, that's the layer where light is emitted, right? And LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which means that in small regions of the photosphere, the conditions can be approximated as if they're in equilibrium, so we can use the Boltzmann distribution to describe the energy levels of atoms.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level is higher for star_1. I'm trying to remember how excitation levels relate to temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation tells us that the population of a particular energy level is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, let's get that straight. If the excitation is higher (more atoms in the excited state), that would imply a higher temperature because higher temperatures make it easier for atoms to reach higher energy levels. Because the exponential term would be larger if T is larger.

So for star_1, the ratio of excited to ground state (or whichever lower state it's compared to) is twice that of star_2. Let's denote the ratio as n1 for star_1 and n2 for star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So n = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to the number in a lower state is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. But if the question is about the excitation level, and assuming the same transition, maybe the statistical weights are the same, so the ratio simplifies to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But in this case, the excitation is compared between two stars. So for each star, the ratio would be exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for star_1, the ratio is R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, but the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, so R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Because the excitation being higher would mean more atoms in the higher energy level. So the ratio R is (number in excited) / (number in lower). So if star_1 has more excited atoms (twice as much), then R1 = 2 R2.

So substituting: exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, that can't be right. Because if T1 is higher, then exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) would be smaller than exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), since higher T makes the exponent less negative.

Hmm, maybe I got the ratio inverted. Let me think again. Suppose
