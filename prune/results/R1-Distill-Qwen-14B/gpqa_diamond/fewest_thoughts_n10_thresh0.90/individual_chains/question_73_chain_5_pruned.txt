Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to use Einstein's theory of relativity. Right, so for velocities, I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula, not just simple addition.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. So I think I should calculate the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference. Oh right, because relative velocity requires knowing how each views the other's speed.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is v = (u - v') / (1 - (u v')/(c²)), where u is the speed of one object in the initial frame, and v' is the speed of the other object in that same frame. Wait, no, actually, let me get that right. Suppose I have two objects moving at u and v in the same direction relative to some frame. The speed of one as seen from the other's frame would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, astronaut A has mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B has mass 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. Let me assume that I want to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame. So for A, the speed of the other is (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by 1 minus (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's perspective, the speed of B would be (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/c²). Let me plug in the numbers. The numerator is (-0.1c). Denominator is 1 - (0
