--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin. Then, I'm supposed to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 when i is not j, and zero otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Wait, the operator's matrix is A_ij = hbar/2 for i≠j and 0 otherwise. So for a two-level system, which it must be because the state is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, the matrix would look like this:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Because the diagonal elements are zero (since when i=j, A_ij is zero), and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, the matrix is 2x2, because it's spin-1/2. So for a two-level system, the operator's matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Right, that makes sense. So this operator is actually proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply that by hbar/2, you get the given matrix.

So the operator in question is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the X operator, like the |+> and |-> states of the x-spin.

Now, the problem is asking for the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So that's the probability that the system is found in the |+> state and the |-> state when measuring sigma_x (or the corresponding eigenstates of operator A).

Wait, but wait. The state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A (which are the eigenstates of sigma_x), and then the probabilities will be the squares of the coefficients in that expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize the operator A and find its eigenstates, then express |alpha> in that basis.

Alternatively, since operator A is proportional to sigma_x, its eigenstates are the same as those of sigma_x. So maybe it's easier to find the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of sigma_x.

Wait, but maybe I should first normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional to something. So first, let's find the normalization constant.

The state is |alpha> = C [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], where C is a normalization constant. To find C, the sum of the squares of the moduli of the coefficients must be 1.

So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Their moduli are sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2), and sqrt(2² + (-1)²) = sqrt(5), respectively.

So |C|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 ] = 1.

Compute |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7.

Thus, |C|^2 *7 =1 → |C|=1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ].

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring the operator A (which is proportional to sigma_x), I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's. Let me recall that the eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |−x>, which can be written as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. The eigenstates of sigma_x are such that sigma_x |+x> = +|+x>, and sigma_x |−x> = -|−x> .

Wait, the standard eigenstates for sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but wait, wait: that can't be right because if you apply sigma_x to |+x>, you should get |+x> multiplied by 1.

Wait, sigma_x is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply it to |+x>, which is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), you get (|down> + |up>)/sqrt(2) ) = |+x>, so eigenvalue is 1. So yes, that's correct.

So, to find the probability of measuring |+x> and |−x>, I need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, because |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, I can compute the inner products < +x | alpha> and < -x | alpha>, then the probabilities are the squares of those.

So let's compute < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

First, |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

Expressed in components:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) |up> + (2 - i) |down> ]

The inner product < +x | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So let's compute this:

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Since <up|up> = 1, <down|down> =1, and <up|down> = <down|up> =0.

So it simplifies to:

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 1 ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Simplify the numerator:

(1 + 2) + (i -i) → 3 + 0i → 3.

So < +x | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, (1+i)+(2-i) = (1+2)+(i -i)=3 +0=3.

So yes, the inner product is 3/sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 → approximately 0.642857.

Similarly, the inner product for < -x | alpha >:

|−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Compute < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Again, cross terms are zero. So:

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)(1) - (2 -i)(1) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1 + i) - 2 + i ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (-1) + 2i ]

Hmmm, the numerator is (-1 + 2i). So the magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So |< -x | alpha > |^2 = 5/(14) ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but let me compute this again. Let's compute (1+i) - (2-i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i. So [ (-1) + 2i ].

The modulus squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) =1+4=5. So |< -x | alpha > |^2 =5/(14) ≈0.357.

Wait, but wait, when I compute < -x | alpha >, the inner product is (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] → that's (1 +i - 2 +i) = (-1 + 2i).

The modulus is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(5), so the inner product is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14), which has a modulus squared of (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

Wait a second, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.35714. So the probabilities are ~64.2857% and ~35.7143% respectively.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which would be 64% and 36%. That's close to what I have here—9/14 is about 0.642857 (so 0.64), and 5/14 is about 0.35714 (so 0.36). So that would match option A for the probabilities. But wait, I should check all parts of the problem because the question also asks for the average value of the operator.

Wait, let's look at the options again. Option A's average is hbar/7. Hmm. Let's see.

The operator A has eigenvalues ± (hbar/2), because it's (hbar/2) times sigma_x, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2)(+1) = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)(-1) = -hbar/2.

The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha> .

Alternatively, since we can express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value.

So, |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, with coefficients c_+ and c_-, where |c_+|^2 is 9/14 and |c_-|^2 is 5/14.

So, |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x> .

The expectation value <A> is c_+^* c_+ (hbar/2) + c_-^* c_- ( - hbar/2 ) ?

Wait, no. Wait, because when you express |alpha> as a sum of eigenstates of A, each term contributes its eigenvalue multiplied by the probability.

So <A> = |c_+|^2 (hbar/2) + |c_-|^2 (- hbar/2).

Wait, that's correct. Because the eigenvalue for |+x> is hbar/2, and for |−x> it's -hbar/2.

So plugging in the numbers:

|c_+|^2 =9/14 → contribution (9/14)*(hbar/2)
|c_-|^2 =5/14 → contribution (5/14)*(-hbar/2)

So <A> = [9/14 * (hbar/2)] - [5/14 * (hbar/2) ]

= (9 -5)/(14) * (hbar/2)
= (4)/(14) * (hbar/2)
= (2/7) * (hbar/2)
= hbar/7.

Hmm, that's matching option A's average value of hbar/7.

Wait, but let me compute it in another way. Alternatively, perhaps using the matrix form of A and the state vector.

The state |alpha> is in the z-basis, so the vector is [1+i, 2 -i ] scaled by 1/sqrt(7).

So the density matrix is |alpha><alpha|.

The expectation value <A> is Tr( A rho ), where rho is the density matrix.

So compute each element:

rho = |alpha><alpha| /7.

The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So compute the trace of A rho.

The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of A rho.

But since A is [[0, a],[a,0]] where a= hbar/2,

and rho is (1/7) * [ (1+i)(2-i)* , (1+i)(2-i)*, (2-i)(1+i)*, (2-i)(1+i)* ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

Since |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]

So <alpha| is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ]

A is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

So A |alpha> is:

(hbar/2) * [ (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ] ]

So <alpha| A |alpha> is:

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down| ] * (hbar/2) (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ]

Multiply these together:

= (hbar/(2*7)) [ (1-i)(1+i) <up|down> + (1-i)(2 -i) <up|up> + (2+i)(1+i) <down|down> + (2+i)(2 -i) <down|up> ]

But <up|down> and <down|up> are zero.

So the terms reduce to:

= (hbar/(14)) [ (1-i)(1+i) * 0 + (1-i)(2 -i)*1 + (2+i)(1+i)*0 + (2+i)(2 -i)*1 ]

Compute each non-zero term:

(1-i)(2 -i ) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 →2 -3i -1 (since i^2=-1) → (2-1) -3i →1 -3i.

(2+i)(2 -i) = 4 -2i +2i -i^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the expression becomes:

= (hbar/(14)) [ (1 -3i) +5 ]

= (hbar/(14)) [6 -3i ]

Wait, but that gives a complex number, which can't be right because the expectation value for an observable should be real. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the terms. Let me re-express <alpha| A |alpha>:

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that A is proportional to sigma_x, and the expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha> can be found via <sigma_x> = [ (1+i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1-i) ] / (something), but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, another approach. The expectation value of A is Tr( A rho ), where rho is |alpha><alpha| /7.

The trace is (A_11 rho_11 + A_12 rho_12) + (A_21 rho_21 + A_22 rho_22 )).

But since A is [[0, a],[a,0]], where a = hbar/2, and rho is:

rho_11 = |1+i|^2 /7 =2/7,

rho_12 = (1+i)(2-i)/7,

rho_21 = (2 -i)(1 -i)/7,

rho_22 = |2 -i|^2 /7 =5/7.

So, Tr( A rho ) = A_11 rho_11 + A_12 rho_12 + A_21 rho_21 + A_22 rho_22.

A_11 is 0, A_22 is 0.

So Tr = (0 * 2/7) + (a * rho_12 ) + (a * rho_21 ) + (0 * 5/7 )

= a ( rho_12 + rho_21 )

But rho_12 + rho_21 = [ (1+i)(2-i) + (2-i)(1 -i) ] /7.

Compute (1+i)(2-i) = (2 -i + 2i -i² ) = 2 +i +1 (since i²=-1) → 3 + i.

And (2 -i)(1-i) = 2*(1) + 2*(-i) -i*(1) +i^2 → 2 -2i -i -1 → (2-1) + (-3i) →1 -3i.

So adding them: (3 +i) + (1 -3i) =4 -2i.

Thus, rho_12 + rho_21 = (4 -2i)/7.

So Tr = a * (4 -2i)/7.

But a is hbar/2.

So Tr = (hbar/2)(4-2i)/7.

Wait, but this gives a complex number again, which can't be correct. So I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the rho_12 and rho_21 terms.

Wait, rho_12 is (1+i)(2-i)/7. Let's compute that.

(1+i)(2-i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (i)(2) + (i)(-i) = 2 -i +2i -i².

Simplify: 2 +i - (-1) → 2 +i +1 =3 +i.

Similarly, rho_21 is (2 -i)(1 -i)/7.

(2 -i)(1 -i) = 2*(1) + 2*(-i) -i*(1) +i^2 → 2 -2i -i -1 → (2-1) + (-3i) →1 -3i.

So rho_12 = (3 +i)/7, rho_21 = (1 -3i)/7.

So rho_12 + rho_21 = [3 +i + 1 -3i]/7 = (4 -2i)/7.

So Tr = (hbar/2) * (4-2i)/7.

Wait, that's (hbar/2) * (4 -2i)/(7) = (hbar (4-2i) )/(14) )= (hbar (2 -i) )/(7).

But this is a complex number, which can't be right because the expectation value of an observable must be real. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication earlier. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that I didn't normalize the state correctly.

Wait, earlier, I calculated the normalization as 1/sqrt(7), but let me double-check.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

The norm squared is |1+i|² + |2-i|² = (2) + (5) =7. So normalization is 1/sqrt(7). That's correct.

So perhaps there's a mistake in the way I expanded the expectation value. Let me try again.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

A is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

So <A> = (hbar/2) <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> .

But sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when acting on |alpha>, it swaps |up> and |down> with a phase of +1.

Wait, no, sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>.

So, sigma_x |alpha> = (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up>.

Then, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is the inner product between <alpha| and sigma_x |alpha> .

Which is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] . (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ]

So the product is (1/7) [ (1 -i)(1+i) <up|down> + (1 -i)(2 -i) <up|up> + (2 +i)(1+i) <down|down> + (2 +i)(2 -i) <down|up> ]

Again, the cross terms are zero.

So simplifying:

= (1/7) [ (1 -i)(1+i)*0 + (1 -i)(2 -i) *1 + (2+i)(1+i)*0 + (2+i)(2 -i) *1 ]

Compute each non-zero term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² → 2 -3i -1 → (2-1) -3i → 1 -3i.

Wait, no: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) → 2 -i -2i + (i²) → 2 -3i -1 → (2-1) =1; so 1 -3i.

Wait, but wait: i² is -1, so 2 -i -2i + (-1) → 2-3i -1 → 1 -3i.

And (2 +i)(2 -i) =4 -2i +2i -i² →4 - (-1) →5.

So the total is (1 -3i) +5 =6 -3i.

Thus, <sigma_x> = (6 -3i)/7 → <A> = (hbar/2) * (6 -3i)/7.

Wait, but this is giving a complex result, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate <sigma_x>:

Wait, when I compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>:

It's (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ]

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(7)) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i)(1+i) <up|down> + (1-i)(2 -i) <up|up> + (2+i)(1+i) <down|down> + (2+i)(2 -i) <down|up> ]

Which simplifies to:

(1/7) [ 0 + (1-i)(2 -i) *1 + (2+i)(1+i)*1 + 0 ]

So the terms are:

(1-i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i*i → 2 -i -2i + (-1) → (2-1) -3i →1-3i.

Similarly, (2+i)(1+i) =2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i → 2 +2i +i -1 → (2-1) +3i →1 +3i.

So the sum is (1-3i) + (1+3i) = (1+1) + (-3i +3i )=2 +0i=2.

Wait, wait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Oh! I see, earlier I had (2+i)(2 -i) which is 5, but actually, in this context, it's (2+i)(1+i) =1+3i. So the correct sum is (1-3i) + (1+3i)=2.

So <sigma_x> =2/7.

Thus, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/(7).

Which matches option A's average value of hbar/7.

Wait, but earlier, when I calculated using the eigenstate decomposition, I got the same result: <A> = hbar/7.

So the expectation value is hbar/7, which is real as expected.

Now, the probabilities were 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14 ≈0.357.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and expectation hbar/7.

So that's the correct option.

Wait, but wait a second. When I computed the coefficients for |+x> and |−x>, I found 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The moduli squared are (3^2)/14=9/14 and ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )/14=5/14.

Which sum to14/14=1, correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.35714.

Which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A.

So the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Operator Matrix and Eigenstates**:
   - The operator \( A \) is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, with \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_x \) are \( \pm 1 \), so the eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).
   - The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) (and hence \( A \)) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \).

2. **State Normalization**:
   - The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize, calculate the modulus squared of the coefficients:
     \[
     |1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5, \quad \text{so the normalization factor is } \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
     \]
   - The normalized state is:
     \[
     |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
     \]

3. **Probabilities in Eigenstates of \( A \)**:
   - To find the probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these states:
     \[
     |\alpha\rangle = c_{+x} |+x\rangle + c_{-x} |-x\rangle,
     \]
     where:
     \[
     c_{+x} = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle, \quad c_{-x} = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle.
     \]
   - Compute the inner products:
     \[
     \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
     \]
     \[
     \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
     \]
   - The probabilities are the squared moduli:
     \[
     P(+x) = |c_{+x}|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad P(-x) = |c_{-x}|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
     \]
   - These probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

4. **Average Value of \( A \)**:
   - The expectation value of \( A \) is:
     \[
     \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
     \]
   - Using the eigenstate decomposition, the expectation value is:
     \[
     \langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
     \]
   - Substituting the probabilities:
     \[
     \langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively. The average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

**Answer: A**
