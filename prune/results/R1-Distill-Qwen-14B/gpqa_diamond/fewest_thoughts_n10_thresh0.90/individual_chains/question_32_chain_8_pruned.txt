Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons and varying neutrons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we need to use the theory of relativity, particularly the energy-momentum relation. The energy of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where p is the momentum and m is the rest mass. But wait, I also need to find the kinetic energy, or is the question just asking for the total energy? Let me think. The options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So I think the problem is asking for the total energy, including rest mass energy.

Wait, no. Wait, no—wait, actually, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy each particle has. Because the rest mass is much smaller, but for heavy ions, maybe it's a significant part. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

In colliders, the total energy (which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy) is what's important for the collisions. But sometimes, people refer to the kinetic energy as the energy imparted by the collider. Hmm. I think in this case, the question is about the total energy because the problem states "the energy of the RHIC," which is the machine's energy. So I should calculate the total energy, E = gamma * m c².

But wait, the problem is about the speed being 0.96c. So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that first.

So v is 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So 1/gamma is sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, let's calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, let me calculate it with more precise numbers. Because 0.28 is exact here, right? Because 0.28^2 is exactly 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Now, I need to find the total energy E = gamma * m c². But what's the rest mass of the nucleus X (Li-6)?

The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is approximately... I should look this up, but since I can't, I need to remember that the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for a nucleus with A=6, the mass is approximately 6 * 938 MeV/c², but that's the rest mass.

Wait, but the actual mass might be a bit less than 6 * 938 because of binding energy. But for heavy ions in colliders, the mass is often approximated as A * (proton mass) because the binding energy is much smaller compared to the rest mass. So perhaps I should use m = A * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass.

Wait, but lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So the average would be roughly 938.5 MeV each. So for 6 nucleons, total rest mass is about 6 * 938.
