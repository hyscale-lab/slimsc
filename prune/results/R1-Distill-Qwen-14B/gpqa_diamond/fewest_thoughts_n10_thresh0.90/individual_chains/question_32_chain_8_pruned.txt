Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So, let me think about that.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Lithium usually has 3 protons because the atomic number is 3. But if it has 3 neutrons, that means it's Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. That's helpful because I'll need the mass to calculate the energy.

The problem is about relativistic speeds, so I remember that the energy of a particle in relativity is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh right, that formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

The speed here is 0.96c. So I can plug that into the gamma equation. Let me calculate that. Let me compute (v/c)² first, which is (0.96)^2. 0.96 times 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then take the square root of that. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think. Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that division. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98, so 3.5714 would be 1/0.28, yeah that's right because 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1.

So gamma is about 3.5714. But wait, I should probably compute that more accurately. Let me compute 1 divided by 0.28 exactly. 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/(28/100)=100/28=25/7≈3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.57143. Now, the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is m*c². So I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, Li-6 has 6 nucleons, right? So the mass is 6 times the mass of a proton. Because protons and neutrons are almost the same mass, and in this case, the nucleus is Li-6, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton.

The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So 6 times that is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. So the rest mass energy is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait a minute, are you sure about that? Because the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV, but for a nucleus, you also have to consider binding energy. But I think in these high-energy physics problems, they often approximate the mass as the sum of the individual nucleons without considering binding energy. So for the purpose of this problem, I'll proceed with the mass as 6 * 938 MeV/c².

So the rest energy is 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

So now, the total energy is gamma * m c². So 3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. Let me calculate 3.5714 *5.628.

Hmm, 3 *5.628 is 16.884. 0.5714 *5.628: Let's compute 0.5 *5.628 =2.814, 0.0714 *5.628 ≈0.0714*5=0.357, 0.0714*0.628≈0.0449, so total about 0.357+0.0449=0.4019. So 2.814 +0.4019=3.2159.

So total is 16.884 +3.2159=20.0999 GeV, approximately 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute this more accurately. Let's compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

3.57142857 *5.628:

Let me write it as 3 + 0.57142857.

3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628: Let me compute 0.57142857 *5 =2.85714285.

0.57142857 *0.628 = let's compute that.

Wait, 0.57142857 multiplied by 0.6 is 0.34285714, and 0.57142857 multiplied by 0.028 is approximately 0.016 (0.57142857 *0.02 =0.01142857, 0.57142857 *0.008=0.00457143, so together about 0.0159999).

So 0.34285714 +0.0159999 ≈0.358857.

So 0.57142857 *5.628 =2.85714285 +0.358857 ≈3.2159998.

Adding to the 16.884 gives 16.884 +3.216 ≈20.100 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, another thing: the mass of the Li nucleus. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So the total mass is 3*938.272 + 3*939.565.

Let me compute that:

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total = 2814.816 +2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Ah, I see, I used 5.628 GeV before, but more accurately it's about 5.6335 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.6335 GeV. So gamma is about 3.57143.

So 3.57143 *5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57143 *5.6335.

Let me compute 3 *5.6335 =16.9005.

0.57143 *5.6335:

Compute 0.5 *5.6335 =2.81675.

0.07143 *5.6335.

Compute 0.07 *5.6335 =0.394345.

0.00143 *5.6335 ≈0.008060.

So 0.394345 + 0.008060 =0.402405.

So 0.07143 *5.6335 ≈0.402405.

So the 0.57143 *5.6335 is 2.81675 +0.402405=3.219155.

Adding to the 16.9005 gives 16.9005 +3.219155 =20.119655 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419

Our calculation is about 20.1197 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). But why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recalculate gamma more precisely.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(
