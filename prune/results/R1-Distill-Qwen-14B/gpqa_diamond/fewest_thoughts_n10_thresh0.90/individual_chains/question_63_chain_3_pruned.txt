Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, let me think. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh right, when a photon is absorbed, its energy plus the initial energy of the molecule leads to the final energy. But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So the next state would probably involve the next higher energy level.

I need to figure out the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state. But what's the fundamental state exactly? Oh, right, the ground state is the lowest energy, and the first excited state is the next. But wait, for a diatomic molecule modeled by the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by the combination of rotational and vibrational energy.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and ground rotational state, which is the fundamental state. So the next possible state would be either the next rotational level or the next vibrational level. But which one has a lower energy difference?

I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized as E = (v + 1/2)ħω + (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). Which one requires less energy? Well, the vibrational energy levels have a spacing of ħω, which is usually higher than the rotational energy spacing because rotational energy per level is proportional to J², and J starts from 0.

Wait, but what's the value here? Let me think about the energy differences. The vibrational energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is (3/2)ħω, because the energy for vibrational is (v + 1/2)ħω. So from v=0 to v=1, it's an increase of ħω. For rotational, from J=0 to J=1, the energy increases by (2 + 1) * (something). Wait, no, more carefully:

The rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So for J=0 to J=1, delta E = (2 * ħ²)/(2I) - 0 = (ħ²)/(I). So I need to calculate which is smaller: ħω or ħ²/(I), because the photon's energy must match the difference between the initial and final state.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state and the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one with the smallest possible energy increase. So the photon's energy should be the minimum possible to cause a transition. So between the vibrational and rotational transitions, I need to see which requires less energy.

So I should compute both and see which is smaller.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference. That's just hν = ħω * 2π? Wait no, the energy for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_v = (1)ħω. Because E_v = (v + 1/2)ħω. So the difference is (1 + 0.5 - 0.5)ħω = ħω. So the photon's energy must be ħω.

Next, compute the rotational energy difference. From J=0 to J=1. So ΔE_r = [ (1)(2) * ħ² / (2I) ] - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I). So I need to compute I. The moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

The reduced mass μ is (m_x m_y)/(m_x + m_y). Masses are given in amu, so need to convert to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg.

So Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator. Numerator is (20 * 1.66e-27) * (2 * 1.66e-27) = 20*2 * (1.66e-27)^2. Denominator is 20 + 2 =22 amu, converted to kg: 22 * 1.66e-27 kg.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the reduced mass in terms of amu. Since μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) )= (20 *2)/(22) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

So μ ≈ 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg. Wait, let's compute that: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 = approx (1.8 * 1.66)= about 2.988e-27 kg.

Now, r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = (approx 3e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ΔE_r = ħ²/(I). Let's plug in the numbers. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_r = 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ approx 9e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

First, compute I:

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2 amu) ) = (40) /22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 1.818 *1.66e-27 ≈ 2.999e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = (2.999e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². So I= 2.999e-27 *4e-20 = 1.1996e-46 kg m².

So I ≈ 1.2e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ² is (1.0545718e-34 J s)^2 = approx (1.05e-34)^2 = 1.10e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_r = (ħ² ) / I = (1.1e-68 J s²) / (1.2e-46 kg m²). Wait, units? J is kg m²/s². So let me check the units:

ħ² has units (J s)^2 → (kg² m^4/s²). I is kg m². So ħ² / I → (kg² m^4/s²) / (kg m²) ) → kg m²/s² → which is J. So units are correct.

So compute the value:

1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 = (1.1 /1.2
