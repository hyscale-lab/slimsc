Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. M1 = 1.5 M2.
- The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because λ is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The question says they are the same in terms of the observed wavelengths. So both stars have the same effective temperature?

Yes, I think so. So T1 = T2.

The radial velocities are given: Star_1 is 0 km/s, Star_2 is 700 km/s. But I'm not sure how that affects luminosity. Radial velocity is about how fast the star is moving towards or away from us. But since Star_1 is not moving relative to us, and Star_2 is moving, maybe this affects their observed brightness? Or wait, maybe it's about the Doppler effect on the star's spectral lines, but the question says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, but we've already considered that in the temperature, so maybe the radial velocity doesn't affect the peak wavelength. Or perhaps the radial velocity is a redshift or blueshift factor, but since the peak wavelengths are same, maybe it's accounted for in the temperature being same. So perhaps the radial velocities come into play elsewhere, but for the purpose of calculating luminosity, maybe they don't matter because luminosity is an intrinsic property. Hmm, perhaps I can ignore the radial velocities for the luminosity calculation. Or maybe the radial velocity affects the observed brightness, but luminosity is the intrinsic brightness.

Wait, the problem says astronomers computed the luminosity, assuming black bodies. So luminosity would be intrinsic, not the observed flux. So perhaps radial velocity doesn't matter for luminosity. So I'll set that aside for now.

The question asks: the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of which option?

Luminosity for a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since they're black bodies, this should apply.

We can write L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

Similarly, L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

But since T1 = T2, as established earlier, T1⁴ = T2⁴. So the ratio L1/L2 is (R1²)/(R2²). Since R1=1.5 R2, then (R1/R2) is 1.5, so squared is (2.25). So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is approximately 2.25.

Wait, but wait. The options are A) ~2.25, D) ~2.23. Hmm, but wait, let's check.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the stars are radiating as black bodies, so we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law. But perhaps there's another factor I'm missing. Oh, oh! Because the stars are moving, their observed flux might be affected by the Doppler effect, but the question is about computed luminosity, which is intrinsic. So when computing luminosity, the radial velocity may not affect it because luminosity is intrinsic. So the Doppler effect affects observed flux or apparent brightness, but not the actual luminosity.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest were the same. So that would imply that the observed wavelengths (which could be affected by Doppler) are the same. So perhaps the star with radial velocity 700 km/s has its light shifted, but the effective temperature calculation must account for that.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wien's Law says the peak wavelength is λ_max = b / T, where T is the effective temperature. But if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted. So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, would its observed λ_max be longer (redshifted) than its actual λ_max?

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max is same, but
