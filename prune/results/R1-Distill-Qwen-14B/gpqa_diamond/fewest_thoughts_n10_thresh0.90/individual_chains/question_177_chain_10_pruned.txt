Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii and masses are both 1.5 times larger for Star_1 compared to Star_2. Interesting. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength for their black body radiation, right? Remember, that's governed by Wien's Law.

Wait, Wien's Law says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T, where T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because T = constant / lambda_max. So T1 equals T2. Oh, that makes sense.

So, the stars have the same temperature. Now, the question is about their luminosities. Luminosity of a star depends on radius and temperature, right? The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T, the luminosity will scale with R squared.

Wait, so if Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, then its luminosity should be (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times that of Star_2. But wait, the options don't have exactly 2.25 as the answer. Let me look at the options.

Options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. Oh, A is 2.25. So why isn't the answer A?

Hmm, wait. Did I miss something else? Because the problem also talks about radial velocities. The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh, right, that's the Doppler shift. How does that affect the observed wavelength?

But wait, the peak wavelengths are the same as measured. So, the measured peak wavelengths are the same. But if one star is moving towards or away from us, that would cause a Doppler shift, changing the observed wavelength. So, if Star_2 has a velocity, but their measured peak is the same, then there's a Doppler effect that must be considered when comparing their actual temperatures.

Wait, so the peak wavelengths observed are the same. So, the observed lambda is the same for both. But the actual emitted lambda depends on the star's temperature. So, if one star is moving, its actual emitted wavelength is different from the observed. So, let's think about this.

Wien's Law: lambda_emitted = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. The observed lambda would be lambda_observed = (lambda_emitted) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ) approximately, assuming v_r is much less than c. But wait, if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shifted) and if moving away, it's longer (red shifted).

Wait, Star_1 has v_r =0, so observed lambda is same as emitted. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. Let's compute the Doppler shift for Star_2.

But wait, in the problem statement, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed lambda_max for both is the same. Let me denote lambda_obs = lambda_1_emitted (since Star1 has v_r=0) and lambda_obs = (lambda_2_emitted) * Doppler factor.

So, lambda_1 = lambda_2 * (Doppler factor for Star_2)

And because lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature, so T1 = (lambda_2 / lambda_1) * T2.

Wait, let me think again. The observed lambda is the same for both. So for Star_1, lambda_obs = lambda_1_emitted (because v_r is 0). For Star_2, lambda_obs = lambda_2_emitted * Doppler factor.

So, lambda_1_emitted = lambda_obs = lambda_2_emitted * Doppler factor.

So, the temperatures are T1 = b / lambda_1_emitted, T2 = b / lambda_2_emitted.

So, T1 = (lambda_2_emitted / lambda_1_emitted) * T2.

But since lambda_1_emitted = lambda_obs and lambda_2_emitted = lambda_obs / Doppler factor.

So, lambda_2_emitted = lambda_obs / (1 + v_r / c), approximately, since v_r is positive when moving away, leading to a longer observed wavelength (redshift). Wait, but the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Since the problem doesn't specify direction, but in the calculation, the Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) )

But when v_r is positive (moving away), the observed wavelength is longer. So, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed emissions are redshifted. But in our case, the observed lambda for both is the same. So, Star_2's emitted wavelength must be shorter than Star_1's emitted wavelength, since it's moving away, making the observed longer. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away (v_r positive), its emitted light is redshifted. So, the observed lambda_obs is longer than emitted. But in this case, the observed lambda is same as Star_1's emitted. So, if Star_2's emitted lambda is shorter (because it's moving away, so observed is longer)—so, Star_2's actual emitted peak wavelength is shorter than Star_1's, which would imply a higher temperature for Star_2.

Wait, no. If Star_2 is moving away, then the observed lambda is longer than the emitted. But the problem says that the observed lambda is same for both. So, Star_1's emitted is lambda_obs (v=0), and Star_2's emitted is lambda_obs / Doppler factor (since it's moving away, so Doppler factor makes the observed longer). So, lambda_2_emitted = lambda_obs / (Doppler factor). Since the Doppler factor is greater than 1 for moving away, lambda_2_emitted is less than lambda_obs, meaning T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, no. Because T is inversely proportional to lambda. So, if lambda_2_emitted is less than lambda_1
