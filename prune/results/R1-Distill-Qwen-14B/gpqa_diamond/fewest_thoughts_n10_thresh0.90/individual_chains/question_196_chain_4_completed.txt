Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options are given as A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I can't use the classical formula directly.

Relativistically, things get more complicated because as speeds approach the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant. The kinetic energy in relativity isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. The total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), kinetic energy is maximum, and potential is zero. But wait, in the relativistic case, does the potential energy also change? Or is it still (1/2)kx²?

I think the potential energy is still (1/2)kx² because the force is given by F = -kx, so the potential is the integral of F, which would be (1/2)kx². So, the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA², same as in the classical case.

At the equilibrium point (x=0), the oscillator's velocity is maximum, so all the energy is kinetic. But wait, is that correct? Because in the classical case, yes, but relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (gamma -1)mc². Hmm.

Wait, the total energy E is (gamma) mc². So when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So E = gamma mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, that's not right. Because when x is A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and when x is 0, kinetic energy is maximum. So E = (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy at x=0 plus the rest energy? Wait, no. Wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy includes rest mass energy. So perhaps E is the sum of rest mass energy plus kinetic energy?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is different. Let me try to model this correctly.

In the classical case, the total energy E is (1/2)kA², and this equals the kinetic energy at x=0, which is (1/2)mv_max². So v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), but that's the classical non-relativistic case.

In the relativistic scenario, the maximum kinetic energy plus rest energy equals the total mechanical energy. So E = (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

Wait, that's because at maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential. So (1/2)kA² is the total mechanical energy, which includes the rest energy mc² plus any kinetic energy. But wait, when x is A, kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)kA² = mc². But that can't be right because then the relativistic effects would make the speed zero? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is not (gamma -1) mc². Alternatively, maybe the energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where p is the momentum.

But the harmonic oscillator's energy is quantized, but this is a classical problem, so we can ignore quantization. So the total energy of the oscillator is E, which is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement, x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and E = (1/2)kA².

But wait, in the relativistic scenario, does the potential energy include any relativistic corrections? The problem says it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx, so potential is (1/2)kx². So E = (1/2)kA².

At the point of maximum speed (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So E = (1/2)kA² = kinetic energy. But relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So setting (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so solving for v.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's call this equation (1).

Wait, but let's think: If the oscillator is subject to relativistic effects, then when it reaches maximum speed, the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) mc² = (1/2)kA². So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a small parameter, but probably not necessary for the answer.

So, from gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), rearrange:

gamma -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) - 1. Wait, no, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 + B, where B is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But perhaps rather than expanding, I can solve for v.

gamma = 1 + B,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²),

so,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + B.

Invert both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + B).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + B)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + B)^2).

Hmm, but let me compute 1 - 1/(1+B)^2.

Wait, 1/(1+B)^2 = [1/(1 + B)]^2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 1 - 1/(1+B)^2 as [ (1+B)^2 -1 ] / (1+B)^2.

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(1+B)^2 -1 = 1 + 2B + B² -1 = 2B + B².

So,

v²/c² = (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2B + B²) ) / (1 + B) ) ).

But for small B, perhaps this can be approximated, but in any case, let's substitute B = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2*(k A^2/(2 m c²)) + (k A^2/(2 m c²))² ) ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)) )

Simplify numerator inside the square root:

2*(k A^2/(2 m c²)) = (k A^2)/(m c²).

So,

2B = (k A^2)/(m c²), and B² = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

(2B + B²) = (k A^2/(m c²)) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A^2/(m c²)) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / ( (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 )

This is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps I can factor out (k A^2/(m c^2)) in the numerator.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when k A^2 is much smaller than 2 m c², but the problem doesn't state that. So perhaps the correct approach is to leave it as is.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c²)) )

Wait, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me go back. The total energy E is (1/2)kA^2. At x=0, all this energy is kinetic.

In relativity, the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) mc^2.

So,

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, alpha.

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c^2) = 1 + alpha.

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 )

= c sqrt( [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

= c sqrt( (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1) ) / (1 + alpha)

= c sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha )

Factor out alpha:

= c sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c²), which is a small term if k A is not too large compared to m c². But regardless, let's plug back alpha.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ] ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Simplify numerator inside the square root:

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) = (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

= (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A²) )/(2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, maybe this is getting too messy. Alternatively, I can expand the numerator and denominator:

Let me write alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

= c * [ sqrt(alpha (2 + alpha)) ] / (1 + alpha )

But this doesn't seem to match any of the given options. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: v_max= c*sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c²)))

Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Option D: c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2mc^2)))^2 )

Wait, from earlier steps, I have v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ), where alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + alpha)]^2 )

Which can be written as c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 )

Which is option D, since option D is c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 mc²)))^2 )

Wait, looking at option D:

D) v_max= c√(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2mc²)))^2)

Yes, that's exactly what I have here.

Wait, but then option B is v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²))) )

Which would be a different expression.

So, from my calculation, the correct expression is option D.

Wait, but wait, in the denominator, option D has (1 + (kA²/(2 mc²)) ) squared.

Yes, because from v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ), alpha = (k A²)/(2 mc²), so 1 + alpha is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc²).

So, that matches option D.

But another thought: when kA²/(2 mc²) is small, the expression approximates to the classical result.

Let's see. If (kA²)/(2 m c²) << 1, then 1/(1 + alpha) ≈ 1 - alpha, so 1/(1+alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 alpha.

So,

1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ≈ 1 - [1 - 2 alpha] = 2 alpha.

So,

v ≈ c * sqrt(2 alpha) = c * sqrt( 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) )

= c * sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) )

= c * (A sqrt(k/m) ) / (c sqrt(m)) )

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-do.

Wait, sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c²) ) = (A sqrt(k/m)) / c.

So,

v ≈ c * (A sqrt(k/m) ) / c ) = A sqrt(k/m) )

Which is the classical result. So that makes sense when the term is small.

So, in the limit of low speeds (alpha << 1), option D gives the correct classical result.

Looking back at the options, option C is the classical result. So when alpha is small, option D reduces to option C, which is correct. So that makes sense.

So, I think the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Relativistic Energy Considerations**:  
   The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the total energy is:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy is given by \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Setting these equal:  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we invert and square to solve for \( v \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal and squaring:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

4. **Verification in the Classical Limit**:  
   When \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \ll 1 \), the relativistic expression reduces to the classical result \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), which corresponds to Option C. This confirms the correctness of Option D in the relativistic case.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
