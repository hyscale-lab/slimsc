Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, coupling isn't the issue because the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, matching the expected molecule. Hmm.

Alright, so let's break it down. The NMR has two peaks for the same proton. Since the integrals add up to 1H, it's not a splitting due to coupling. Oh, wait, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin, so it can't be something like a doublet of doublets. So other possibilities are at play here.

What else causes duplicate peaks? Maybe something to do with the structure. If the compound is a racemic mixture, that would give enantiomers. But in NMR, for a chiral center, each enantiomer would present the same NMR spectrum because the protons are equivalent in each. Unless maybe the compound is not chiral, but wait, if it's a diastereomer, then the NMR would show different shifts for each set. Or perhaps it's a result of some other structural issue.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two equal peaks with the same mass. Same mass, same retention time? No, because the question says two peaks, so maybe different retention times but same mass. Oh, wait, no, same mass because same molecule. So perhaps it's a mixture of two molecules that have the same mass but different structures? No, but the question says both have the same mass spectrum as expected. So they're the same compound.

Wait, but the NMR is showing two peaks for the same proton. So, perhaps the compound is a diastereomer? Like, maybe a mixture of diastereomers. Because diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would be different. So each diastereomer would have a different environment for the alpha-proton, leading to two separate peaks.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two peaks have similar shifts. That might mean that the diastereomers are not too different, perhaps only in a part that doesn't affect the alpha-proton's environment much. Or maybe the alpha-proton is in a similar environment in both cases, but other protons are different.

Alternatively, could it be that the compound is a racemic mixture of enantiomers? But for enantiomers, the NMR spectrum would look the same because they're mirror images. Unless the machine is unable to detect the difference, but if the question says that the NMR shows two peaks, that's probably not the case. So option B is probably not right because enantiomers wouldn't split the peaks.

Another thought: the question says the 1H NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. In an enantiomer, each would have the same shift, so that wouldn't cause two peaks. Diastereomers would have different shifts because their structures are not mirror images. So maybe if there are two diastereomers, each
