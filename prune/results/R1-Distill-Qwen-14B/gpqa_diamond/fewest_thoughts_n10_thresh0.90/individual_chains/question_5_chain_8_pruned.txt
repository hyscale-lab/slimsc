Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector for a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, I remember from my notes that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So, the operator here is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, that's like the Pauli X matrix.

Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Oh right, the Pauli Y matrix.

And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix.

Wait, but the operator here is along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz) because it's in the x-z plane. So the operator vector P is the sum of the components times the direction unit vector. So the operator we need is P = nx Px + nz Pz. Because Py isn't involved since the direction is in x-z plane.

So, the operator P is nx*(ħ/2) * X + nz*(ħ/2) * Z.

But I need to find the eigenvector of this operator for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the equation is (P - (ħ/2)I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. So, (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0. So I can write the matrix form of P and then set up the equation.

Let me compute P. Let's factor out ħ/2. P = (ħ/2) (nx X + nz Z). So nx and nz are the components of the unit vector in x-z plane. So nx^2 + nz^2 = 1.

So, the matrices:

X is [[0 1],[1 0]]
Z is [[1 0],[0 -1]]

So nx X is [[0, nx],[nx, 0]]
nz Z is [[nz, 0],[0, -nz]]

Adding them, P becomes:

(ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

So, the matrix P is (ħ/2) times [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let me write the eigenvalue equation.

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So, substituting the matrix:

(ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the matrix equation becomes:

nz a + nx b = a

nx a - nz b = b

Let me subtract 'a' and 'b' from both sides to form equations.

First equation: nz a + nx b - a = 0 → a (nz - 1) + nx b = 0

Second equation: nx a - nz b - b = 0 → nx a - b (nz + 1) = 0

So, now I have two equations:

1) a (nz - 1) + nx b = 0

2) nx a - b (nz + 1) = 0

I can try to solve these equations for a and b.

Let me express equation 1:

a (nz - 1) = - nx b → a = [ -nx b ] / (nz - 1 )

But maybe it's better to express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Wait, from equation 2: nx a = b (nz + 1) → a = [ (nz + 1) / nx ] * b 

But wait, I can substitute this into equation 1.

Substituting a from equation 2 into equation 1:

[ (nz +1 )/ nx ] * b * (nz - 1) + nx b = 0

Factor out b:

b [ (nz +1)(nz -1)/nx + nx ] = 0

Since the eigenvector is non-zero, b can't be zero. So the term in brackets must be zero.

So,

(nz^2 -1)/nx + nx = 0 → [ (nz^2 -1) + nx^2 ] / nx = 0

Multiply both sides by nx:

nz^2 -1 + nx^2 = 0 → nz^2 + nx^2 = 1

Which is true because nx^2 + nz^2 = 1 (since n is a unit vector). So, the equation is satisfied.

Hmm, so let's go back. From equation 2, a = [ (nz +1 ) / nx ] * b 

So, the eigenvector can be written in terms of b. Let's set b = 1 (for simplicity, since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple), then a = (nz +1)/nx.

Wait, but what if nx is zero? Then n would be along z. Hmm, but in that case, the problem is solved differently. Let me think.

Wait, in the general case, nx is not zero because n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. So, I can proceed under the assumption that nx isn't zero.

So, the components are a = (nz +1)/nx, b=1. So the vector is [ (nz+1)/nx, 1 ].

But wait, the eigenvector must be normalized. So let's compute the normalization condition.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Since the components are in a 2-dimensional space, the sum of the squares of the absolute values must equal 1.

So, [ (nz +1)^2 / nx^2 ] + 1 = 1 → [ (nz +1)^2 ] / nx^2 = 0 → Hmm, that can't be right because (nz +1)^2 is only zero if nz = -1, but then that's along z when nx=0. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, that's not the case. Because when I set b=1, the normalization condition becomes |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Wait, substituting a as (nz+1)/nx and b=1:

[ (nz +1)^2 / nx^2 ] + 1 = 1 → (nz +1)^2 / nx^2 = 0 → (nz +1)=0 → nz = -1.

But that would imply that n is along the negative z-axis, which is a specific case. So perhaps this approach is only valid for that case. I think I must have made a mistake in assuming b=1. Because when I set b=1, the normalization condition only holds when nz = -1, which is a special case.

Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me express the eigenvector in terms of a parameter. Let me let b be a variable, then a is expressed in terms of b.

From equation 2: a = ( (nz +1) / nx ) * b 

So, the vector is [a, b] = [ (nz+1)/(nx) b, b ] = b [ (nz+1)/nx, 1 ]

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 → |b|^2 [ ( (nz+1)^2 )/(nx^2) + 1 ] = 1

So, |b|^2 = 1 / [ ( (nz+1)^2 )/(nx^2) + 1 ] 

Let me compute the denominator:

Denominator = ( (nz +1)^2 + nx^2 ) / nx^2 

So, |b|^2 = nx^2 / [ (nz +1)^2 + nx^2 ]

Since nx^2 + nz^2 =1, substitute that:

Denominator = (nz^2 + 2 nz +1 + nx^2 )

But nz^2 + nx^2 =1 → denominator = (1 + 2nz + 1 ) = 2 (1 + nz )

So, |b|^2 = nx^2 / ( 2 (1 + nz) )

But wait, hang on: denominator is (nz +1)^2 + (nx)^2.

Wait, (nz +1)^2 = nz^2 + 2 nz +1, and adding nx^2 gives (nz^2 + nx^2) + 2 nz +1 = 1 + 2 nz +1 = 2(1 + nz). So yes.

So, |b|^2 = nx^2 / [ 2 (1 + nz) ]

Hmmm. Let me factor out 2(1 + nz) as the denominator.

Wait, but what's 1 + nz? Since n is a unit vector, nz can be between -1 and 1.

So, the normalized vector components are:

a = (nz +1)/(nx) * b 

But b is sqrt(nx^2/(2(1 + nz))) ), but wait, because |b|^2 = nx^2/(2(1 +nz)).

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the vector as:

[a, b] = [ (nz+1)/(nx) * b, b ]

We can factor out b:

= b [ (nz+1)/nx, 1 ]

But since |b|^2 = 1/[ ( (nz+1)^2 )/(nx^2) + 1 ], as earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a different approach.

Wait, since the operator is along the direction n, the eigenvectors are the eigenstates of the spin along n. For spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvectors can be written in terms
