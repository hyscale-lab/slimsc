Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because acid-base reactions can get a little tricky. But let me take it step by step. The problem says I have three solutions mixed together, and I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. Let me break down what each part does.

First, the solutions are:
- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the first thing I should do is figure out the total moles of H+ ions from the acids and the total moles of OH- ions from the bases. Then, I'll see which one is in excess. The leftover H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

Let me calculate the moles for each solution.

Starting with the acetic acid: CH3COOH. Its concentration is 0.1 M, and volume is 0.5 L (500 mL). Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. But wait, since acetic acid is a weak acid, it doesn't completely dissociate. But for now, I think I can consider it as a source of H+ in the solution. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, when dealing with neutralization reactions, maybe I should first consider the strong acid and strong base reactions.

Then, the HCl. It's a strong acid, so it'll fully dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. So moles of HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is 1:1 with H+, that's 0.08 moles H+.

Next, Ba(OH)2. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH^-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. That means moles of OH^- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix acids and bases, the H+ and OH- will react: H+ + OH- → H2O. So I should calculate the total H+ from the acids and the total OH- from the base.

Total H+ from acids is from HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it only partially dissociates. But in the presence of a strong acid, maybe the weak acid doesn't contribute much? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, when
