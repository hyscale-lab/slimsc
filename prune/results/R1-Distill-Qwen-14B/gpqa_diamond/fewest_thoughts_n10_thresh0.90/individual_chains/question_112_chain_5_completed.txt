Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Alright, let me read it again.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, so |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So, that's our initial state. But wait, it says proportional, so I think I need to normalize it first. Because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes, so normalization is crucial.

First, I need to find the normalization factor. The state is given as (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. Let me compute the inner product of this state with itself. The inner product is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2−i)*(2+i), because the states |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Wait, no, let me think again. The inner product is |a|^2 + |b|^2 where a and b are the coefficients. So, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2−i).

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i)=1 +1 =2.

Then |2-i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, the matrix is 2x2 because it's for spin up and down. So the matrix A looks like:

[ 0   hbar/2
  hbar/2  0 ]

So this is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal is zero and off-diagonal is hbar/2. Hmm, I think this operator might be related to the spin in the x or y direction, but perhaps it's better to treat it as a separate operator.

The eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the given matrix. Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Because the operator is given, and we need to express the state |alpha> in terms of its eigenstates.

So, the matrix A is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

Wait, no, wait: the determinant is (0 - λ)^2 - ( (ħ/2) )^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → λ = ± ħ/2.

Wait, no, because the determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - ( (ħ/2)^2 ), which is λ² - (ħ/2)^2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2)I) x = 0:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [x]   [0]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ] [y]   [0]

Which gives the equations:

- (ħ/2) x + (ħ/2) y = 0 → -x + y =0 → y = x.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]. Let me normalize it: 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down>).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

(A + (ħ/2) I) x =0:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [x]   [0]
[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [y]   [0]

Which gives (ħ/2)x + (ħ/2)y =0 → x + y =0 → y = -x.

So eigenvector is [1, -1], normalized to 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates of operator A are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for λ=ħ/2, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for λ=-ħ/2.

Now, the given state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). I need to express this state in terms of the eigenstates of A. That is, find the coefficients when |alpha> is written as a linear combination of these two eigenstates.

Let me denote the two eigenstates as |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, |alpha> can be written as c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

To find c_+ and c_-, we can take the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

First, let's compute c_+:

c_+ = < + | alpha >.

So,

< + | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Multiply the terms:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator:

= [ (1+i + 2 - i) ] / sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7) 

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute each part. The inner product when expanding:

= [ (1/sqrt(2))(1)(1+i) + (1/sqrt(2))(1)(2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, no, because <up|up> =1, <down|down>=1, and cross terms are zero.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

|alpha> is (a|up> + b|down> ) / sqrt(7), where a=1+i, b=2-i.

So,

< + | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) (a|up> + b|down>) ] / sqrt(7)

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ a * <up|up> + a <up|down> + b <down|up> + b <down| down> ] / sqrt(7)

But since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, the cross terms are zero.

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ a + b ] / sqrt(7)

a is (1+i), b is (2-i) → a + b = (1+2) + (i -i) = 3.

So,

c_+ = [3 ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) ) = 3 / sqrt(14 )

Similarly, compute c_-:

c_- = < - | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ]*(a|up> + b|down> ) / sqrt(7)

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ a - b ] / sqrt(7 )

a is (1+i), b is (2−i). So a - b = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So,

c_- = ( -1 + 2i ) / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

So, c_+ is 3/sqrt(14), c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait, I need to compute the probabilities. The probability of measuring the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is |c_+|^2, and the probability for -ħ/2 is |c_-|^2.

So let's compute |c_+|^2:

|c_+|^2 = (3)^2 / (14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |c_-|^2 = | (-1 + 2i) |^2 / 14.

Compute | -1 + 2i |^2 → (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.35714. Hmm, but let's check the sum: 9 +5 =14 → sum to 1, which is correct.

Wait, but wait, the options given are for probabilities. Let me look at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36... So 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36, but 0.357 is closer to 0.36. So perhaps that's option A.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. 9/14 is 0.642857... So 0.64 is 0.64, 0.642857 would round to 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which would round to 0.36. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the first part of option A matches.

Now, the average value of the operator. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is the operator with eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and |alpha> is a state expressed as a combination of the eigenstates, the expectation value is c_+*(ħ/2) + c_-*(-ħ/2). Wait, but more accurately, it's |c_+|^2 * (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-ħ/2).

Wait, because the expectation value is the sum of probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. So:

< A > = |c_+|^2 * (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-ħ/2).

We have |c_+|^2 =9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So:

< A > = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)

= [ (9 -5) /14 ] * (ħ/2 )

= (4/14)(ħ/2) )= (2/7)(ħ/2) )= ħ/7.

Wait, that would be option A, which says average is ħ/7.

But let's double-check. Another approach is to compute <alpha| A |alpha> directly.

But since |alpha> is (a|up> +b|down>)/sqrt(7) with a=1+i, b=2−i.

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ a* <up| A |up> + a* <up| A |down> + b* <down| A |up> + b* <down| A |down> ].

But A|up> is (ħ/2)|down>, because the first column of matrix A is [0, ħ/2] → A|up> = (0, ħ/2), which is ħ/2 |down>.

Similarly, A|down> = (ħ/2)|up>.

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ a* (0) + a* (ħ/2) + b* (ħ/2) + b* (0) ]

= (1/7)( ħ/2 (a* + b* ) )

Compute a* and b*:

a = 1 +i → a* =1 -i

b =2 -i → b* =2 +i

a* +b* = (1 +2) + (-i +i )= 3 +0i =3.

So,

= (1/7) * (ħ/2 *3 ) = (3 ħ )/(14 ) ≈ 0.214 ħ.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave <A> as ħ/7 = approx 0.1428 ħ. Wait that's a discrepancy. So which is correct?

Wait, my first approach using the eigenvalues and probabilities gives ħ/7, but the direct calculation gives 3ħ/14. Hmm, that's a problem. So which approach is correct?

Wait, in the first approach, I think I made a mistake. Because the expectation value is the sum of |c_+|^2 times the eigenvalue plus |c_-|^2 times the eigenvalue. So if c_+ is 3/sqrt(14) and c_- is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14), then the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 respectively. So the expectation value should be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) )= ( (9-5)/14 ) * (ħ/2 )= (4/14)(ħ/2 )= (2/7)(ħ/2 )= ħ/7.

But the direct calculation gave (3 ħ )/(14 ), which is 3/(14) ħ ≈ 0.214 ħ, which is the same as (3/14) ħ.

Wait, but that's different. So I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, in the direct calculation, I think I messed up the matrix representation. Let me re-express everything.

The state |alpha> is (a|up> +b|down>)/sqrt(7), with a=1+i, b=2−i.

The operator A has matrix elements A_ij = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ].

So, the expectation value is (1/7) [a* (A_{11} a + A_{12} b) + b* (A_{21} a + A_{22} b) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it as:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ a* (A_{11} a + A_{12} b) + b* (A_{21} a + A_{22} b) ) ]

But A is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 on off-diagonal. So:

A_{11} =0, A_{12}= ħ/2.

A_{21}=ħ/2, A_{22}=0.

So,

= (1/7) [ a* (0 * a + (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) a + 0 * b ) ) ]

= (1/7) [ a* (ħ/2 b ) + b* (ħ/2 a ) ]

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/(2*7)) [ a* b + b* a ]

Compute a* b + b* a:

a =1 +i, so a* =1 -i.

b =2 -i, so b* =2 +i.

a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) = (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1= 1-3i.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i + i².

i² is -1, so 2 +3i -1= 1 +3i.

So a* b + b* a = (1-3i) + (1+3i) )= 2.

So, <A> = ( ħ/(2*7) ) * 2 = ( ħ/(14) ) * 2 = ħ/7.

Ah, so the mistake was in the initial direct calculation. I must have miscalculated earlier. So the correct expectation value is ħ/7, which matches the first method.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 (about 0.64) and 5/14 ≈0.357 (about 0.36). The average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that matches.

Wait, but let me confirm all steps again. Because sometimes when I'm under time pressure, I might have missed a step.

Wait, the eigenstates for A are |+> and |->. The state |alpha> is expressed as a combination of these. The probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Yes, and the expectation value is the sum of probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. So 9/14 * (ħ/2) +5/14 * (-ħ/2) = (9 -5)/14 * (ħ/2) )=4/14 * ħ/2 = 2/7 * ħ/2 = ħ/7.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option A, which has probabilities approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and an average of ħ/7.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to compute the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be calculated.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The state is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]
The total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \). The normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates and eigenvalues of \( A \)
The matrix representation of \( A \) is:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues are found by solving \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
To find the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \), compute the inner products:
\[
c_+ = \langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) are:
\[
P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{(9-5)\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The probabilities \( P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) \approx 0.64 \) and \( P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) \approx 0.36 \), and the average value \( \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7} \), match **Option A**.

Answer: A
