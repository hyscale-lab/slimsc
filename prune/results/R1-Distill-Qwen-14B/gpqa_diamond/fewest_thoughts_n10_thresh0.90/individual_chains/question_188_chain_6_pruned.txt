Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and all three angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees.

Wait, wait. I remember that in crystals, interplanar distances are calculated using the structure factor formula. Oh right, the formula involves the reciprocal of the Miller indices and the angles between the lattice vectors. Let me think, the formula is something like d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) involving the cosines of the angles. Or maybe it's a bit more complicated because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice isn't cubic, so the formula changes.

So, rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal, a = b = c, and the angles are all equal too, but not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms. So for a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance 'a' would be the same as the edge length. But in a rhombohedral structure, the relationships are a bit different.

Hmm, I recall that in a rhombohedral (or cubic) system, the interplanar spacing for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) )

Wait, but wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Because in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees here. So the formula simplifies because all the cosines are the same.

Wait, I think the formula for interplanar distance d in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos gamma) + 2(kl cos gamma) )

Because all angles are gamma, so cos(alpha)=cos(beta)=cos(gamma)=cos(30°). So the denominator becomes sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosγ + 2hl cosγ + 2kl cosγ )

So for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

Let me plug in the numbers. First, compute each part.

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 +1 =3.

2hk cosγ = 2*(1)(1)*cos(30°) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3) ≈1.732.

Similarly, 2hl cosγ is same as 2hk cosγ, so another 1.732. Same for 2kl cosγ, another 1.732.

So adding all the terms: 3 + 1.732 +1.732 +1.732.

Wait, 3 + (3 * 1.732) = 3 + 5.196=8.196.

So the denominator is sqrt(8.196). Let me compute that. sqrt(8.196) is approximately, since 2.86 squared is about 8.18, because 2.86^2 is 8.1796. So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863.

Wait, but wait, wait. What is 'a' here? Because the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. In a simple cubic structure, a would be the interatomic distance. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, which are all equal to 'a' in this case.

Wait, but if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and the unit cell is rhombohedral with a = 10 Angstrom? Or is 'a' something else?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think. The interatomic distance 'd' is the distance between adjacent atoms. In a simple cubic structure, this is the same as the lattice parameter 'a'. But in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the lattice points, so the distance between nearest neighbors (interatomic distance) is the same as 'a'. Because the lattice is a, a, a, and the angles are 30 degrees. Wait, no, wait. That might not be correct.

Wait, in a cubic structure, the distance between nearest neighbors is a, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance depends on the angles. Because in a rhombohedral system, the edges are a, but the interatomic distance might not be the same as a. Does that make sense?

Wait, no, perhaps in a simple rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corner of the unit cell, so the edge length is the same as the interatomic distance. But maybe in some other structures, like if there's a basis, the interatomic distance could be different. But the question says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom", so I think in this case, a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, but maybe that's not correct. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the distance between two adjacent lattice points (i.e., the interatomic distance) is determined by the lattice vectors. Let me think in terms of vectors.

The lattice vectors are a, b, c. The nearest neighbor distance would be the magnitude of the vectors when you move along one axis. So, for example, the distance between (000) and (100) is a, (000) and (010) is b, etc. But since a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, the interatomic distance would be 10 Angstrom. So, yes, a is 10 Angstrom.

So then, d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos γ) + 2(kl cos γ) )

So, as before, for (111), denominator is sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.492 Angstrom. Wait, that can't be right because the options given are around 9-10 Angstrom. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Did I get the formula wrong? Because 3.49 is way smaller than the options. So I must have messed up the formula.

Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is reciprocal. Maybe it's 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/a² + ... ?

Wait, no, the formula I remember is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) + (2 hk cos γ)/(a²) + (2 hl cos γ)/(a²) + (2 kl cos γ)/(a^2 )

Wait no, that can't be because then when you have a=10, the 1/d^2 would be small, making d large. But I'm getting confused now.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system.

Another thought: The general formula for interplanar spacing is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \gamma } }

But wait, no, maybe not. In a cubic system, it's d= a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in a rhombohedral, because of the angles, the formula becomes:

d = \frac{ a }{ \sqrt{ h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \gamma } }

Wait, wait, no. Because in a cubic system, the angle is 90°, so cos 90 is 0, which reduces the formula to a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²). So that's correct.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angles are the same as gamma, so cos gamma is same for all terms. So for (111), the denominator is sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*cos30°).

Wait that would be 3 + 2*(3)*cos30°, which is 3 +6*(√3/2) = 3 +3√3. Let me compute that numerically.

3√3 is approximately 5.196. So 3 +5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863. So d= a / 2.863.

Wait, but if a is 10 Angstrom, then d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. But the options are all around 9-10. So I'm way off. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternative thought: perhaps the interatomic distance is not the same as 'a'. Maybe 'a' is the lattice parameter, and the interatomic distance is different, perhaps related via the angles.

Wait, another approach: in a cubic system, the interatomic distance is 'a'. But in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance 'd' isn't 'a'; it's a function of the angles.

Wait, no. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the unit cell is a cube, and each corner has an atom. The nearest neighbors are along the cube edges, so the distance is 'a'. So in that case, a is the interatomic distance.

But in a rhombohedral structure, the same applies. The unit cell is a rhombohedron with a, a, a edges and angles alpha, beta, gamma. So the nearest neighbor distance is 'a', because each corner atom is at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), etc.

Wait, but maybe the interatomic distance is 'a', so in this problem, a=10 Angstrom. So then the earlier calculation of d=3.49 Angstrom would be correct, but that's not matching any options. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually referring to a
