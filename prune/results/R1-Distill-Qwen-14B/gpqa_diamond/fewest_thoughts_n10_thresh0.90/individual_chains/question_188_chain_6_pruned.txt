Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that we have a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral structure is a type of crystal system where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, right? But in a crystal, the structure is built of unit cells, so maybe that's the lattice parameter a?

Wait, no. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c might not all be the same, but in the case of a primitive rhombohedral system, I think all edges are equal, making it a special case. So I think in this question, the a, b, c are all the same, say 'a', which is 10 Angstroms. Because if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, that's probably the lattice parameter a in a simple cubic structure, but rhombohedral is a bit more complex.

So the question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The interplanar distance, d, is given by the formula d = a / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk cos alpha) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos gamma) ), but wait, no, that's more for orthorhombic systems. Wait, I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, no, for any crystal system, the general formula for the interplanar spacing is 1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - 2 (hk)/(a b cos gamma) - 2 (hl)/(a c cos beta) - 2 (kl)/(b c cos alpha), but that's when the Miller indices are hkl. But wait, that's probably more complicated because for a general case, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are equal. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, another approach. For a rhombohedral crystal, the
