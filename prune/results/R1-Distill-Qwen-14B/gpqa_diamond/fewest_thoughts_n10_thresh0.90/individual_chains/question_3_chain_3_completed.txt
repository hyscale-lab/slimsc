Alright, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem step by step. Okay, so the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a given spin-half particle in a specific state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the state vector and the operator in question.

The particle is in a superposition state given by 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I think |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the sigma_z operator. So sigma_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for these states, right?

The operator we're interested in is 10σ_z +5σ_x. Oh wait, the expectation value of an operator is the sum of the expectation values of each term because expectation values are linear. So, I can compute the expectation for 10σ_z and 5σ_x separately and then add them.

First, let's compute the expectation of σ_z. Since the state is a linear combination, the expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is just the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So for |↑⟩, the coefficient is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. For |↓⟩, the coefficient is sqrt(3)/2, so its square is (3/4)=0.75. The eigenvalues for σ_z are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, but the operator is 10σ_z, so ⟨10σ_z⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5. Wait, no wait. Wait, no, the operator is 10σ_z, so the expectation would be 10 * ⟨σ_z⟩. Right, because expectation is linear. So 10 times -0.5 is -5.

Now, moving on to σ_x. I think σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which is a bit trickier since it's Hermitian but its eigenstates are the |+⟩ and |−⟩ states, not the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So the expectation value of σ_x in the given state won't be as straightforward.

The expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ can be calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. Let's write out the state ψ as a vector. Since |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), the state is:

ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So, σ_x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Let's compute ψ† σ_x ψ.

Alternatively, there's a formula for expectation values of Pauli matrices. I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle in state (a, b), the expectation of σ_x is (a b* + a* b)/(a a* + b b*). Wait, but in this case, a and b are real numbers, so it's (2ab)/(a² + b²).

Let me compute that. a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So a*b is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. So 2ab is sqrt(3)/2. The denominator is (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. So ⟨σ_x⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2) / 1 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... So that's approximately 0.866.

But wait, let me think another way. The general formula for expectation of σ_x is (ψ_1 ψ_2* + ψ_2 ψ_1*) where ψ is [ψ_1; ψ_2]. Since all coefficients here are real, it's simply 2ψ_1 ψ_2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the exact formula. The operator σ_x is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you compute ψ† σ_x ψ, it's (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Multiplying σ_x with ψ gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then the dot product with [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the expectation value of σ_x is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Therefore, the expectation of 5σ_x is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the state is given as a superposition, and sigma_x is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues ±1, but its expectation depends on the state. So that's correct.

Now, putting it all together. The total expectation value is ⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, sigma_z's expectation is -0.5, so 10 times that is -5. And sigma_x's expectation is sqrt(3)/2, so 5 times that is (5 * sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (5 *1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈ 4.33.

So the total expectation is (-5) + 4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculations.

σ_z: 0.5^2 =0.25, (sqrt(3)/2)^2=0.75. So (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. 10 times that is -5.

σ_x: as calculated, sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, 5 times that is approximately 4.33.

So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67 approximately.

But wait, let me compute more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(3) exactly. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205080757. So, 5 * (1.73205080757)/2 = (5 * 1.73205080757)/2 = (8.66025403785)/2 = 4.330127018925.

So, 10σ_z expectation is -5, and 5σ_x is ~4.3301. So adding them together: -5 +4.3301 = -0.6699.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.6699. To one decimal place, that's -0.7. But wait, looking at the options, option C is -0.7. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

Wait, I got approximately -0.67. That's approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So option C.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the expectation value of sigma_x. Let me double-check that.

Wait, another method to find ⟨σ_x⟩ is to compute the components of the state. The state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation of σ_x is 2ab. Because the formula is ⟨σ_x⟩ = (a b* + a* b) when you have |ψ⟩ = [a; b]. Since a and b are real, that's 2ab.

So yes, 2ab in this case is 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2)*2 = 0.5 * sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So that's correct. So 5σ_x contributes 4.33 as before.

So the total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded. So option C is the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate anything. Is there a possibility that the expectation of sigma_x is (b a + a b), which is same as 2ab? Yes, because in the σ_x matrix, when you multiply, you get 2ab.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write out the full calculation.

Compute ψ† σ_x ψ:

ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]

σ_x ψ = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]

Then ψ† (σ_x ψ) is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems right. Therefore, the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. So the correct answer is C) -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of an operator is linear, so we compute the expectation values of \( 10\sigma_z \) and \( 5\sigma_x \) separately and then sum them.

### 1. Expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) of \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The probabilities of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the squares of the coefficients in the superposition:
- Probability of \( |\uparrow\rangle \): \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \),
- Probability of \( |\downarrow\rangle \): \( \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75 \).

The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
Thus, the expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5.
\]

### 2. Expectation value of \( 5\sigma_x \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix is:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( \psi \) is represented as a vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is calculated as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi = 2 \cdot (0.5) \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Thus, the expectation value of \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5 \cdot 0.866 = 4.33.
\]

### 3. Total expectation value
The total expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle + \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the result is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
