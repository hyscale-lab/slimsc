Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So the problem is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The question is about photometric observations showing brightness variations because the star is rotating, and the spots come into and out of view.

The interesting part is that this situation can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. The question is asking, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius? So, essentially, what's Rpl/Rstar?

Hmm. I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets works because when the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. So if the planet's radius is Rp and the star's radius is Rstar, the area ratio is (Rp/Rstar)^2. That gives the fraction of the star's light blocked, which would be the amplitude of the dip.

But wait, in this star spot scenario, the spots are causing a similar effect. When the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, so the observed brightness changes. Since the spots are cooler, they make the star a bit dimmer when they're visible. But how does that compare to a planet's transit?

Wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variation due to spots is similar to the exoplanet's transit. So we need to calculate which exoplanet radius would cause the same dip as the spots do.

First, let's model the situation. The star has a radius Rstar equal to the Sun's. Let's assume the Sun's radius is R_sun. So Rstar = R_sun.

The hemisphere is covered 20% by spots. Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere only. So when the star rotates, the spots are on the side that's facing us, and then they turn away. So the brightness variation is due to the spots being either visible or not.

The brightness variation arises because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the overall brightness is lower than when it's not. The amount of brightness change would depend on the area of the spots and how much cooler they are.

So to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots, I think we need to calculate the difference in flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not.

But wait, the star's total flux is based on its effective temperature. The total flux from the star without spots would be L = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. When there are spots, the flux is slightly reduced because the spots emit less.

But how much less? Let me think. The spots are only on one hemisphere. So the area of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere (so half the star's surface) that's covered by spots. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) ) / 2. Wait, no—the hemisphere's area is 2π R², because the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², and a hemisphere is half that. So the area of the hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, alternatively, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, the total area is 0.2 * (2π R²) )?
