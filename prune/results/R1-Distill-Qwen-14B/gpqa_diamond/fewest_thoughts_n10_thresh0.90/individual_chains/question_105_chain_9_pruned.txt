Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question is about how the brightness variations caused by a star with spots can be mimicked by an exoplanet, and we need to find the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the star. Hmm.

So, let me read the problem again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star = R_sun. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K.

When the star rotates, these spots come into view and then go out of view from our perspective. This modulation causes the observed brightness to vary. The question says this situation can resemble an exoplanet causing a dip in brightness when it transits the star.

But wait, the question is asking, if the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So we need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that of a planet transit.

The key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the amplitude) in both cases and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

Let me think about the two scenarios separately.

First, the spotted star. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, the star's total brightness is less. The brightness variation (delta) is the difference when spots are visible versus not.

The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πR^2σT^4. But since 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots, the effective area is reduced.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%—so the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots is 0.2. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, a hemisphere's area is 2πR². So the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, no, because when the star rotates, only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is the one facing us, the spots are visible; otherwise not.

The star emits
