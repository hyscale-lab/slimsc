Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that's a mix of acids and a strong base. I need to figure out what's going on here.

First, I'll write down the given information. The volumes and concentrations are:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. But wait, I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess. If there's excess H+ after neutralization, the solution will be acidic. If OH- is in excess, it'll be basic. If they perfectly neutralize, the pH would be 7.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each component.

For CH3COOH: It's a weak acid, and I think it dissociates into H+ and CH3COO- ions. But wait, since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully ionize. But for this problem, maybe I should consider it as a source of H+ only if needed after considering the strong acids and bases.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem involves mixing all three solutions. So, first, I'll find the moles of each solution.

Moles of CH3COOH: Molarity × Volume. But the volume is in mL, so I should convert to liters. 500 mL is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Moles of HCl: HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into H+ and Cl- ions. So 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl → 0.08 moles of H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So, 300 mL is 0.3 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release as much H+ as a strong acid. But when mixing with a strong base, I think the H+ from the strong acid will react with the OH- first. Then, any remaining H+ from the weak acid and any excess OH- will determine the pH.

Wait, let me structure this properly.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

When H+ and OH- react, they form water. So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the moles of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. Let's see which is in excess.

Total H+ available: 0.08 (from HCl) + whatever from CH3COOH.

Wait, but the CH3COOH is a weak acid and won't fully dissociate. But in the presence of a strong base, maybe the acetic acid's H+ will be negligible compared to the strong acid's H+? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the CH3COOH's H+ will react with the OH- from the base first, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all H+ sources (from HCl and CH3COOH) and all OH- (from Ba(OH)2), then calculate which is in excess.

But wait, the CH3COOH is a weak acid. So, in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid. Because the OH- is a strong base, it will react with the weak acid.

Wait, but that's more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the H+ from the strong acid (HCl) will first neutralize the OH- from the base.

Let me think: the strong acid's H+ will react with the strong base's OH-.

So, H+ (from HCl) is 0.08 moles.

OH- (from Ba(OH)2) is 0.18 moles.

So when they react, 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait, that's not the only source of H+. The CH3COOH can also release H+ (but weakly). So, after the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 have reacted, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with the acetic acid, which can act as a proton source.

So, CH3COOH is a weak acid, but when OH- is present, it will deprotonate it. So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH as follows: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So, the OH- left after reacting with HCl is 0.10 moles. How much CH3COOH do we have? 0.05 moles. So, the OH- will react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO-) and using up all the CH3COOH (since 0.05 is less than 0.10), leaving 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, no: the OH- is 0.10 moles, and CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. So, OH- will take all the CH3COOH's H+, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, after all reactions, we have 0.05 moles of OH- left.

Now, what is the total volume of the solution? Let's sum all the volumes:

500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, to find pH, I can first find pOH.

pOH = -log [OH-] = -log(0.04167).

Wait, let me calculate that. 0.04167 is approximately 4.167e-2. The log of 0.04 is about 1.39794, since 10^-1.39794 ≈ 0.04.

But more precisely, let's calculate it.

Alternatively, using a calculator:

log(0.04167) ≈ log(4.167e-2) = log(4.167) + log(1e-2) ≈ 0.619 + (-2) )= -1.381. So pOH is 1.381.

Wait, pOH = -log(0.04167) → which is same as log(1/0.04167) = log(24). Wait, 0.04167 is 1/24. Because 24 * 0.04167 is 1. So, 1/24 ≈ 0.04167. So log(24) is about 1.38.

So pOH ≈ 1.38.

Then, since pH + pOH = 14, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the pH would be approximately 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps because it's easy to mix up the reactions.

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

3. H+ and OH- react: 0.08 + 0.18 → neutralize 0.08 each, leaving 0.10 moles OH-.

4. Then, the OH- (0.10 moles) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). So, all CH3COOH is consumed, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

5. Total volume is 1.2 L, so [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

6. pOH = 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the correct answer is option A) 12.62.
