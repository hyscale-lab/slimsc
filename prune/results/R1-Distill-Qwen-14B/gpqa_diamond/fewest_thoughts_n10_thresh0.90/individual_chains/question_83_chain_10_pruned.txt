Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate these two pH values and match them to the options.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem step by step. 

First, we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. 

Diluting a solution changes its concentration. The formula I remember is M1V1 = M2V2. So before dilution, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. After adding 20 cm³, V2 is 0.04 L. So M2 would be (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. The initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. After diluting to 40 cm³, the concentration drops, but the moles don't change. So diluted solution is 0.025 M because 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. 

Wait, I think I got that right. So when titrating, the moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence would be the same as the moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. 

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, the first part asks for the pH at 25% titration. 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So that's the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration.

Let me think about what happens during the titration. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (a strong base) to form acetate (CH3COO⁻) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol. 

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% would be 2.5 cm³. Moles NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Right.

So initially, we have 0.001 mol of acetic acid. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the reaction will consume 0.00025 mol
