Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, I need to figure out the maximum orbital period of a second planet that would still allow both transit and occultation events. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period is 3 days. Then, there's a second planet with a radius 2.5 Earth radii. I need to find its maximum orbital period so that both transit and occultation happen.

Wait, transits and occultations. Transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we can't see its light, right? So for both to happen, the orbital periods must be such that the two planets are in the same orbital plane and their orbital periods are in a certain ratio, maybe?

I think the key is that the two planets must be in a situation where their orbital periods are such that their orbital motion brings them into alignment from our perspective. I remember something about orbital periods and the Hill sphere, but maybe that's not directly relevant here.

Wait, maybe it's about the synodic period. The synodic period is the time between similar configurations in the sky, like conjunctions. But how does that apply here? For both events to happen, the planets must align in such a way that one transits and the other occults. Or perhaps the timing is such that when one is transiting, the other is not, but over time, both events happen.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says the second planet will exhibit both transit and occultation events. So for each planet, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital periods allow them to transit and be occulted. Or perhaps for the second planet to also transit and be occulted by the star.

Wait, no, the first planet is already transiting. The second planet, to have both transit and occultation, must pass in front of the star (transit) and also be behind the star (occultation). Occultation would happen when the planet is on the other side of the star from our perspective.

So the orbital periods of the two planets must be such that one's orbital period is a multiple of the other, or perhaps their orbital periods are such that the ratio is not too far from 1, allowing these events to occur.

Wait, but how do their orbital periods relate to each other for this to happen? Maybe the ratio of their orbital periods should be such that their mean motions are in a ratio that allows them to catch up in position for the transit and occultation events.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about their orbital velocities and the relative positions. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the condition is that both planets must orbit within each other's Hill spheres for their orbits to be stable. But the question is about the maximum period, so maybe the other planet's orbit can't be too far in period, otherwise it wouldn't transit or occult.

Wait, another thought. For a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on enough so that the planet's orbit intersects the line of sight to the star. The impact parameter is 0.2 for the first planet. The impact parameter (b) is the distance, in units of the star's radius, from the center of the star to the center of the planet's path during transit.

So for the first planet, impact parameter b = 0.2. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii. So the distance from the center is 0.2 * 1.5 R_sun. So 0.3 R_sun. But I'm not sure how that helps with the second planet.

Wait, the second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. So when it transits, the star's radius is bigger relative to the planet. But how does this affect the transit depth? I think not directly for this question.

Perhaps the main point is about the orbital periods. The two planets must have orbital periods such that their relative motion allows them to transit and occult. For both transits and occultations, the orbital periods must be synchronized in some way.

Wait, let's think about occultation. For the planet to be occulted, it must pass behind the star from our point of view. That requires that when the planet is at the opposite side of the star, we can't see it. So, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that at some point, it's in the same line of sight behind the star.

But how does the period of the first planet (3 days) relate to that?

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the orbital period of the second planet must be longer than the first to allow them to be in different positions. But that doesn't directly make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the synodic period between the two planets must be such that their orbital periods are in a ratio that allows their positions to align for both events.

Wait, another approach: For both transit and occultation events to occur, the second planet must have an orbital period that is longer than the orbital period of the first planet. Because if the second is faster, it would orbit more quickly, but for occultation, perhaps the orbital period has to be longer so that it can get behind the star.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about orbital periods and the probability of transiting. The probability of a planet transiting is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, no, the transit probability is actually (R_star + R_planet) / a divided by the orbital inclination. Hmm, maybe not the right way to approach it.

Wait, perhaps the key is that for the second planet to also transit, its orbital period must be such that its semi
