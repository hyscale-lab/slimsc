Alright, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, okay, I need to figure out which of the provided stars meet the brightness criteria for both instruments.

First, I should understand the brightness requirements. The ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, brighter than 17—so that means apparent V mag less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter (lower mag), it fits. ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, again, lower magnitudes are better. So HIRES can see stars up to 16 mag.

So the star needs to have an apparent V magnitude that's ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16 to be visible by both. Because HIRES can't see beyond 16, so if a star is 17, HIRES can't see it but ESPRESSO can. So stars must have apparent V ≤16.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh! So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <16.

Wait, no, that's opposite. Wait, the way it's phrased: "brighter than 17" means V < 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So for ESPRESSO, a star is observable if V <17. For HIRES, V <16.

So the star must have V <16 to be observable by both. Because if V is 16, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. Wait, no, because the limit is brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO. So a V=16 is brighter than 17, so it's acceptable for ESPRESSO. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have V <16.

So any star with apparent V mag
