Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data and then determining the product after a reaction. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that Compound X has specific IR and NMR data. It then reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is typically used for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to form a carboxylic acid. Wait, or is it maybe for something else? Oh right, another reaction: maybe it's a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced. Alternatively, another common reaction with red phosphorus is the conversion of an alkyne to an alkyne acid... No, wait, maybe more accurately, red phosphorus and HI can be used to remove a leaving group, like in the case of a phosphorus tribromide reaction? Or wait, I think I might be mixing up reactions here. Let me recall. Oh wait, no. Red phosphorus with HI is often used for the hydrolysis of acid chlorides. Because when an acid chloride (like RCOCl) reacts with HI, it can produce RCOI (acid iodide), but that's not right. Alternatively, with water, acid chlorides can form carboxylic acids. But how does red phosphorus come into play? Oh, right! I think when an acid chloride reacts with water in the presence of red phosphorus, it can form the carboxylic acid. So maybe Compound X is an acid chloride, and upon reaction with HI, it becomes a carboxylic acid. Or wait, maybe the reaction is a different one. Another possibility is that Compound X is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by an iodide. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that part. Let me think more.

Looking at the IR data first. The IR shows strong peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either an O-H stretch (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or an N-H stretch (amines), but in this case, the peak around 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, so perhaps an ester (around 1740 typically), or maybe a carboxylic acid (which usually has a broad O-H stretch around 2500–3300). Wait, the IR data shows a peak at 3400–2500, which is a broad region, but the 1720 is sharp. So perhaps an ester, or maybe an acid chloride? Because acid chlorides have higher carbonyl peaks, around 1800s. Ester carbonyls are around 1740. Hmm, but 1720 is a bit lower than ester, more like maybe a ketone. Wait, no, wait, the 1720 could also be from a conjugated carbonyl group, like an aromatic ester or an acid. Wait, but let's not get stuck here yet, maybe the NMR will help more.

Looking at the NMR data: The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm usually suggests an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. But wait, a broad singlet could also be an exchange process, like an acidic proton such as in a carboxylic acid. But in the NMR, the peak is at 10.5. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a strongly deshielded environment, but that seems less likely. Wait, another possibility is that this is an O-H proton, maybe from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But for a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad and usually around 10-12 ppm. But wait, if this is the only peak in that region, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, looking at the other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like a pair of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, such as a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. Because in para substitution, the protons are typically split into two doublets. So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene, maybe with substituents on the ring.

Then, the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's try to parse these.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH, such as in an isopropyl group or maybe a branching point. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H) could be adjacent to each other, perhaps part of a CH-CH2- group. Let me think about this. So maybe a structure where there's a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a chain. Let's try to imagine the structure.

Putting it together: the benzene ring has a substituent that's a chain. For example, perhaps a phenyl group attached to a chain which ends with a carbonyl group. Because the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone or an acid.

Wait, if the IR has a peak around 3400–2500, which could be O-H for a carboxylic acid, but the NMR doesn't have a broad peak in that region except for the 10.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but then why the broadness? Hmm, perhaps the 10.5 is an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if the 10.5 is a carboxylic acid, then the IR peak at 1720 would make sense as a carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. Wait, but the NMR shows 10.5 ppm as one proton. The aromatic protons are 8.0 and 7.2, each two protons. So para substitution would mean two sets of two protons. So perhaps the substituent is a carboxylic acid at position 4, and another group at position 1. Wait, but then the substituent would be at the para position relative to each other.

Wait, the 1H NMR has 10.5 as a singlet, which is probably the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. So that would make sense. Then, the rest of the NMR would show the substituent on the benzene ring. Let me think about the substituent.

The NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H). Let's see: The 0.9 triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 doublet (3H) is likely a CH(CH3), because a doublet with 3H would be adjacent to a CH group. So perhaps a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Let me try to piece it together.

The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH group next to a CH2. So maybe the structure is CH2CH2... Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group attached to the ring. Let's think: the 1.7 (2H, m) could be a CH2 between two CH2 groups or maybe between a CH and a CH2. Hmm. Let me try to draw a possible structure.

Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent at position 4 (since the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, para substitution). The substituent could be a chain leading to a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? Wait, but the 0.9 is a triplet, which suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. Alternatively, maybe it's an isobutyl group.

Wait, another approach: the substituent attached to the benzene could be a chain that includes a carbonyl group, perhaps an ester, or a ketone. Let's see.

Wait, considering the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 (t, 3H): that could be a CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, the CH(CH3) would have a doublet. Let me think: the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which likely comes from a CH3 group attached to a CH. So, perhaps a structure like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would give the 1.4 as a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a CH2 that's connected to another CH2, ending with a CH3. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group? Or maybe a butyl group.

But wait, the 2.9 ppm (1H) is a multiplet, which could be the CH in the middle of a chain. Let me think of a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–, but wait, let's see. Alternatively, perhaps it's an isobutyl group: -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2C(CH3)2? No, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)– no, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recall: the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2–, but that doesn’t sound right. Alternatively, maybe it's the substituent is a butyl group attached in a way that the CH is in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? But that would mean a tert-butyl group, which would have a singlet for the 9H attached to the central carbon. But in the NMR, we only have 3H as a doublet. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a secondary butyl group, like a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, perhaps it's a pentyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a methyl group.

Wait, let's think about the coupling. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be adjacent to the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). So maybe a chain like CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but the 0.9 is a triplet, which would come from a CH2CH3 group at the end. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-... Hmm.

Wait, let's piece it together. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So, the structure is CH(CH3). Then, the adjacent group is CH2. So, maybe it's CH2-CH(CH3). The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH in the middle. Then, the next group would be another CH2 (the 1.7 ppm, 2H). Then, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) would be the CH2CH3 at the end. So the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would be a pentyl group. Wait, no, that's more like a pentyl group but let's count the carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a methyl. Let me think: the substituent could be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- ... Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another approach.

Another thought: the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to a CH group. The 2.9 ppm (1H) is that CH group. So the structure could be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane ring, but that's less likely.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Then, the 1.4 ppm would be the CH3 attached to CH, the 2.9 would be the CH, and the 1.7 would be another CH2. Wait, but where does that lead? Let me imagine the structure. The benzene ring has a substituent that is a chain: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's a longer chain. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let's consider if the substituent is a butyl group. The NMR for a butyl group would have:

- The terminal CH3 as a triplet (0.9, triplet), which matches the 0.9 ppm peak.

- The adjacent CH2 (to the CH3) would be a quartet (but the 1.7 is a multiplet, perhaps because of coupling with adjacent groups).

- The middle CH2 (next to the CH(CH3)) would be a triplet or a multiplet.

Wait, but in this case, the 1.7 is 2H as a multiplet,
