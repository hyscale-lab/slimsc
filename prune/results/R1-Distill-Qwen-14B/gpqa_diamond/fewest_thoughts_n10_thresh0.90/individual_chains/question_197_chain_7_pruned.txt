--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me the IR and NMR data for Compound X. It says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the final product is and choose the correct option from A to D.

First, I should probably look at the spectroscopic data to determine what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can figure out what reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let's start with the IR data. The IR shows strong peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region usually indicates an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Another strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a high wavenumber, which I remember is typically a carbonyl group (C=O). So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peak at 1610 cm-1 might suggest some conjugation, like an aromatic ring with substituents. The 1450 cm-1 peak—could that be related to the aromatic ring as well? Maybe C=C stretching.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because alcohols usually don't show up that high; their protons are around 1-5 ppm. So this makes me think maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative. The broad signal suggests it's exchangeable, which fits with a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but looking back at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 could be the carbonyl from a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have strong O-H (which shows up in IR around 2500–3300 as a broad peak) and a strong C=O around 1700 cm-1. So that fits.

So, the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group. Let me think about the rest of the NMR.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, each set of protons is equivalent and couples with two neighboring protons, giving a doublet. So the 8.0 ppm is probably the two protons ortho to the substituent, and the 7.2 ppm is the two para. Wait, no, actually, in para substitution, each pair is a doublet. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho, and 3 and 5 meta? Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of coupling.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are either in the ortho positions or para to the substituent. Let's say the substituent is at position 1. Then positions 2 and 6 are ortho, 3 and 5 are meta, and 4 is para. But the substituent is at 1, so the H's at 2 and 6 would be a pair of doublets.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine a substituent in the para position. Let's say the substituent is at position 4 of the benzene ring. Then, the protons adjacent (positions 3 and 5) would be meta to the substituent. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

In a para-disubstituted benzene, the two substituents are across from each other. But in this case, the substituent may be at position 4, and the ring has another group. Wait, maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene. Let me think differently.

The NMR shows two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So the aromatic region is split into two doublets, each for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene. For example, if the substituent is in the para position relative to another substituent. Or perhaps, the substituent is in one position, and the ring has another substituent in the para position. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a single group, making the ring monosubstituted, and the protons are split into two doublets due to coupling with adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted ring, but that usually leads to more complex splitting. No, if it's para, each pair of equivalent protons would be a doublet.

So, the aromatic ring has substituents such that the ring protons are split into two doublets. Let's say the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid at position 4. Then, the H's at positions 3 and 5 would be ortho to the substituent, and H's at 2 and 6 would be meta. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the NMR shifts.

The 8.0 ppm is likely the protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. The 7.2 ppm would be the para protons or maybe meta. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an electron-donating group, but the 10.5 ppm suggests a strong deshielded proton, which is probably the carboxylic acid.

So, putting it together, the aromatic ring has a carboxylic acid group in the para position relative to another substituent. Wait, but the aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H. So if the substituent is at position 4, then the ring would have two ortho protons (positions 3 and 5) and two para protons (positions 2 and 6?), but I'm not quite getting it. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent at position 1, and the ring has another substituent at position 4. Wait, but that's for disubstituted.

Wait, another approach: looking at the rest of the NMR.

Looking at other peaks:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, probably from a CH group next to another CH, maybe in a CH2CH2 group. Or perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. But wait, the compound has a carboxylic acid, so perhaps it's an ester? Or maybe the CH is part of a side chain attached to the aromatic ring.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This could be a CH2 group next to another CH2, perhaps in an ethyl chain. Or it could be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet, which is probably a methyl group attached to a CH. Like a CH(CH3) group. Wait, because a triplet (d, 3H) would imply it's next to a CH2, but a doublet with 3H is a methyl attached to a CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H, which is usually a terminal CH3 in an ethyl group.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is a benzoic acid with a substituent on the benzene ring that is a branched chain. Let's think about the substituent.

So, the substituent after the benzene ring might be a chain like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- or something. Wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which could be a CH2 next to another CH2 or a CH. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, perhaps a CH next to a CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group, but the NMR doesn't fit that. Wait, then there's the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which would be a methyl group attached to a CH group. So perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group or a butyl group.

Wait, let's try to build the structure.

The NMR shows:

- Carboxylic acid proton at 10.5 ppm (1H, broad singlet). So, the structure has a COOH group.

- Aromatic protons: two doublets, each 2H. So the substituent is in the para position relative to another substituent, but perhaps the substituent is an alkoxy group or a carbonyl group.

Wait, actually, the COOH is a substituent on the benzene ring. Then, the ring would have another substituent. Looking at the NMR, perhaps the substituent is a chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-ethylbenzoic acid. But that wouldn't fit the NMR data, because the substituent would be ethyl, but in that case, the CH2CH3 would produce a triplet and a quartet in NMR, but in our data, I don't see that. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a longer chain.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH3. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to that. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to the aromatic ring. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is another CH3 attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Because then, the structure would look like:

Phenyl ring with COOH at position 4, and a substituent at position 1 that is a CH2-CH(CH3)- something.

Wait, let me sketch it out:

The substituent on the benzene ring is at position 1: maybe a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, the substituent would be something like -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, because that would have more hydrogens. Let me think again.

Looking at the NMR:

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 end. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that's not matching with the other data.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2... Or maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group? Let me see. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. But that might not be right either.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-2 group. Wait, that's isopropyl. But then, the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 in isopropyl, but in our data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d,3H), which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, not a CH2. So perhaps it's a -CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring.

Wait, but then how does the rest of the chain look? Let's think step by step.

The NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): likely a CH2CH2CH3 group, so this would be an ethyl group attached to something.

Wait, but if the substituent is a butyl group, perhaps. Let's think about that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Let me think: a propyl group would have a CH2CH2CH3. So the NMR would show a triplet at 1.2 ppm (the middle CH2), a quartet at 1.7 ppm (the CH2 next to the CH3), and a triplet at 0.9 ppm (the terminal CH3). But in our data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, and 0.9 ppm is a triplet. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is another CH3 attached to a CH.

Hmm, maybe it's a chain like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be a pentyl group? No, perhaps a more branched chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: if the substituent is an isopropyl group, the NMR would show a singlet for the two CH3 groups attached to the same CH. But in our data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d,3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH, not a CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-, which would imply a structure like benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, wait, the COOH is on the benzene.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline the possible structure.

Looking at the NMR:

- The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents? Or perhaps one substituent (like a COOH) and another substituent which is an alkyl chain.

Wait, the COOH is at position 4, and the substituent is another group in the para position. Alternatively, the substituent could be in the meta or ortho position relative to the COOH.

Wait, if the substituent is a chain, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. Let me think: if the benzene has a COOH group at position 1, then substituent at position 4 would be a CH2CH(CH3)... but not sure.

Let me think about the substituent chain.

The substituent chain has:

- A CH group (which is the 2.9 ppm peak: 1H, m)
- A CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H, m)
- A CH3 group attached to a CH (1.4 ppm, d, 3H)
- And a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H)

Wait, that seems like a chain that's four carbons long, perhaps. Let me try to imagine:

The substituent on the benzene is a group like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group, which would have a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, another approach: consider all the NMR signals to build the structure.

Starting with the COOH at 10.5 ppm.

The aromatic protons are two doublets, 2H each. So, perhaps the substituent is at position 4 of the benzene ring, and the ring has another substituent at position 1, making it a di-substituted benzene. But that doesn't fit with the NMR data, because in that case, the aromatic protons might be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a chain attached to the benzene in such a way that the adjacent protons are split into two doublets. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, and the ring is para to another group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that would give a CH(CH3)2 group, but the NMR doesn't seem to show that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, leading to a longer chain. Let me think about the possible structure.

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is probably a CH2CH2CH3 group attached to a CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)3CH3, a butyl group. Let me think: if it's a butyl group, the NMR would show a triplet at 0.9 ppm (the terminal CH3), a quartet at 1.7 ppm (the next CH2), a triplet at 1.4 ppm (the middle CH2), and a quartet at 2.9 ppm (the CH2 attached to the benzene). But that doesn't exactly fit the data.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d,3H), which indicates that the CH3 is attached to a CH, not a CH2. So perhaps it's a -CH(CH3)- group attached to a CH2.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So the substituent would be a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about that.

A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. The structure of a sec-butyl group is actually -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that might not be right. Wait, let me clarify: the structure of isobutyl is -CH2-CH(CH3)2, but sec-butyl is -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let me think about the NMR of a sec-butyl group.

In a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that can't be right because that would be a pentyl group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group. But that's a tertiary carbon, and the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups. But in our data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d,3H), which would not be a singlet. So, probably not a tert-butyl.

Wait, maybe it's an isopropyl group. The isopropyl group is CH(CH3)2. The NMR of isopropyl would show a septet for the central CH, but in our data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because isopropyl's central CH would be a septet due to coupling with six equivalent protons.

But in our data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (m, 1H), which suggests that the CH is next to two different CH groups, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that would have more protons in certain regions.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the substituent is an ethyl group with a methyl branch.

So, the structure would be benzene ring with COOH at position 4 and a substituent at position 1 which is CH2-CH(CH3)- something.

Wait, but then what's the rest of the chain?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. That would be a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to another CH2.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about the overall structure.

The compound has a benzene ring with a COOH group (from the NMR and IR data). Another substituent is a chain that leads to the 2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm signals.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is 4-(3-methylbut-1-enyl)benzoic acid. Wait, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ethyl group with a branch. Let me think about the substituent as being a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So that would be a 2-methylpropyl group? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think of the substituent as a four-carbon chain with a methyl branch.

So, the substituent could be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would make a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Then the NMR would have the CH3 at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, another approach: look at the options and see which structure matches the data.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, let's analyze each option.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the structure would be benzoic acid (COOH) attached to a benzene ring, and a sec-butyl group at the para position.

Wait, but wait, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the substituent at position 4. Let me think about the structure.

The benzene ring has COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The substituent is a sec-butyl group: which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- ??? No, wait. The butyl group can be straight or branched.

The sec-butyl group is actually -(CH2)CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, perhaps I should get the correct structure.

Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. No, wait, that's not correct. Let me clarify.

Butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (straight chain)
- iso-butyl: CH(CH3)2CH2 (I think, but actually, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-)
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)CH2-

Wait, actually, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, perhaps the confusion is better addressed by remembering that sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-. So, the substituent would be a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene ring.

In that structure, the substituent would have the following groups:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene.
- Then a CH(CH3) group.
- Then another CH2 group.
- And a terminal CH3.

Wait, but then the NMR would show signals for each of these.

The CH(CH3) would be the middle CH. The CH2 groups would be adjacent to each other.

So, in the NMR, the CH(CH3) would show up as a multiplet due to coupling with adjacent CH2 groups. Let's see.

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that would be a pentyl group, not butyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the substituent as a sec-butyl group: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that can't be right because that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent's NMR.

In the substituent, the groups are:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene ring (the first CH2).
- Then a CH group (the second carbon) attached to a methyl group (from the CH(CH3) part).
- Then another CH2 group (third carbon) attached to CH3 (fourth carbon).

Wait, maybe the substituent's structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But that would be a pentyl group, not a butyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

In that case, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group.

So, substituent structure: benzene ring connected to CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

But wait, that's a four-carbon chain. So, the substituent would be a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at each option.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure is a benzene ring with COOH at position 4 and a sec-butyl group. Wait, no, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the COOH at position 1 and the sec-butyl group at position 4. So the substituents are para to each other.

Wait, then what would the NMR look like?

The aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted benzene, so two doublets each integrating 2H. That matches the given NMR data.

Then, looking at the substituent's NMR.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain, making it a propyl group with a branch. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that would be a longer chain. Maybe I should think of the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

In that structure, the substituent is:

- Benzene ring - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH3.

Wait, that would make a pentyl group, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring at the para position relative to the COOH group.

The substituent structure would be:

Benzoic acid (COOH) at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- (but I'm not sure if that's correct
