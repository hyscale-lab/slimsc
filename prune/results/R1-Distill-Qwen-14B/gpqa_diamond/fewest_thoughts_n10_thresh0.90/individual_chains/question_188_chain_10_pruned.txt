Okay, so I have this crystallography problem to solve. Hmm, it's about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal. Let's see what I remember.

The problem states that it's a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And we need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. I think rhombohedral crystals are a type of Bravais lattice. Right, and in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal, a = b = c, and all angles are equal too. So in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and each angle is 30 degrees.

I remember that the interplanar distance d is given by the formula derived from the unit cell. The general formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + ... wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ can be found using the reciprocal of the metric tensor. Oh, the formula is:

d² = (a² (h² + k² + l²) - a² (h² cos² α + k² cos² β + l² cos² γ + 2hk cos α cos β cos γ + ... )) Wait, no, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, there's a simpler formula when all a, b, c are equal and all angles are equal, like in a rhombohedral system. Oh right, for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance for (hkl) planes is given by d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk( cos α ) - hk( cos β ) - hk( cos γ ) ) ... Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the Miller indices.

Alternatively, I recall the formula for d in terms of the unit cell parameters. The general expression for interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2hk cos γ)/(a²) + ... Wait, no, that might not be correct. Maybe I should start from the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system? Ok, the metric tensor g is a 3x3 matrix which relates the reciprocal lattice vectors to the direct lattice vectors. The elements are:

g11 = a²
g22 = a²
g33 = a²
g12 = g13 = g23 = a² (cos γ) ?

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so cos α, cos β, cos γ are the same. Oh yeah, because alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees here.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are all the same. So, the metric tensor would have off-diagonal terms involving cos(30 degrees). Let me write that out.

The metric tensor g is:

[ a²            a² cos γ      a² cos γ ]
[ a² cos γ      a²            a² cos γ ]
[ a² cos γ      a² cos γ      a²       ]

But wait, for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and all angles equal, the g tensor is symmetric and each off-diagonal term is a² cos γ, where gamma is 30 degrees here.

Now, the interplanar distance d for (hkl) planes is given by:

d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a² - (h k + h l + k l) (cos γ) / a²

Wait, because the reciprocal of the metric tensor is involved. Oh right, the formula for d is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) * (1/a²) - (h k (cos γ) + h l (cos γ) + k l (cos γ)) / a² )

This can be rewritten as:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - (h k + h l + k l) cos γ )

So in our case, h = k = l = 1 for (111) plane.

So let's plug in the numbers.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So,

d = a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 - (1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos 30° )

a is 10 Angstroms.

Compute the denominator's inside:

Sum of squares is 3.

The terms (hk + hl + kl) = (1 + 1 + 1) = 3.

So,

denominator inside sqrt becomes 3 - 3 * cos(30° )

Wait, cos(30 degrees) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 3 * cos30 = 3 * 0.8660 ≈ 2.598.

So 3 - 2.598 = 0.402.

So sqrt(0.402) is sqrt(0.402) ≈ 0.634.

So d = 10 / 0.634 ≈ ?

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, 3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - (3*sqrt(3))/2.

Let me compute that more accurately.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205.

So 3*sqrt(3) = 5.19615. Divided by 2 is 2.59808.

3 - 2.59808 = 0.40192.

So the denominator is sqrt(0.40192). Let me compute sqrt(0.40192).

Hmm, sqrt(0.40192) is approximately 0.634.

So 10 / 0.634 is approximately 15.77? Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 9 Angstroms.

Wait, wait a second. I think I messed up the formula. Because I remember that the general formula for d in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos gamma )

Wait, but in some references, the formula includes a factor of 2 for the cos gamma terms. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me check the formula again. I think I might have used the wrong expression.

Alternatively, the correct formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk (cos α + cos beta + cos gamma) + ... ) Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

Wait, the correct formula for d is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) (1/a²) - (h k cos gamma + h l cos gamma + k l cos gamma) (1/a²) )

Which simplifies to:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - (h k + h l + k l) cos gamma )

Yes, that's the same as before. So plugging in the numbers again:

h=k=l=1.

Denominator inside the sqrt: 3 - 3 cos30.

Which is 3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - (3*sqrt(3)/2 )

Compute this:

3 is 6/2 (since 3=6/2). So 6/2 - (3*sqrt(3)/2 ) = (6 - 3 sqrt(3)) / 2.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( (6 - 3 sqrt(3)) / 2 )

Wait, wait, no: because the denominator inside the sqrt is (3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)).

= 3 (1 - sqrt(3)/2 )

Wait, 3 (1 - 0.8660) = 3*(0.13395) ≈ 0.40185.

So sqrt(0.40185) ≈ 0.634.

So d = 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.77 Angstroms. But that's way larger than the options given, which are around 9 Angstroms. So that can't be right.

Wait, this suggests I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal.

Another approach is to use the general formula for d in terms of the unit cell parameters. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( [h² (1/a²) + k² (1/b²) + l² (1/c²)] + [ 2 h k cos gamma / (a b) ) + ... ] )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and the angles are all equal. So perhaps the formula simplifies.

Wait, another way: the general formula for d in a crystal with unit cell parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d² = (h²/l²) (1/a²) + ... No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of the metric tensor.

The reciprocal of the metric tensor is involved. The (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vector (h k l). The formula for d is given by 1/d² = (h² g11 + k² g22 + l² g33 + 2 hk g12 + 2 hl g13 + 2 kl g23 ) / (g11 g22 g33) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the approach wrong. Let me find the correct formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - a^2 (h^2 cos^2 α + k^2 cos^2 β + l^2 cos^2 γ) + ... ) ?

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a² - (h k cos gamma + h l cos gamma + k l cos gamma)/a².

Wait, that would lead to:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos gamma ] / a².

So,

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl ) cos gamma )

Wait, that's what I did earlier. But that led to a result of ~15.77, which isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Let me reevaluate. Wait, 1/d² = ( ... ) so d² = 1/( ... ), which would make d smaller, not larger.

Wait, no, the formula says 1/d² equals that expression,
