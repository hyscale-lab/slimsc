Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let me think this through step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main structure seems to have a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a carbonyl group (the aldehyde) and a hydroxymethyl group (the (hydroxy)methyl part), which is also connected to another cyclohexyl group. So, I guess the structure is something like a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a -CH₂CHO (the aldehyde part) and the other is a -CH(OH)- connected to a cyclohexyl group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. So, the molecule is cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡CH? Or wait, ethynyl is the substituent, so it's cyclohexane with a triple bond. Let me visualize: cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a ethynyl group. So, perhaps it's CH₂CH₂C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane? No, wait. Ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane attached to a -C≡CH group. So, it's cyclohexyl-ethyne: cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡CH? Or maybe cyclohexane with a triple bond directly attached. Wait, I think I need to get that right.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond terminus. So, it's like cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl would be -C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a -C≡CH group. So, it's cyclohexyl-ethyne.

I need to figure out how to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's outline what needs to happen. The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group connected to another cyclohexyl. So, perhaps the synthesis involves some kind of reduction, oxidation, and maybe some cyclopropane formation or something else.

Let me think about the reactions. Ethynylcyclohexane is a sp-hybridized carbon attached to the cyclohexane. I remember that triple bonds can undergo various reactions—like hydroboration, hydration, or other additions.

Looking at the reagents in the options for each step. The options all have multiple steps, so I need to figure out each step's purpose.

Looking at the options, each starts with NaNH2 and something. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. It's often used for deprotonation, especially for acidic protons. For example, in alkyne chemistry, NaNH2 can deprotonate a terminal alkyne to form a strong base, which can then react with an alkyl halide in an alkylation reaction.

So perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane, making it a strong base. Then, maybe an alkylation occurs. Let's think.

Ethynylcyclohexane under NaNH2 would deprotonate to form a cyclohexyl-ethynide ion. Then, if you add methyl chloride (CH3Cl), you could alkylate the alkyne. Wait, but methyl chloride is a good alkylating agent. So, the ethynide would attack CH3Cl, adding a methyl group. So, the alkyne becomes CH2CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, no, wait. The initial structure is cyclohexane attached to a C≡CH. Deprotonating would give cyclohexane-CH-⁻C≡C⁻. Then, adding CH3Cl would give cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, but that would be adding a methyl group to the triple bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, because two alkyl groups are added? No, wait. The ethynide (a strong base) would react with methyl chloride to form a new bond. So, the structure after alkylation would be the cyclohexyl group attached to a -C≡C-CH3 group. Because the ethynide has a negative charge on the sp-hybridized carbon, so adding CH3Cl would substitute the H, giving a -C≡C-CH3 group.

Wait, wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. No, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent that's an ethynyl group. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group directly attached? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so it would be attached directly to the cyclohexane. So, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH, right? No, no, wait. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane substituted with an ethynyl group. So, that would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait. Ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, it's cyclohexane with a substituent -C≡CH. So, it's similar to benzene with a -C≡CH group. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, maybe it's cyclohexane attached directly to the triple bond: cyclohexane-C≡CH. I think that's correct. So, the starting material is a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH substituent.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, NaNH2 is a strong base. It would deprotonate the terminal alkyne. The triple bond is -C≡CH; the H is acidic, so deprotonated to form a cyclohexyl-ethynide ion. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is an alkylating agent. The ethynide (-C≡C⁻) would attack CH3Cl, leading to substitution: -C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but wait. When you have a terminal alkyne, deprotonating gives the acetylide ion, which is strong base. When you treat that with an alkyl halide, you add an alkyl group to the acetylide. So, in this case, the acetylide will attack methyl chloride, adding a methyl group to the triple bond. So the product would have a -C≡C-CH3 group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but wait. The starting alkyne is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. After deprotonation, it's cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻. Then, adding CH3Cl would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, the triple bond is now converted to a single bond with two methyl groups? No, wait. Wait, the alkyne was -C≡CH. Deprotonation gives -C≡C⁻. Then, CH3Cl (which has CH3+) would give substitution: the alkyne becomes -C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's a triple bond between two carbons, each attached to a CH3 and cyclohexane? So, it's cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. But wait, that would be a longer chain, not a substitution. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group is added to the cyclohexane. Hmm, no, because the acetylide is on the alkyne, not the cyclohexane. So the methyl would attach to the alkyne. So, after step 1, what's the structure? It's cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but that's a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is added to the cyclohexane. But I don't think so, because the acetylide is on the alkyne. So, the alkyne becomes a longer alkyne.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the alkyne as R-C≡CH, where R is cyclohexyl.

Then, NaNH2 deprotonates to R-C≡C⁻. Then, CH3Cl would alkylate to R-C≡C-CH3. So, the triple bond is now between two carbons, each attached to a methyl and a R (cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, but that would require adding two methyl groups? No, just one. So the product after step 1 would be R-C≡C-CH3. That would be a substituted alkyne, where the triple bond is between two carbons, each attached to R and CH3.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is added to the cyclohexane. Hmm, perhaps the alkyne is at a different position. Maybe I'm getting confused about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is in a different position. Let's think of the starting material as ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH.

So, after step 1, with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, the alkyne becomes -C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2 in the options varies. Let's look at the options:

Option A: step 2 is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation, which would reduce triple bonds to single bonds. So, if we have R-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would make R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that would be a single bond; but the product we need is an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right path.

Option B: step 2 is Li/liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used for elimination or deprotonation. Wait, maybe for forming alkenes through deprotonation and elimination? Or perhaps it's for forming a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Option C: step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's a hydrogenation catalyst, perhaps for partial hydrogenation. Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) to cis-alkene with Lindlar catalyst? Or perhaps, wait, Pd-CaCO3 is used for hydrogenation to single bonds, like alkynes to alkanes. So, if we have R-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Option D: step 2 is Li/liquid NH3. Same as option B.

Wait, but let's think about the target molecule. It has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group connected to a cyclohexyl ring. So, perhaps the alkyne needs to be converted into a ketone or aldehyde, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, how? Ozonolysis comes to mind. Ozonolysis of an alkyne would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne would give a diketone? Or maybe a ketone and a carboxylic acid, depending on conditions.

Wait, let's think about the overall process. The target has a cyclohexane with two substituents: one is a -CH₂CHO group (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde), and the other is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl.

So the starting molecule is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps the plan is to:

1. Convert the alkyne into a diol, then oxidize to a carbonyl group.

But wait, how?

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is functionalized in some way to introduce a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone. If the alkyne is R-C≡C-R', hydrogenation would make R-CH₂-CH₂-R'. But that's an alkane; perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. Let me think about that.

Another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CH₂CHO group and a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is part of a larger ring, and we're doing some ring-opening or ring-forming reactions.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is used in a cycloaddition reaction, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol via some hydration, then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but how?

Wait, another thought: If the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then perhaps subjected to dihydroxylation or other reactions.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are four sequences, each with four steps. Let me consider each option's steps.

Option A: Steps are:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, step 3 is Ba(OH)2. That's a strong base, perhaps for elimination or epoxidation? Or maybe for oxidation. H2SO4 with HgSO4 and H2O is a typical Jones oxidation condition, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.

So, putting it together:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and CH3Cl. As discussed earlier, forms cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd: hydrogenation of the alkyne to alkane, so cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a straight chain, perhaps not helpful. Then, step 3: Ba(OH)2. Maybe for elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Or maybe it's for epoxide opening? Not sure.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be for forming epoxides—no, that's usually done with peracids.

Hmm, not sure. Then step 4 is Jones oxidation, which would oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, secondary to ketones. But in this case, after step 2, the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. If step 3 is some kind of oxidation or elimination, perhaps adding OH groups.

Wait, maybe I'm not on the right track. Let me look at option D.

Option D: Steps are:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a methylating agent. So, same as step 1 in option A: ethynide formed and then methylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base and used for elimination reactions, perhaps to form alkenes. So, if R-C≡C-CH3 is treated with Li/NH3, perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated and then undergoes elimination? Wait, but after methylating, the triple bond is R-C≡C-CH3. If we treat with Li/NH3, which is a very strong base, we could deprotonate and then eliminate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction? No, Birch is for aromatic rings.

Alternatively, maybe the Li/NH3 is for deprotonating and then doing some alkylation, but I'm not certain.

Moving on, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. But if the alkyne hasn't been hydrogenated yet, maybe it's not applicable. So perhaps after step 2, there's an alkene formed.

Wait, maybe step 2 is deprotonation and elimination to form a trans-alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reductive workup in ozonolysis.

Let me think how that would work. So, step 1: R-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: treatment with Li/NH3, which is a strong base, could cause elimination. But wait, R-C≡C-CH3 doesn't have adjacent Hs to eliminate. Alternatively, perhaps we're deprotonating the alkyne and then doing some alkylation elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up steps. Let me think of the target molecule. It has an aldehyde group, which is a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne needs to be converted into a carbonyl. Ozonolysis of an alkyne would form two carbonyls. For example, ozonolysis of R-C≡C-R' would give R-O and R'-O, but that's under specific conditions. Alternatively, ozonolysis of internal alkynes can give diketones, or other products depending on the conditions.

Wait, but in this case, after step 1 and 2, maybe we have an alkene. So, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene.

Wait, let me think again. Let's take option C.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of what? If step 2 produced an alkane, then ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track. Let me think again about the target. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) and a CH₂CHO group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, then one OH is oxidized to a carbonyl, and another is used for another function.

Wait, another approach: The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a CH₂CHO group via some oxidation.

Wait, let's think about the overall process. Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group. But how?

I know that ozonolysis of an alkyne can give carbonyl compounds. For example, ozonolysis of an internal alkyne can produce two carbonyl groups. But wait, if the alkyne is R-C≡C-R', ozonolysis would produce R-CO and R'-CO groups, depending on the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is subjected to hydration to form a ketone. For example, acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne can produce a ketone. But that requires an internal alkyne. Our starting material is a terminal alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH).

Wait, but when you have a terminal alkyne, under certain conditions, it can be hydrated to form an aldehyde. Wait, no, I think acid-catalyzed hydration of a terminal alkyne gives a ketone. Wait, no: for example, H2SO4 and HgSO4 (hydration catalyst) on a terminal alkyne leads to ketone formation. Wait, let me think: hydration of a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH) with H2SO4 and HgSO4 gives R-COCH3? No, wait, no, I think it would produce R-COH2. Wait, no, actually, I think that the acid-catalyzed hydration of a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH) gives an enol, which tautomerizes to a ketone (R-CO-R'), but that depends on the structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: under acidic conditions, a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH) can be protonated, leading to the formation of a vinyl carbocation, which can then get attacked by water to form an enol, which can tautomerize to a ketone. So, the product would be R-CO-R', but in this case, the R' is just H. Wait, no. If the alkyne is R-C≡CH, after hydration, would it form R-CH₂-COOH? Or R-COCH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm a bit rusty on this.

Alternatively, another possibility: the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, but that requires magnesium, which isn't in any of the steps in the options.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then into an aldehyde. But how?

Another approach: The target molecule has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps the alkyne is oxidized to a diketone, and then reduced in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via some other means.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation to form a vicinal diol, and then oxidized.

Let me think: step 1: alkyne methylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's just an alkane; not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation to an alkene. Wait, but with what catalyst? Lindlar's catalyst would hydrogenate an alkyne to cis-alkene. But in option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which would fully hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. So that's not helpful for forming an alkene.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's steps:

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → forms R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps elimination to form an alkene. Wait, but R-C≡C-CH2CH3 doesn't have adjacent Hs to eliminate, so maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the Li/NH3 is for deprotonating and forming a strong base, which could then, perhaps, undergo another reaction. But I'm not sure.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis, but if the molecule is R-C≡C-CH2CH3, then after step 2, perhaps it's an alkene somewhere else. Not sure.

Alternatively, step 3: O3/H2O would break any double bonds into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → maybe a reductive workup, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → same as step 1 in A and C: forms R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonation and elimination. But again, R-C≡C-CH3 doesn't have adjacent Hs, so elimination may not be possible.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. If there's a double bond, it would be cleaved. But if the prior step didn't form a double bond, this step would do nothing.

4. NH4OH → maybe to reduce any ozonides? Not sure.

Wait, let me think about the target structure again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and a CH₂-CHO group. So, maybe the substituent is a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl and a -CH₂-CHO.

Wait, but that's two substituents on a single carbon? No, because the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, perhaps the substituent is a -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring, and another aldehyde group.

Wait, maybe the structure is better written as cyclohexane with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a -CHO group attached to the same carbon. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a substituent that is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) and a -CH₂CHO. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH₂CHO group and a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group connected to the same carbon. So, that carbon is attached to both substituents: one aldehyde and one hydroxymethyl connected to cyclohexane.

If that's the case, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a di-substituted carbon, with an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe the alkyne is converted into a geminal diol, then one OH is oxidized to a carbonyl, and the other is somehow modified into a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone, then the ketone is subjected to some reaction to form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think about each option's steps.

Option D: After step 1, we have R-C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is Li in liquid ammonia. Maybe that's a Birch reduction? No, Birch reduces aromatic rings, not alkanes. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by elimination, but I don't see an H to eliminate.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, but I don't see Mg in any of the steps. So that's probably not it.

Option B: step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So that would form R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Maybe elimination to form an alkene. But R-C≡C-CH2CH3 doesn't have adjacent Hs for elimination, so perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe Li/NH3 is used for other purposes, like forming a cuprate, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl group is not added to the alkyne, but to the cyclohexane. Hmm, that would require some kind of alkylation on the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration. So, perhaps step 1 is addition of a methyl group, then step 2 is hydrogenation to an alkene, followed by dihydroxylation to form a diol, which is then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the target molecule. It has an aldehyde group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)-cyclohexyl). So, perhaps the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the hydroxymethyl comes from some addition.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. And another part becomes the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but how would that happen?

Another thought: Maybe the alkyne is subjected to hydroboration to form a vinyl borane, which upon oxidation gives an alcohol. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (e.g., with OsO4) to form a vicinal diol, which can then be oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them list OsO4 or other dihydroxylation reagents. So perhaps that's not the path.

Wait, another option: Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis. For example, if the alkyne is converted into a diketone, then one of the ketones is reduced to an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that would fit with the options given.

Wait, let's think about option D again. Steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps deprotonation and elimination to form an alkene. But R-C≡C-CH3 doesn't have Hs for elimination.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe after step 1, we have R-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2, treatment with Li/NH3, which is a strong base, could deprotonate the methyl group, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is treated in a way to form a trans-alkene via deprotonation and elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Li/NH3 is for some kind of cyclopropane formation, but that's speculative.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the target and the steps needed to get there.

The target molecule has two substituents on the cyclohexane: a -CH₂CHO and a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a diol via some process, then the diol is oxidized to form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a glycol (diol) via hydration, then each OH is transformed into different groups.

But how? Let's see:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → treated with HgSO4/H2SO4 (hydration) → forms cyclohexyl-ethanol? No, wait. Hydration of a terminal alkyne typically gives a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH) treated with H2SO4 and HgSO4 would give R-CO-R', but in this case, R' is H, so it would give R-CO-H, which is a ketone (R-CO-).

Wait, that's not helpful, because the target has an aldehyde. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, then quenched to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the options don't include Mg, a typical Grignard reagent precursor.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then the ketone is converted into an aldehyde via some reduction and oxidation.

Wait, but ketones are not directly reduced to aldehydes. They are reduced to secondary
