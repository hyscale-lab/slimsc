--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, I remember that ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond, so maybe some kind of addition reaction is involved.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me break that name down. There's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, and then attached to a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). So, the structure must have a cyclohexyl group, a CH(OH)-, and then a CHO group all connected in some way.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The structure of that would be a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond attached, like cyclohexane-C≡CH. So, maybe the triple bond is where the action happens.

I think I need to figure out the steps to go from that to the target. Let's think about possible reactions. Triple bonds can undergo various additions. For example, maybe we can do a hydration. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane—so, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH2 group? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

First, what reactions can happen with a terminal alkyne like that? One possibility is deprotonation to form a strong base. Oh, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate terminal alkynes. So, if we use NaNH2 and methyl chloride, maybe a methyl group is added. Wait, methyl chloride is CH3Cl. So, if we deprotonate the alkyne, we get a cyclohexylacetylide ion. Then, CH3Cl could act as an alkylating agent. So, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, adding a methyl group.

Wait, but wait. If we have ethynylcyclohexane, deprotonating with NaNH2 would give the acetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride would give a methyl group. So, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, the acetylide is the sp hybridized carbon. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. Deprotonating gives cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would provide a methyl group, so it would add to the acetylide. So, the product would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3? Wait, no, wait. The acetylide is on the end, so adding a methyl would give CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation followed by alkylation. So, after deprotonation with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, the product would be cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Ethyxl group is -C≡CH. Deprotonating gives the acetylide: cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react with that. The acetylide is a strong nucleophile, so it would attack CH3Cl, leading to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, the product after the first step would have a propyl group attached? Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. Deprotonation gives cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻. Alkylation with CH3Cl would add a methyl group to the acetylide, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, that would be a propyne, perhaps. But I'm not entirely sure.

The next step in the options varies. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: After NaNH2 and methyl chloride, step 2 is H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. Then Ba(OH)2, and then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Hmm, that sounds like a oxidation and maybe some kind of elimination.

Option B: After NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, step 2 is Li and liquid NH3. That sounds like a Birch reduction or maybe some kind of deprotonation. Then O3 and H2O, then NH4OH. Ozone is for ozonolysis.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride, then H2/Pd with CaCO3, then O3 with (CH3)2S, then Ba(OH)2. Ozone is again a possibility, and (CH3)2S is a reductive workup for ozonolysis.

Option D: Uses NaNH2 and methanol. Then Li and liquid NH3, O3 with (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

Hmm. Let me try to work through the problem step by step.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. The substituent is cyclohexyl (from the cyclohexane) attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is then attached to a carbonyl group (CHO). So, the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl-CHO.

Wait, wait, the substituent is cyclohexyl attached to a CH(OH)- which is then attached to a CHO group. So, the structure would be cyclohexane with a substituent that is -(cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2-CHO.

So, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2CHO group. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternative approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring, and at position 1, there's a group that's a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So, it's like (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) attached to a cyclohexane, which also has an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to a CH2CHO group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl group (CHO) all attached to the same carbon on the cyclohexane. So, the structure would be something like:

cyclohexane ring with a substituent at C1: CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO.

Wait, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching point. So, the substituent is a CH2 group that has a cyclohexyl, an OH, and a CHO group attached. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, perhaps it's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, no, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part means the cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached. The substituent at position 1 is a hydroxymethyl group that's also attached to a cyclohexyl group.

So, the structure is cyclohexane with a CHO group at position 1, and a substituent that is a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group at position 1. Wait, that can't be because position 1 can't have two substituents. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group where one of the Hs is replaced by a cyclohexyl and another H replaced by an OH, and the CH2 is connected to the CHO.

Wait, maybe it's a branching point like this: The cyclohexane ring has a CH2 group attached at position 1. That CH2 has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a formyl group (CHO). So, the substituent would be CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO.

Wait, but that would require the CH2 group to have three substituents, which is possible. So, the substituent is a CH group that has a cyclohexyl, OH, and CHO attached. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a chain where the substituent is a -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane, and that group is also attached to a formyl group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a side chain that is a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH(OH) group to another CH2CHO group. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is connected to a CH2CHO group, all on the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the structure is as follows: the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1 which is a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group, an OH group, and a CHO group. But that's three substituents on a single carbon, which is possible, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2CHO group. So, the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)-CH(OH)-CH2-CHO attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps required to form this structure from ethynylcyclohexane.

Ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to a -C≡CH group.

So, the starting material is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached as -C≡CH.

The target has a formyl group (CHO) attached. So perhaps oxidation of some sort.

Let me think about possible reactions.

First, the triple bond could be converted into a carbonyl group. One way to do that is via hydration. But under acidic conditions, a triple bond would typically add water to form a ketone.

Wait, but starting from an alkyne, like ethynylcyclohexane, if we add water with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration), that would give cyclohexylpropan-2-ol? No. Wait, wait. When you hydrate a terminal alkyne, like HC≡C-R, under acidic conditions, you get an enol which tautomerizes to a ketone. So, you would get R-CO-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you hydrate a terminal alkyne (like ethyne), you get an enol, which is an enol form, and then it tautomerizes to a ketone. So, for example, ethyne (HC≡CH) would become CH3COH, which is an enol, then tautomerizes to CH3CHO (acetaldehyde)? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no, actually, hydration of a terminal alkyne typically gives a ketone. For example, HC≡C-R would become R-CO-CH3. So, in our case, R is cyclohexyl. So, the product would be cyclohexyl-CO-CH3, right?

But wait, the target has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane. So, maybe that's part of the structure. Alternatively, perhaps we can add groups step by step.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So, step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That would deprotonate the alkyne, giving an acetylide, then methyl chloride would alkylate it to give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 (a propyne). Then step 2 is hydrogenation with H2 and Pd. That would hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. If it's propyne (C≡C), hydrogenation would add two Hs to each C. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, and the substituents would be CH3 and CH2-cyclohexane.

Wait, wait. The initial alkyne is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. After alkylation with CH3Cl, we get cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So, the product would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, that seems like a propane chain attached to cyclohexane. But the target has a formyl group. So, this might not be the right path.

Then, step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which are conditions for hydration (like in the oxymercuration reaction). But I'm not sure how that would fit into the target molecule.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li and liquid NH3; then O3, H2O; then NH4OH.

NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would deprotonate the alkyne and add ethyl group, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, Li and liquid NH3 is a Birch reduction, maybe for reducing aromatic rings, but perhaps in this context, it's for deprotonating something else. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is used for elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. Then, ozonolysis would break double bonds. So, if we had a diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure how this fits.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, CH3Cl; then H2/Pd with CaCO3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

So, after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2 with Pd and CaCO3 is hydrogenation, so the triple bond becomes a single bond, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozone is for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But after hydrogenation, the triple is a single bond. So, maybe this is not applicable. Alternatively, perhaps the product has a double bond which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, maybe after step 2, there's a double bond. Wait, no. H2 and Pd reduce triple bonds to single bonds, not double bonds. So, maybe step 3 is irrelevant unless another reaction forms a double bond.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li and liquid NH3; then O3 with (CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

Deprotonating with NaNH2 and methanol would perhaps add a methyl group? Or maybe it's an alkylation with CH3OH, but that's more of an aldehyde or ketone scenario. Wait, methanol is CH3OH. So, maybe the acetylide would react with methanol to form CH3-O- attached. But that would make an ether. I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group to the triple bond, turning it into a propyne. Then, perhaps hydrogenate to a cis-alkane. Then, perhaps ozonolysis is used to break a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the target molecule has a formyl group, which is a CHO group. So, maybe ozonolysis is used to form that.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall plan is to add substituents to the triple bond, then hydrogenate, then perform some kind of oxidation or cleavage.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to a CH2CHO group. So, perhaps the process is:

1. Add a methyl group to the ethynyl group to create a propyne.
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, but wait, Pd would add hydrogen and reduce triple bonds to single bonds. Alternatively, perhaps a different catalyst is used to hydrogenate to a cis or trans double bond.
Wait, but in the options, step 2 in option A is H2/Pd, which would reduce the triple bond to a single bond.

Wait, maybe I should consider what each reagent does.

In option C, step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, so ozonolysis followed by reductive workup would give aldehydes or ketones, depending on the starting alkene.

Wait, perhaps the plan is:

- Convert the alkyne into a substituted alkyne.

- Reduce the alkyne to an alkene.

- Then, oxidize the alkene into a diol or something else, but that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps after reducing the alkyne to an alkene, perform ozonolysis to cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think again about the target. It's a cyclohexane with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CH2CHO group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the reagents again.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. That would deprotonate the alkyne, making the acetylide. Methanol (CH3OH) would then react with the acetylide. But how? Typically, alkylation is with an alkyl halide, not an alcohol. So, unless it's a substitution, but maybe under basic conditions, the acetylide could substitute with the CH3O⁻ group? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkyne alkylation with methanol, but I don't think that's standard. Maybe that's a wrong approach.

Option B: Step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, so that adds an ethyl group to the alkyne. Then, step 2 is Li and liquid NH3. Li in liquid NH3 is for Birch reductions, which is typically for aromatic rings, but perhaps it's used here for deprotonation or elimination. Then, ozonolysis, which would break a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but where would the double bond come from? Because after step 1, we have a propyne (ethyl group added to the alkyne). Then, step 2: perhaps Li in NH3 is used to deprotonate and form an alkyne with a lithium reagent, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction of the alkyne to an alkane, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl group all attached to the same carbon on the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2CHO group attached to the cyclohexane.

So, the plan is:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne (step 1: NaNH2 and CH3Cl) → propyne.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond → gives a propane chain.

3. Then, perhaps oxidize the end to form a formyl group.

Wait, for oxidation, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in some way. Or maybe an ozonolysis step to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding the methyl group, the next step is to perform a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, then ozonolysis to cleave it.

Wait, let me try to outline a possible synthetic pathway.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane:

1. Deprotonate with NaNH2 to form the acetylide ion.

2. Alkylate with CH3Cl to form cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 (propyne).

3. Reduce the triple bond to a cis double bond using H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's (but the options use H2/Pd, which would fully hydrogenate to single bond, not cis). So, if we use H2 and Pd, the triple becomes a single bond.

So, after step 2, the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 (which is a propane chain attached to the cyclohexane). But that doesn't seem to help with forming the aldehyde or the hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the acetylide is treated with a different reagent. Let me think about oxidation.

Another thought: Maybe after adding the methyl group, we perform an elimination to form a double bond, which can then be oxidized or ozonolyzed.

Wait, but in the options, after the alkylation, the next steps involve hydrogenation, then something else.

Wait, looking at option C:

Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. So, after step 2, which is H2/Pd, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond. Then, O3 would require a double bond. So, perhaps in step 2, the triple is converted to a double bond.

Wait, but H2 and Pd would add two hydrogens and reduce triple to single. So, unless another step is involved.

Wait, perhaps after alkylating, step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else. For example, if the next step is dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. But in the options, step 2 is H2/Pd, which suggests hydrogenation.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the proper sequence is:

1. Alkyne to alkyne with methyl group: NaNH2 and CH3Cl → propyne.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst. But the option uses Pd, which would fully hydrogenate to single bond. So perhaps that's not the case.

Another approach: Maybe the initial alkyne is converted into a secondary alcohol, which can then be oxidized to a ketone, but that's not matching the target structure.

Wait, another possibility: The target has a formyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol.

So, the steps could be:

- Add a methyl group to the triple bond.

- Reduce the triple bond to a secondary alcohol.

- Then, perform some reaction to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. Hydration of the alkyne would give a ketone. Then, perhaps further reactions.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which would upon hydration give cyclohexylacetone (cyclohexyl-CO-CH3). Then, perhaps further reactions on this ketone.

But the target has a formyl group, which is more like a primary carbonyl. So, perhaps the ketone is then transformed into an aldehyde. But that's tricky because reducing a ketone would give an alcohol, not an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps a Grignard reaction is involved, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the plan is:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne (NaNH2 and CH3Cl → propyne).

2. Reduce the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond (maybe using H2 and a catalyst like Pt or Lindlar's).

3. Perform ozonolysis on the resulting alkene to cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

But the target has only one formyl group, so perhaps only one of the two carbonyls is needed.

Alternatively, maybe the alkene is then oxidized to form a diol, which can be cleaved further.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should think about each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, CH3Cl; H2/Pd; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Wait, after step 1: propyne (cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3).

Step 2: H2/Pd → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, a single bond, no double bond.

Step 3: O3 would require a double bond. But in this case, the molecule has a single bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So, this option doesn't make sense.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/liquid NH3; O3, H2O; NH4OH.

After step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3 (Ethynylcyclohexane becomes propargyl ethyl cyclohexane?).

Step 2: Li in NH3. Birch reduction? Or perhaps deprotonation to form a metal acetylide, then adding another group? Or maybe elimination to form a diene.

But I'm not certain. Then, O3 would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps after step 2, the propynyl group is converted into an alkene. But I'm not sure.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liquid NH3; O3, (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: Acetylide reacts with methanol. Not sure about this step. Maybe it's an alkylation, but methanol is an alcohol. Alternatively, could it be adding a hydroxyl group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The target has both a cyclohexyl group and an aldehyde group attached. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol.

Which of the options include oxidation steps that could form an aldehyde?

Looking at the options:

Option A includes H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the typical conditions for oxymercuration. Oxymercuration would add an OH group in a Markovnikov fashion, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Option C has (CH3)2S after O3, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes or ketones.

Option D has NH4OH after ozonolysis, which is a reductive workup as well.

So, perhaps the correct sequence involves ozonolysis to form the aldehyde.

Wait, let's consider the steps:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne (NaNH2, CH3Cl → propyne).

2. Reduce the propyne to cis or trans propene. Wait, but with H2 and Pd, it would be fully hydrogenated to propane, which is a single bond. So, without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't work.

Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the initial reduction doesn't go to completion, but I think that's unlikely. So, perhaps the correct option is different.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, then a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is:

- Add a methyl group to the triple bond.

- Hydrogenate to a double bond (but with H2 and Lindlar's catalyst, not Pd?).

- Ozonolysis to break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

- Then, work up to form aldehydes.

But in the options, step 2 is either H2/Pd or other steps.

Wait, let's try to evaluate option D:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: So, deprotonate the alkyne to form acetylide, then react with methanol. Maybe the acetylide attacks methanol, but that would form an ether, which doesn't fit the target.

But the target has a hydroxymethyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol in a different way. Maybe a substitution, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is forming a ketone via hydration, but that's not what NaNH2 would do.

Step 2 in option D is Li and liquid NH3, which could be a Birch reduction. But for Birch, you need an aromatic ring. The starting material doesn't have that. So, maybe it's used for something else, like deprotonating an alcohol to form a lithium species.

Not sure.

Option C:

After step 1: propyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

No double bond, so ozonolysis in step 3 won't do anything. So, this option is unlikely.

Option B:

After step 1: propyne with ethyl group, so longer chain.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3. Perhaps deprotonation to form a lithium acetylide, then quench to form a longer chain. But not sure.

Step 3: O3, H2O: Ozonolysis would break a double bond into two carbonyls. But where would the double bond come from? Unless step 2 forms a double bond via elimination. So, maybe step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation. But I don't see where the halide would come from.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the target again. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl and a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne → propyne.

2. Reduce the triple bond to a double bond (using H2 and a catalyst that stops at the double bond, like Lindlar's).

3. Ozonolyze the double bond to form a carbonyl group. For example, ozonolysis of 1,2-disubstituted alkene would give two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I don't see any option with Lindlar's catalyst. All options use H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate to single bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne to alkyne with methyl group.

2. Reduce to double bond using a different catalyst.

But none of the options have that.

Hmm... Maybe I should look for the presence of a formyl group. The formyl group (CHO) is usually formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol or via ozonolysis of an alkene.

So, if an ozonolysis step is present, it could form the aldehyde.

Looking at the options, options B, C, D have ozonolysis steps.

In option C, after H2/Pd, the molecule is a single bond, so ozonolysis won't work. So, maybe option B or D.

Option B: After step 2 (Li and NH3), perhaps a double bond is formed. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyls.

So, let's think:

Step 1: Add ethyl group → propyne.

Step 2: Li and NH3 → maybe elimination to form a triple bond again? Or perhaps a different reaction. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is used for the Birch reduction, which would add electrons to the molecule, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a deprotonation to form a stronger base, which then eliminates to form a double bond.

For example, if after adding an ethyl group, the molecule is CH2CH2CH3 attached to the cyclohexane, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation. But without a halide, that wouldn't work. So, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, CH3Cl → propyne.

2. H2/Pd → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → no double bond, so no cleavage. So, no aldehyde formed. Hence, this option is not correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correct option is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another angle: the target has a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)). So, perhaps the reagent Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation or elimination.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination reactions, perhaps forming an alkene from an alcohol. Or, in presence of an alcohol, it could lead to epoxide formation, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 in H2SO4 and HgSO4, H2O (option A's step 4) sounds
