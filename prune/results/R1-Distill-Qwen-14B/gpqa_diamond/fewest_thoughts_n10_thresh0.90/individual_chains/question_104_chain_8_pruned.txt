Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect that as shifts in the spectral lines.

The problem says there are two stars with the same masses as each other, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So the main differences are the Doppler shifts observed: Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So I need to find the ratio P2/P1.

I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the planet's velocity. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the star's motion. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 AU)^{1/3} * year^{-1} ) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for the Doppler shift. The amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (P/(2π))^(1/3), but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3). But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is like 17 Earth masses, Sun is much bigger), so M_p/M_star is negligible, so we can approximate it as K ≈ (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) * something else... Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / (P * c) )^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital motion. The formula is:

K = ( (G * P )/( 2 * π * c^3 )) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Wait, perhaps an alternative way is to relate the velocities. The star's velocity K is related to the planet's velocity. So since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So K = (M_p / M_star) * V_p, where V_p is the planet's orbital speed.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( ( 2π ) / ( P * c ) )^(1/3 )

But perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, the formula I've heard is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p/M_star) * (P/(2π))^(1/3). But I'm not confident. Maybe I should look for a more direct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is approximately equal to v/c, where v is the velocity along the line of sight. So, the shift is inversely proportional to the wavelength. So if the shift is bigger, the velocity is higher.
