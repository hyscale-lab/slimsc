Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down what's given and what each step does.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (dihalides adjacent to each other) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically leading to an alkene. So, here, the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH would likely cause an E2 elimination, producing an alkene. The product mentioned is a light yellow solid, product 1.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum of product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone. Wait, but if it's an elimination, shouldn't it form an alkene? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Oh, wait, wait! KOH in this context might not just cause elimination. Oh! Wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a bridged bicyclic compound, heating with KOH could lead to a ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a carbonyl group. Wait, another thought: maybe it's not elimination but instead a substitution. Oh, but KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the product isn't just an alkene but something else. Oh! Wait, when vicinal dihalides react with a strong base, sometimes they can form epoxides under certain conditions, but that's usually with peracids or other conditions. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Wait, but how? Let me think.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged bicyclic compound. If KOH is used, perhaps the bromides are in a position where elimination leads to ring strain relief. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution, but that would require a good leaving group and perhaps some specific conditions. But KOH is a base, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. Because when dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes the base can abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination and formation of a double bond, but maybe in this case, the structure leads to a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl peak. Maybe the initial step isn't elimination but something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. So product 1 must have a carbonyl. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution leading to a carbonyl. Wait, could it be that each bromide is replaced by an OH group? No, because then we would have diol, and the IR would show O-H stretches, not a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, where each Br is replaced by an oxygen atom, but that doesn't make sense in this context. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a Hofmann elimination or something else, but that doesn't directly lead to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent bridgeheads. Heating with KOH would likely cause the two bromides to eliminate, leading to a structure with a double bond. But wait, if the molecule is symmetric, maybe it forms a ketone instead.

Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates a beta hydrogen, and the Br leaves, leading to an alkene. Then, the IR doesn't show a carbonyl. But the given IR shows a peak at 1720, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Maybe product 1 is the result of a substitution reaction. For example, each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would give a diol. But the IR doesn't show broad O-H stretches, which I would expect from a diol. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where OH is formed from each Br, but then the IR would have a peak around 3300 cm^-1 for O-H. The given IR peak is at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and heating with KOH leads to the formation of a ketone. How? Perhaps via oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the elimination forms a bicyclic ketone. For example, the elimination of two HBr molecules from adjacent carbons could lead to a carbonyl group. Wait, but how? If two adjacent Brs are eliminated, each would take a beta hydrogen, leading to a double bond. Unless the structure allows for a conjugated system that upon elimination leads to a carbonyl. Or maybe it's a case where the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl via the elimination of HBr twice.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. So, considering that, let me think about how that could happen. Oh! Maybe the base causes the elimination of HBr twice, and the resulting structure is a ketone. Wait, how?

Think about 1,3-dibromocyclohexane. If you eliminate two HBr molecules, you would form cyclohexa-1,3-diene. But that's not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a bridged bicyclic system with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has Br atoms on bridgehead positions, and elimination leads to a structure where a bridge is broken, forming a carbonyl. I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanedione or something similar.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or an ester. But the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so it's more likely a ketone or an ester.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. For instance, if two adjacent carbonyl groups are formed by eliminating HBr. So, the structure would have two ketone groups. But looking at the NMR, the 4.79 ppm peak is for 2H. That's a singlet, probably a methylene group (CH2) that's deshielded, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, but if it's a ketone, then the neighboring groups would be CH2.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused. The 1 and 3 positions are bridgehead positions. So, when KOH is added, perhaps the two Br atoms are eliminated as HBr, forming a double bond. But the product has a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a case of a conjugated diene but the IR suggests carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via an elimination-addition mechanism. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably an -OCH2O- group, such as in an epoxide. Wait, no, because epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm as a triplet. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like in a diol or an ether.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane. But then, the NMR would show peaks for the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls. Let me think. Adamantane has multiple equivalent CH2 groups, but in a di-ketone, the adjacent CH2 would be deshielded and show up around 2.4-2.2 ppm, perhaps as a multiplet.

Wait, the NMR given for product 1 is:

4.79 (2H), which is a triplet? Or a singlet? The question says 4.79 (2H), so the integration is 2H. The multiplicity isn't specified, but perhaps it's a singlet.

Then 2.41-2.23 (10H) – that's a lot of protons, perhaps from the CH2 groups in the adamantane structure.

1.94 (2H) – maybe another CH2 group.

So, combining all this, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. How?

Wait, when KOH is added and the product has a carbonyl, maybe each Br is replaced by a ketone group. But that would require each Br to be substituted by O, which would need some kind of oxidation, but KOH is a base.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide. No, the IR doesn't show the typical epoxide C-O-C peak around 1200 cm^-1. The IR here is at 1720, which is more like a ketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction forms a geminal diol, but that's if each Br is replaced by OH, but that would need more than just elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH isn't just doing elimination but also some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone because the reaction forms a carbonyl via some mechanism. I'm not entirely getting it, but perhaps I should move forward with the assumption that product 1 is a diketone.

So, moving on. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid and is commonly used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 has a ketone group. So perhaps product 2 is formed via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but wait, product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's acting as an acylating agent. Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. No, because the IR shows a carbonyl. Maybe product 1 is a diketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, no, because the IR would show a peak around 1200-1250 cm^-1 for the C-O-C bond. The given IR is at 1720, which is more like a ketone carbonyl.

Assuming product 1 is a diketone, heating with aluminum isopropoxide would perhaps lead to some kind of acylation. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but then the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the IR's 1720 cm^-1 isn't a carbonyl. Could that be something else? 1720 is a strong carbonyl, but maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but that's typically higher than 1700.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the initial reaction is not elimination but something else. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane plus KOH at high temperature. Oh! It could be a nucleophilic substitution, but with KOH as a base, more likely elimination. But wait, in a bridged bicyclic system, elimination could lead to a different structure.

Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic ether. But that would require the formation of an oxygen bridge, which would happen via an SN2 mechanism, but in a bridged system, that's unlikely because of steric hindrance. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination forming a double bond.

Let me think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an epoxide, but in that case, the protons are usually around 3-4 ppm and split into a triplet. Wait, but if it's a di-substituted epoxide, the protons could be a quartet or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 is an OCH2O group, like in an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the initial product is an alkene, and the IR's 1720 cm^-1 is from some other part, but I'm not seeing how. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about the initial reaction. Maybe it's not elimination. Maybe, considering the structure, heating with KOH could lead to a ring-opening, forming a diol. But then the IR would show O-H, which isn't specified here. The NMR doesn't show broad peaks, so maybe it's an ether or something else.

I think I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let's try to proceed and see if later steps can help.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Friedel-Crafts catalysts are used for alkylation or acylation of aromatic rings, but product 1 doesn't seem to have an aromatic ring. Wait, unless product 1 has a carbonyl group that can act as an acylating agent. If product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is formed via some kind of acylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is the result of ring-opening. But I'm not certain.

Next step: ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. When ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive work-up, it would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 is formed.

So, if product 3 is formed after ozonolysis, product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 1 must have undergone a reaction that forms a double bond when heated with aluminum isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of conjugated diene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, which upon heating with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3 undergoes ring-opening to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (IR: 1720 cm^-1, NMR shows CH2O or similar).

2. product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2.

3. product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3.

So, product 3 has an NMR where the most deshielded hydrogen has a certain coupling pattern.

Now, considering ozonolysis: if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. The coupling pattern in product 3's NMR would depend on the structure of product 2.

But wait, the problem is about the most deshielded hydrogen. Typically, deshielded protons are near electronegative atoms or in an environment with high electron withdrawal, like near carbonyl groups.

So, in product 3, after ozonolysis, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Let me try to outline possible structures:

1. Initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (maybe a diol or a diketone).

2. Product 1 treated with Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2 (maybe a diene or some structure with a double bond).

3. Ozonolysis of product 2 → product 3 (which would have carbonyl groups).

But perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an enol ether (if it undergoes elimination to form an ether with a double bond). Alternatively, product 1 might be a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (a compound with a conjugated carbonyl and double bond).

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it forms an ether via elimination, forming a double bond. For example, two diol groups eliminating to form an ether with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it forms an acetal or ketal, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is a conjugated diene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the diene into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think about ozonolysis of a diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would give two carbonyl groups. For example, 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehydes upon ozonolysis.

But in adamantane, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups.

But how does this tie back to the NMR of product 3, particularly the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen?

Wait, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be near a carbonyl group, perhaps as a CH2 or CH group adjacent to it.

In ozonolysis, each end of the double bond would form a carbonyl. So, if the double bond in product 2 was symmetric, then product 3 would have equivalent carbonyl groups, and the adjacent hydrogens would have certain coupling patterns.

Wait, the question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent (like -OH groups). So, in product 3, the hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl would be deshielded and would have neighboring hydrogens that split their signals.

For example, if the structure is (CH2) near a carbonyl, the coupling would depend on adjacent hydrogens. Suppose the structure is something like CH2-CO. The CH2 protons would couple with each other (geminal coupling, but that's usually not observed) and with adjacent groups.

Wait, another example: if the ozonolysis produces a diketone, then the adjacent CH2 groups would each have two neighboring hydrogens, leading to a triplet. Because each H is next to two others (like in a CH2CH2 group), but in reality, the coupling would depend on the exact structure.

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis produces a structure where each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, then each CH2 would have two Hs, and each H would be next to another CH2 group, leading to triplet coupling.

Wait, let's think about a simple case: ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene. The product would be two formaldehyde molecules, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if the diene is part of a cyclic structure, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls connected by a chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks a bridge in adamantane, leading to smaller rings with carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a substituted cyclopropane or another strained ring with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a tricyclic compound with a double bond, and ozonolysis would yield a diketone.

But the key is to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

Wait, another approach: Looking at the options, the possible coupling patterns are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, the most deshielded H is likely part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl group. The neighboring groups would influence the splitting.

If the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would have coupling with two Hs on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, usually not observed) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (vicinal coupling). But geminal coupling is typically not seen in 1H NMR because the J is very small and often not resolved. So, the splitting would be due to the adjacent group.

Wait, for example, if the CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each H would see two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would split into a triplet (n+1, where n=2). So, the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the CH2 is next to a CH group, then each H would see one neighboring H, leading to a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups. For example:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-R

In that case, each CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2. So, the middle CH2 would have neighboring groups on both sides. Each H in the middle CH2 would be next to two Hs on each side, leading to a septet (n=6, which is a heptet, but that's not one of the options). Alternatively, the coupling is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each H on the CH2 is coupled to two Hs on one side and two on the other, but that would lead to a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, if the H is on a CH2 group that is next to another CH2 group, each H in the first CH2 would couple with two Hs in the adjacent CH2. So, each H would split into a triplet. But if the adjacent group is itself split by another coupling, it could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 that is adjacent to another CH2 which is next to another CH2. So, the first CH2's Hs would couple with the next CH2's Hs (n=2, triplet), and those next Hs are themselves coupled with another CH2 (n=2 again). So, the first H would be a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, considering that in the ozonolysis product, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, and these CH2 groups are adjacent to each other, the coupling could be a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like (CH2)2(CO)R. So, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. The Hs on each CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet.

If the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to another CH2, the coupling would be a triplet. So, the answer would be option A.

But wait, another possibility: If the H is on a CH group adjacent to a CH2, then the coupling would be a doublet of triplets or something else. For example, if the H is on a CH2 next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2, the coupling could be more complex.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps going back to the initial steps would help.

Let me try to summarize:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (which has a carbonyl, probably a diketone) → NMR shows a CH2O group.

2. Product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2 (which has a double bond, perhaps from elimination).

3. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis → product 3 (which has carbonyl groups).

In product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl. Assuming it's part of a CH2 group, and that CH2 is next to another CH2, the coupling would be a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure leads to a more complex splitting, such as a triplet of triplets.

But the options don't include a triplet of triplets as the first choice; option B is triplet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: The CH2 group is adjacent to two different sets of Hs, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe the H is coupled with two different neighboring groups. For example, if each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and two from another, the splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe the H is on a CH2 that is next to a CH group, which is next to another CH2. So, the CH2 H would couple with the CH group (n=1 → doublet) and then the CH would couple with another CH2 (n=2 → triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, the H could be part of a CH2 group that is between two other CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be certain. Given the options, I think the most probable coupling pattern is a triplet, so option A. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, but considering that ozonolysis would cleave a double bond into two carbonyls, each end would have a carbonyl group. So, if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyl groups at each end. The Hs adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

Assuming the Hs are on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each H would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Thus, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, option A.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely leads to elimination, forming a product with a carbonyl group (as indicated by the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹). The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the formation of a diketone or a related structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**: The product from the first step is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely introduces a double bond, forming product 2. The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined but is inferred to contain a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step targets double bonds.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield nearby hydrogens.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CH₂ group is likely flanked by other CH₂ groups, leading to coupling with two hydrogens on each adjacent CH₂. This results in a triplet coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A
