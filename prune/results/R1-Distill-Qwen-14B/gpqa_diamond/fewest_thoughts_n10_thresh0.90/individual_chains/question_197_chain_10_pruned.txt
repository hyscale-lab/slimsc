Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. 

First, let me look at the IR data. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. Since we don't have any nitrogen info, it's probably an O-H group. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be C=C aromatic ring vibrations, which suggests that the compound has an aromatic ring.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Broad usually means exchange with protons, like an -OH group in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm and might be a triplet if coupled, but this is a singlet. So maybe a carboxylic acid OH.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents in a para position. The integration is 2H each, so it's a para-substituted benzene. The 8.0 ppm is more deshielded, so maybe a substituent that is electron-withdrawing attached to the ring, like a carbonyl, or perhaps an electron-donating group like an OMe. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone or carboxylic acid on the ring.

Then there are some lower field protons:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm. Could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a branched structure. Maybe a CH between two carbons, like in an isopropyl group or a secondary alcohol.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, this time for two protons. Maybe adjacent to a CH group, perhaps part of a -CH2-CH2- structure or something like that.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for 3H. A doublet often signifies coupling with one proton. A methyl group attached to another CH. Like in a -CH(CH3)- group. So perhaps a geminal substituent.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain, maybe attached to something else. So, like a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the compound is a substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (from the OH at 10.5 ppm and the carbonyl at 1720 cm-1). So, the benzene would have a substituent with a carbonyl group attached. 

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm could also be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm and can be split into a triplet due to coupling with adjacent protons. In this case, it's a singlet, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So the structure might be something like benzene with a COOH group and some substituents.

Wait, but the aromatic protons are two doublets each integrating to 2H. So if the ring is para-substituted, maybe the substituent is a group like -COOH. Let me think about the NMR. The aromatic protons in para substitution would be two doublets. For example, if the substituent is -COOH at position 1, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be one set of doublets, and positions 3 and 5 another. But wait, in para substitution, the two protons adjacent to the substituent (ortho) would be deshielded, so higher ppm. So in this case, 8.0 ppm would be the ortho protons, and 7.2 the meta.

So the substituent is something that deshields the ortho protons more than the meta. A carbonyl group like COOH would do that. So the substituent is -COOH at position 4, perhaps, with another group attached as well?

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the aromatic signals are only two doublets, meaning two substituents in para positions? Or maybe the substituent is at the para position relative to another group. Wait, wait. No, wait. The benzene has two substituents? Or is the substituent itself more complex?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a chain. Like, the benzene has a group RCOOH. For example, the substituent could be a propionoic acid group or something similar.

Looking at the NMR again, the 10.5 ppm is the OH of the carboxylic acid. Then the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which suggest a para-substituted ring with an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

Now, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl, like a ketone. Or perhaps a CH group in a side chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a methylene (CH2) between two carbons. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH. So maybe a structure like CH(CH3)CH2... something.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a carbonyl. Let's think about the NMR. After the aromatic region, the most downfield protons are at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone. So maybe the substituent is a ketone attached to the benzene, but then where does the 1720 cm-1 come in? Because a ketone's carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, but this is at 1720, which might be a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but earlier I thought the 10.5 ppm OH is a carboxylic acid. So that would fit with a carbonyl at 1720 (carboxylic acid is around 1700, but maybe a bit higher if deprotonated? Or possibly an ester? Wait, no, esters are around 1740-1720 cm-1. So 1720 could be an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is a bit lower, around 1700. But maybe if it's conjugated or something else, it could be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak in 3400-2500, which would be O-H. For an ester, that's not present. So if the compound has an O-H, then it's either a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But the broad peak is around 10.5, which is more like a carboxylic acid. So the IR suggests a carboxylic acid.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and some substituent.

Looking at the NMR again, after the aromatic, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to the carbonyl. Let's think about the substituent being a side chain attached to the benzene. For example, a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propionoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), but that might not fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's something like a benzene ring with a -CH2-COOH group.

Wait, but let's think of the substituent as a longer chain. Let me try to reconstruct the structure.

The aromatic signals: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene. So perhaps two substituents in the para positions, like a substituent and a hydrogen. Wait, but perhaps it's a substituent that itself is at the para position relative to another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a chain with a carbonyl, like a benzene ring with a -CH2-CO-R group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a side chain that's more complex. Let's see the other NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m) is 1H. So perhaps a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m) is 2H, maybe a CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d) is 3H, a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t) is 3H, which is likely a terminal CH3 in an ethyl group.

So putting this together: a benzene ring, with a substituent that is a chain leading to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine the substituent is a -CH2-CO- group. But then where do the other protons come in?

Alternatively, let's think about a structure where the benzene is attached to a chain that ends with a carbonyl group, perhaps something like benzene-(CH2)n-COOH. Let's see.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider what the structure is before the reaction. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. That sounds like a reaction that would lead to the formation of an acid from an ester or a nitrile, but wait, no, more likely, it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine? No, wait, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to give amines. Alternatively, it's used for the elimination reaction. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a nitrile. No, because the IR has a carbonyl, which would be absent in a nitrile. Alternatively, the starting compound is an acid derivative, like an ester, which upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the question is about the product after the reaction. So first, I need to determine what the starting compound (Compound X) is, and then what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrile, but in that case, the initial compound would not have a carbonyl in IR, but the product would. Hmm.

Alternatively, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid. But if the starting material is an acid chloride, the IR would show a strong peak around 1800 cm-1 for the C=O, but in this case, it's 1720 cm-1, which is more in line with an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is typical for a carboxylic acid. So maybe the starting material is an ester, and after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, but wait, when an ester reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it would typically undergo acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. So perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the product is a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone, but then the IR would not have the OH. Alternatively, it's a nitrile, but then the OH wouldn't be present, and the IR would have a nitrile peak around 2200 cm-1, which is not present here.

So, perhaps Compound X is an ester. Let's think: the NMR would then have an ester group. But wait, the broad peak at 10.5 ppm would have to come from somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a propyl ester or similar.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzyl ester, but the NMR doesn't show ester protons (like OCOOR), but the ester methylene protons would be around 4 ppm or so, but in the given NMR, there are no peaks in that region.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to build the structure based on the NMR data.

The aromatic region indicates a para-substituted benzene. Let's imagine the substituent is at the para position, and perhaps it's a chain leading to a carbonyl group.

Let me try to think about each coupling and the integrations:

Aromatic:
- 8.0 ppm, d (2H): These are the two protons ortho to the substituent.
- 7.2 ppm, d (2H): These are the two protons meta to the substituent.

So substituent is at position 4 of the benzene ring.

The substituent itself: Let's see. The substituent has a carbonyl group (from IR) and a chain.

The substituent might be -CH2-CO-O-R, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like -CO-O-R, but that would be an ester. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would be -COOH.

Wait, if the substituent is -COOH, then the aromatic substituent is -COOH at position 4. But then where do the other protons come in? Because the NMR has other signals.

Wait, after the aromatic protons, there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which might be adjacent to a carbonyl. Maybe it's a CH connected to a carbonyl. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, let me try to imagine the substituent: maybe it's a benzene ring with a chain like -(CH2)n-COOH. For example, if the substituent is -(CH2)2-COOH, then the NMR would show the protons in the chain.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm: OH of COOH (broad singlet, 1H)
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH adjacent to the carbonyl. If the chain is -(CH2)2-COOH, then the CH2 before the COOH would have protons. Wait, but that's two CH2 groups. So if the substituent is -CH2-CH2-COOH, the protons on the CH2 near the COOH would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, perhaps. But the 2.9 ppm is a bit higher, so maybe it's a CH adjacent to a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2COOH)- something. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group with a side chain. Hmm.

Wait, let's look at the other NMR signals:

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Could be a CH2 group adjacent to a branch.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to a CH. Like in an isopropyl group: CH(CH3).

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal CH3, perhaps from an ethyl group.

So maybe the substituent is a chain with a branch. Let's see. For example, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2COOH group. Wait, let me think.

Wait, another approach: The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to a CH2. So perhaps it's part of an ethyl group, like CH2CH3.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H): So a CH3 attached to a CH. Like in an isopropyl group. So a structure like CH(CH3)â€“.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H): A CH group. So maybe the substituent is a chain like CH(CH3)â€“CH2â€“COOH attached to the benzene.

Putting it together, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2COOH. But wait, how does that fit the NMR data?

So benzene ring with a substituent at position 4: -(CH(CH3)CH2)COOH.

Wait, but then the structure would be benzene-4-yl-(CH(CH3)CH2)COOH.

But let's look at the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH next to the COOH. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the CH2 group attached to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is the methyl attached to the CH.

Yes, that seems to fit.

So the substituent on the benzene is a -CH(CH3)CH2COOH group. So the structure would be 4-(2-(propan-2-yl)ethyl)benzoic acid? Hmm, not exactly. Let me see.

Wait, let me sketch it:

Benzene ring with substituent at position 4:

position 4: -CH(CH2CH2COOH)- ?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2COOH)CH2- group, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH group.

Wait, that would be:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

But then the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH between CH(CH3) and CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the CH2 attached to the COOH. The 1.4 (d,3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH. And the 0.9 (t,3H) would be a terminal CH3, but wait, in the substituent I'm considering, there's no terminal CH3. So perhaps that's not right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)COOH? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH(CH2CH2COOH)CH2CH3). No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2COOH)CH3 group. So the substituent would be a -CH(CH3)CH2COOH attached to the benzene.

Wait, but how does that fit the NMR?

The substituent would be:

Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So the protons would be:

The CH(CH3) would have a proton at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), because it's adjacent to a CH2 group and a methyl.

The CH2 between CH(CH3) and COOH would have protons at 1.7 ppm (m,2H), because it's adjacent to both the CH(CH3) and the COOH.

The methyl group attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which matches.

But where does the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) come in? Hmm, that's a terminal methyl. Wait, in this structure, I don't see a terminal methyl. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. For example, it could be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)COOH.

Wait, perhaps the substit
