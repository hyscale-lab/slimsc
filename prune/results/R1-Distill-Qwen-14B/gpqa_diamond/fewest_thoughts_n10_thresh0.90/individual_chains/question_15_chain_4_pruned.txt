Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says that researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both are already detected by the RV method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's is slightly evolved. But the mass of Planet_1's host is twice that of Planet_2's host.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the distance of the planet's orbit. Oh wait, wait... The transit probability formula I think is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the (a_planet / R_star) term, but maybe I'm mixing up the formulas.

Wait, no, the transit probability isn't just the area. The probability for a planet to transit its star is given by the formula (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a_p / (R_s * sqrt(1 - e^2))), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity term becomes 1, so that part is just a_p. Wait, no, wait, actually, I think it's more like the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a_p / R_s), but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe not. Let me think again.

Ah, I think the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability is given by (R_star / a_planet)^2 * (R_planet / R_star)^2. Wait, no, maybe it's (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_planet) divided by something else? Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me look up the formula. Oh wait, no, I can't; I need to think from what I remember. So the probability of a planet transiting is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a_p / (something)). Wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2
