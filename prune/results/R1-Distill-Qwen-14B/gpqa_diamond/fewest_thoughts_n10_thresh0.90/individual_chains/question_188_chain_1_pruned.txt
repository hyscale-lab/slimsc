Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, but the angles between them are the same and not 90 degrees. So, it's like a cube that's been squeezed or stretched equally in all directions, making all the edges the same length but with angles α, β, γ which are all equal here, at 30 degrees each.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—that's the distance between atoms along the lattice points, right? So in a cubic system, that would be the edge length 'a', but here it's a rhombohedral system, so I think the lattice parameter 'a' would be 10 Angstroms.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember that for cubic systems, there's a formula involving the Miller indices, but rhombohedral is a bit different because of the angles.

The formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by some factors involving the lattice parameters and the angles. Wait, I think the general formula is:

d_hkl = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) / a² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) / (a²) ) )

Wait, or is that for a general hexagonal or other systems? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think for a rhombohedral crystal, the formula might simplify because all the angles are equal, and h, k, l are the same in this case since the plane is (111).

So, the Miller indices here are h=1, k=1, l=1. Let me plug these into the formula.

First, I'll write the general formula for a rhombohedral system. I think it's:

d = 1 / sqrt( ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) / a² + (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ) / a² )

But since α = β =
