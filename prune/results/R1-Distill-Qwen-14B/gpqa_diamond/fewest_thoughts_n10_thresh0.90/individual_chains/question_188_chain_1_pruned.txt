Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and the angles α, β, γ all equal to 30 degrees. The plane in question is (111). I need to find the interplanar distance for this plane.

Wait, I think the formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by the structure factor, but for a simple cubic structure or something like that. Oh wait, no, that's for simple cubic systems. But this is a rhombohedral crystal, which is a special case where all the lattice parameters are equal and all angles are the same.

Right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a rhombohedron, so the unit cell has a = b = c, and angles α = β = γ. So the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal would be different from a cubic one because the angles come into play.

I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_hkl = (a)/(√(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)cosθ))), but wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so the formula simplifies. But for a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so maybe there's a specific formula we can use.

Alternatively, I remember that the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. For a general triclinic system, the formula is more complicated, but in the case of rhombohedral symmetry, perhaps there's a simplified version.

Wait, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be derived from the general crystallographic formula. The general formula for interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is:

d = [ (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 a^2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ) ]^(-1/2) * [ ... ] wait no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to remember the formula for a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal (a = b = c), and all the angles are equal (α=β=γ). So the formula for interplanar distance should be:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that makes sense because in a cubic system, cos α is zero (since angles are 90 degrees), so the formula simplifies to a divided by the square root of (h² +k² +l²). But in our case, the angles are 30 degrees each.

Wait, the (111) plane
