Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think that's Li-6 or something like that.

First, I need to figure out the rest mass of the nucleus. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass number is 6, but wait, wait, that can't be right because 3 protons and 3 neutrons make 6 nucleons, so the mass is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But wait, I remember that the actual mass is a bit less due to binding energy, but for calculation purposes, maybe they just use the sum of protons and neutrons.

Wait, no, the mass of a nucleus is a bit tricky. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = let me calculate that.

3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. So the rest mass m is 6.047823 u. But wait, I'm supposed to convert this into kilograms because energy is in GeV and I need to use the formula for relativistic energy.

Right, 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So m = 6.047823 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Let me compute that. 6 * 1.66e-27 is about 1e-26 kg, but let's compute it more accurately.

6.047823 * 1.66053906660e-27 = Let's approximate. 6 * 1.6605e-27 = 9.963e-27 kg. But 0.047823 * 1.6605e-27 is about 0.047823 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.0794e-27, so total m ≈ (9.963 + 0.0794) e-27 = 10.0424e-27 kg, which is 1.00424e-26 kg. Wait, wait, no, 6.047823 * 1.6605e-27 is actually 6 * 1.6605e-27 plus 0
