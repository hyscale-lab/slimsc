Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out the mass of nucleus X. Lithium usually has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's Li-6. The isotope is important because that's the mass we'll use.

I remember that the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus can be found on the periodic table. Let me see, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but I think it's more precise to look up the exact value, but I'll go with what I remember for now.

Next, I need to calculate the relativistic energy. The formula for the total energy of a particle is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, let me compute that.

So v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Oh wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Now I need to compute the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is m*c², where m is the mass of the nucleus. So m is 6.017 u. But I need to convert that into kilograms because the energy will be in joules, and then I can convert to GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6.017 u would be 6.017 * 1.66054e-27 kg. Let me calculate that.

6.017 * 1.66054e-27 = let's see.

6 * 1.66054 is about 9.9632e-27. 0.017 *1.66054 is about 0.028229e-27. So total is approximately 9.9632e-27 + 0.028229e-27 = around 9.9914e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, more accurately: 6.017 * 1.6605390666e-27.

Let me compute 6 * 1.660539e-27 = 9.963234e-27.

0.017 * 1.660539e-27 = 0.02822916e-27.

Adding them gives 9.963234 + 0.02822916 = 9.991463e-27 kg. So m ≈ 9.991463e-27 kg.

Then, the rest energy m*c² is calculated as m * (3e8 m/s)^2.

So m*c² = 9.991463e-27 kg * (9e16 m²/s²) = 9.991463e-27 * 9e16 = let's compute this.

9.991463e-27 * 9e16 = (9.991463 *9) * 1e-11.

9.991463 *9 is approximately 89.923167. So 89.923167e-11 J, which is 8.9923167e-10 J.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute 9e16 * 1e-27: 9e16 *1e-27 = 9e-11. So 9.991463e-27 *9e16 is (9.991463 *9) * 1e-11.

Yes, 9.991463 *9 = approx 89.923167, so 89.923167e-11 J, which is 8.9923167e-10 J. Wait, that seems small. Wait, no: 1e-27 *1e16 is 1e-11. So 9.991e-27 * 9e16 = (9.991 *9) * 1e-11. 

Wait, 9.991 *9 is 89.92, so 89.92e-11 J.

Now, to convert this to GeV. I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, which is 1.602e-10 J.

So, the rest energy is 89.92e-11 J. Let's compute how many GeV that is.

Divide 89.92e-11 J by 1.602e-10 J/GeV.

So (89.92e-11) / (1.602e-10) = (89.92 / 160.2) ≈ 0.561 GeV.

Wait, let me compute 89.92e-11 / 1.602e-10.

Which is the same as (89.92 / 160.2) * (e-11 / e-10) ) = (0.561) * 10 = 5.61 GeV. Wait, wait a second, because 89.92e-11 is 8.992e-10 J. And 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J, so dividing 8.992e-10 by 1.602e-10 gives approximately 5.61 GeV.

Wait, let me recalculate:

m*c² = 9.991463e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.991463e-27 * 9e16 = 8.9923167e-10 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 8.9923167e-10 J = 8.9923167e-10 / 1.602e-19 eV.

That's approximately 5.61e9 eV, which is 5.61 GeV.

So the rest energy is approximately 5.61 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m*c². Gamma is 3.5714, so E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.61 GeV.

Calculating that: 3.5714 *5.61.

Let me compute 3.5 *5.61 = 19.635. 0.0714 *5.61 is approximately 0.403. So total is about 20.038 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately:

3.5714 *5.61 = ?

3 *5.61 =16.83.

0.5714*5.61:

0.5 *5.61 =2.805.

0.0714*5.61≈ 0.402.

Total 2.805 +0.402= 3.207.

So 16.83 +3.207 = 20.037 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419

So our approximation is about 20.037, but the option C is 20.132. Hmm, maybe my approximation for gamma was a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Earlier, I approximated sqrt(0.0784) as 0.28, which is correct because (0.28)^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)) = 1/(sqrt(1-0.9216))=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So computing E=gamma * m*c². I had m*c^2 as approximately 5.61 GeV. Let's be more precise.

Wait, perhaps my initial mass computation was approximate. Let me get the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017273 u. Let me use that.

So m =6.017273 u.

So m in kg is 6.017273 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Let me compute that:

6 *1.6605390666e-27 = approx 9.963234e-27 kg.

0.017273 *1.6605390666e-27 = let's compute:

0.01 *1.660539e-27 =1.660539e-29.

0.007273 *1.660539e-27 is approximately 0.01208e-27.

Wait, 0.007273 *1.660539e-27.

Wait 0.007 is 0.007 *1.660539e-27=0.011623773e-27=1.1623773e-29.

0.000273 *1.660539e-27: 0.000273 is 2.73e-4. So 2.73e-4 *1.660539e-27 = approx 4.525e-31.

So total 1.6605e-29 (from 0.01) +1.1624e-29 +4.525e-31.

Adding 1.6605e-29 and 1.1624e-29 gives 2.8229e-29.

Adding 4.525e-31 is 2.8229e-29 +0.04525e-29 = approx 2.86815e-29.

So total m = 9.963234e-27 kg + 2.86815e-29 kg = 9.963234e-27 + 0.0286815e-27 = 9.9919155e-27 kg.

So m =9.9919155e-27 kg.

Now, m * c²:

c =3e8 m/s, so c²=9e16 m²/s².

So m*c² =9.9919155e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s² = 8.99272395e-10 J.

Convert to GeV:

1 eV =1.602176634e-19 J.

So 1 GeV =1e9 eV =1.602176634e-10 J.

So m*c² in GeV is (8.99272395e-10 J) / (1.602176634e-10 J/GeV) = 8.99272395 / 1.602176634 ≈ 5.612 GeV.

Wait, let me compute 8.99272395 divided by 1.602176634.

Hmm, 1.602176634 *5=8.01088317. 8.01088317 is less than 8.99272395.

Difference is 8.99272395 -8.01088317=0.98184078.

So 5.5 would be 1.602176634 *5.5= 8.811971487.

But 8.811971487 is less than 8.99272395.

Difference is 8.99272395-8.811971487=0.180752463.

0.180752463 /1.602176634 ≈ 0.1128.

So total is 5.5 +0.1128≈5.6128 GeV.

So m*c² is approximately 5.6128 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6128 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6128 = let's compute.

0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.0128 *3.57142857≈0.045714286.

So 2.14285714 +0.045714286≈2.18857143.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.18857143=20.04571428 GeV.

So approximately 20.0457 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the precise calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision. Let me compute gamma again.

v =0.96c, so beta=0.96.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1 / sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571.

So that's precise.

Wait, perhaps my m*c² calculation is a bit off. Let me recompute m*c² more accurately.

m =6.017273 u.

m in kg: 6.017273 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Compute 6 *1.6605390666e-27 =9.9632343996e-27.

0.017273 *1.6605390666e-27.

Compute 0.017273 *1.6605390666.

0.017273 *1.6605390666:

Compute 0.01 *1.6605390666 =0.016605390666.

0.007273 *1.6605390666:

=0.007 *1.6605390666 =0.0116237734662.

0.000273 *1.6605390666=0.00045253380666.

Add all three:

0.016605390666 +0.0116237734662 =0.0282291641322.

Add 0.00045253380666: 0.0282291641322 +0.00045253380666=0.02868169793886.

So 0.017273 *1.6605390666e-27 =0.02868169793886e-27=2.868169793886e-29 kg.

So m =9.9632343996e-27 +2.868169793886e-29 = 9.9632343996e-27 +0.02868169793886e-27 = (9.9632343996 +0.02868169793886) e-27.

Which is 9.9919160975e-27 kg.

Then, m*c² =9.9919160975e-27 kg *9e16 m²/s²= 8.99272448775e-10 J.

Convert to GeV:

8.99272448775e-10 J /1.602176634e-10 J/GeV =8.99272448775 /1.602176634 ≈5.6127 GeV.

So m*c² is approximately 5.6127 GeV.

Then E =gamma * m c^2 =3.57142857 *5.6127.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6127=?

3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0127=0.045396825.

So total 2.14285714 +0.045396825=2.18825396.

So E=17.85714285 +2.18825396=20.04539681 GeV.

Hmm, about 20.0454 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But wait, our calculation is 20.045 GeV. None of the options match exactly, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 isn't 6.017273 u. Let me double-check the exact mass. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact gamma and see.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the exact formula.

The energy E is gamma * m c².

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c² ) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.96²)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps using more precise computation of gamma.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 * m c².

Now, m is 6.017273 u.

Let me compute m c² in GeV more accurately.

m c² =6.017273 u * c².

1 u c² is approximately 931.5 MeV, which is 0.9315 GeV.

So 6.017273 *0.9315 = ?

Let me compute 6 *0.9315=5.589.

0.017273 *0.9315 = approx 0.01607.

So total is 5.589 +0.01607=5.60507 GeV.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me compute 6.017273 *0.9315.

Compute 6 *0.9315=5.589.

0.017273 *0.9315:

0.01 *0.9315=0.009315.

0.007273 *0.9315= approx 0.006784.

So total 0.009315 +0.006784=0.016099.

So 5.589 +0.016099=5.605099 GeV.

So m c²≈5.6051 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.6051.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6051.

3 *5.6051 =16.8153.

0.57142857 *5.6051.

0.5 *5.6051=2.80255.

0.07142857 *5.6051≈0.4023.

So 2.80255 +0.4023=3.20485.

So total E=16.8153 +3.20485=20.02015 GeV.

Approximately 20.020 GeV.

But the options are:

A)18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419

So 20.02 is not exactly matching any option. But the closest option is C)20.132.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01
