Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the fields involved.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, let me think. So in the SMEFT framework, operators are added that are consistent with the symmetries of the SM. The SM respects certain symmetries, so the SMEFT operators should also respect those same symmetries. But which are they exactly?

First, Lorentz symmetry. I know that the SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So any operator added in SMEFT must also be Lorentz-invariant. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

Then Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory has Poincare symmetry, it automatically includes Lorentz. But wait, SMEFT is built upon the SM, which is a Poincare-invariant theory. So the SMEFT operators must also respect Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Next, what about CP symmetry? The SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry; CP is an approximate symmetry, but it's not exact. For example, CP violation is present in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, would SMEFT operators have to respect it? No, because the SM itself doesn't. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, meaning that CP symmetry (3) doesn't have to be respected by all operators. So 3 is not necessarily required.

CPT symmetry, on the other hand, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. The SM is CPT-invariant, and I believe all effective theories must respect CPT symmetry because it's tied to unitarity and other deep principles. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (4).

So putting it together, which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait—wait. Do Poincare and Lorentz symmetries mean the same thing for the SMEFT operators?

Wait, the Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must be Poincare-invariant because that's part of the structure of quantum field theories. So yes, operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz.

So the operators must respect 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) symmetry. Wait, but the options are: 

Option C says 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. So in that case, which is correct?

Wait, so the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. The SM respects all of them. So SMEFT, being an extension, must also respect them. So yes, operators must be Poincare-invariant, Lorentz-invariant, and CPT-invariant. But wait, wait—does the SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM, which already respects Poincare. So any operator added must also make the total action Poincare-invariant. So yes, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare, so 2 is correct.

But wait... another angle: some effective theories can break some symmetries if the UV theory doesn't have them. But in the SM and SMEFT, we have Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT operators must respect it.

So the required symmetries are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. So Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) are both required. So the correct options are 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.

Wait, but wait—when you have the SMEFT, the Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. So all operators must be Poincare scalars. So yes, operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

So the correct answer includes 1,2,4. So option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model (SM), which must respect the symmetries of the SM. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Here's the analysis:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (1):** The SM is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for consistency with the SM framework.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (2):** Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a quantum field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry, as this is a foundational aspect of such theories. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry (3):** The SM does not respect CP symmetry exactly, as CP violation is observed (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry (4):** CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, closely tied to unitarity and other deep principles. The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT operators must also respect this symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is **C) 1, 2, 4**.

Answer: C
