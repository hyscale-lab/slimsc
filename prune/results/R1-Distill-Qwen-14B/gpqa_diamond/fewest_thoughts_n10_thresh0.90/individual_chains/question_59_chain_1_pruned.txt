Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and pH calculations can get tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with various pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out if the mixture is acidic, basic, or neutral. Let me think about what each of these solutions contributes.

First, let's list out the components:

1. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. It dissociates partially.
2. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely.
3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

Wait, but wait, Ba(OH)2 actually dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH^- per formula unit. So each mole gives two moles of hydroxide.

So, I think the approach here is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture, then see if there's an excess of acid or base. If they're equal, it's neutral. If not, the excess will determine the pH.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of each acid and base.
2. Find the total moles of H+ from the acids.
3. Find the total moles of OH- from the base.
4. Subtract moles of OH- from moles of H+ to see which is in excess.
5. If H+ is in excess, calculate concentration and pH. If OH- is in excess, calculate concentration and pOH, then pH.
6. Also, consider the total volume of the solution because concentration is moles/volume (L).

So, let's start with each solution.

First, calculate moles for each solution.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M, volume = 0.5 L (500 mL). Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 mol.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. But when mixing with strong acids and bases, maybe the strong acid will dominate? Hmm, not sure, but perhaps we can treat the total H+ as the sum of all H+ contributions, but need to account for whether the base neutralizes some of it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider all H+ sources and OH- sources and then find the net H+ or OH-.

Wait, but the strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will completely dissociate. So their contributions can be directly added to H+ and OH-.

The acetic acid, being weak, will not fully dissociate, but in the presence of a strong base, some of its H+ might be neutralized. Hmm, but the presence of excess OH- from the base will deprotonate the acetic acid as well. So perhaps we need to consider all possible neutralizations.

Wait, but let's approach this step by step.

First, let's calculate all the moles.

Moles of H+ from HCl:
HCl is strong acid, so each mole gives 1 mole H+.

Moles HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol HCl. So H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:
Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.
Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles OH^-.

Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L =
