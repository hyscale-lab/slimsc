Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read through it again and think it through step by step.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, okay, I remember that stars can have spots, like sunspots, which are cooler regions. When these spots cover part of the star's surface, they can affect the overall temperature measurements.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work exactly? I think when spots cover part of the surface, the star's total luminosity changes because spots are cooler. But the effective temperature is calculated based on the total luminosity and the surface area, right?

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, say level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so Boltzmann equation applies here.

The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the ratio without spots over the ratio with spots.

Alright, so the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, what's the transition wavelength? The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. The energy difference between the two levels can be calculated using the relation E = hc/λ. Let me jot that down.

So, E = hc/(lambda). The Planck constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength given is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. Let me compute E.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But I'll need this energy in terms of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38e-23 J/K). So let's compute E/(k*T) for both temperatures.

Wait, but the problem is that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So the effective temperature for the entire star is 5500 K when spots are present. But the spots themselves are cooler than that, right? Wait, no. The problem says that the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So perhaps the effective temperature for the unspotted regions is higher? Or maybe we can ignore that and just consider the average temperature.

Wait, but in LTE, the photosphere is at a certain temperature. If the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when spots are present, does that mean that the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K? Or is the photosphere at a different temperature?

Wait the problem says: "when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K in that case. So when calculating the ratio of Ti atoms, the temperature to use is the effective temperature of the photosphere, which is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not.

So for each case (with spots and without), we have a different temperature T. The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - delta_E/(k*T) ), where delta_E is E2 - E1. But since the problem gives the transition wavelength, delta_E is hc/(lambda).

Wait, but the energy E corresponds to the transition between the two levels, so E2 > E1, so delta_E = E2 - E1 = hc/
