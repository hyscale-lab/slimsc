Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but this one looks different.

Wait, wait. The given ρ is an average of |0><0| and |1><1|. Each of those is a projector, and when you average them, you're mixing them equally. So ρ would represent a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Because I think that when you have equal probabilities for both states, it's the maximally mixed state.

But the question is about its geometrical position. Geometrical in qubit space—maybe the Bloch sphere? I remember the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For pure states, the state is a point on the surface of the sphere. For mixed states, it's inside the sphere.

The Bloch vector (r) for a density matrix ρ is given by something like r = [x, y, z], right? The formula I recall is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix. Let me write that out. 

The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So when you take r·σ, it's r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. Then, (I + r·σ)/2 gives a 2x2 matrix. So if I have ρ, I can compare it to this expression to find r.

Let me compute each term. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write out the matrices for |0><0| and |1><1|. |0> is [1;0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. |1> is [0;1], so |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together: [[1,0],[0,1]]. So ρ is (1/2)*[[1,0],[0,1]], which is the same as the identity matrix divided by 2.

Wait, wait. Because I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So ρ is (I)/2. Now, according to the Bloch sphere formula, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set (I/2) equal to (I + r·σ)/2, I can solve for r·σ.

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ. So r·σ must be zero. That implies that each component of r is zero. Because σx, σy, σz are the Pauli matrices, which are all traceless and have non-zero elements.

If r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz = 0, then each coefficient must be zero. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). That corresponds to the completely mixed state. 

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), and option B is (0,0,1). Wait, wait. Wait, no—wait, wait. The maximally mixed state has r as (0,0,0) because it's the center of the Bloch sphere. Because for a pure state, like |0>, r is (0,0,1). So when the state is maximally mixed, it's in the center.

So the answer should be option C, which is (0,0,0). Let me just double-check the steps. 

We have ρ = (I)/2. So when we set (I + r·σ)/2 equal to (I)/2, we get I + r·σ = I. Which means r·σ = 0. So all components are zero, which leads to r=(0,0,0). Yep, that seems right.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this to the Bloch sphere formula, we find:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}.
\]

Multiplying through by 2 gives:

\[
I = I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}.
\]

Subtracting \( I \) from both sides, we find:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

This implies that all components of \( \mathbf{r} \) are zero, i.e., \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( (1,1,0) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.**

**B) \( (0,0,1) \): Incorrect, as this represents a pure state, not a mixed state.**

**C) \( (0,0,0) \): Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state.**

**D) \( (1,1,1) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.**

Answer: C
