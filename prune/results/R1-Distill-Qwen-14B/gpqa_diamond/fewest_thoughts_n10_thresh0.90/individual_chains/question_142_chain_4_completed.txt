Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it. The question gives a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are various points in a 3D space, like (1,1,0), (0,0,1), etc.

Wait, what's a density matrix again? Oh right, it's a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|), and mixed states are statistical ensembles of these.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, that looks familiar. So each term is |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, each multiplied by 1/2. So this is a mixture of the two basis states, each with equal probability. That would mean it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, qubit space is often visualized in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector representation comes into play here. For a single qubit density matrix, any state can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector). The length of r must be ≤ 1 because of the unitarity of quantum states.

Wait, let's break it down. The general form is (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2. So when I expand ρ, I can compare coefficients. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me express |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| in terms of Pauli matrices.

I remember that |0⟩⟨0| can be written as (I + |0⟩⟨0| - |1⟩⟨1| )/2? Or wait, actually, the identity matrix I is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). So for |0⟩⟨0|, that's (I + σ_z)/2. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is (I - σ_z)/2.

Wait, let me check that. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So, considering σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So (I + σz)/2 would be [[1,0],[0,1]]/2 + [[1,0],[0,-1]]/2. That equals [[1,0],[0,0]] which is |0⟩⟨0|. Oh right! So |0⟩⟨0| is (I + σz)/2 and |1⟩⟨1| is (I - σz)/2.

So the given ρ is 1/2 [ |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ] = 1/2 [ (I + σz)/2 + (I - σz)/2 ].

Let me compute that: (I + σz + I - σz)/4 * (1/2) ? Wait no, the given ρ is 1/2 multiplied by the sum. So, sum is |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|, which is equal to I. So then ρ is (1/2) * I. Oh, right! Because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

Comparing to the general form (I + r·σ)/2. So in this case, (I + r·σ)/2 equals (I)/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. So r·σ = 0. So what vector r satisfies r·σ = 0?

Well, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ = r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. For this to be zero matrix, each component must be zero. Because each Pauli matrix is non-zero. So r_x must be zero, r_y must be zero, r_z must be zero. So r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but let me think again. If I have r·σ = 0, that means each component of r is zero. Because, for example, the (1,1) element of r·σ is r_x*(1) + r_y*(0) + r_z*(1) → for it to be zero, r_x + r_z must be zero. But wait, no, wait. The matrix product r·σ is a matrix, and for it to be the zero matrix, each element must be zero.

Looking at the (1,1) element: r_x * 1 + r_y * 0 + r_z * 1 = r_x + r_z =0.

Similarly, the (1,2) element is r_x * 0 + r_y *1 + r_z *0 = r_y =0.

The (2,2) element is r_x *1 + r_y *0 + r_z * (-1) = r_x - r_z =0.

So from (1,2) element, r_y=0.

From (1,1): r_x + r_z = 0.

From (2,2): r_x - r_z =0.

If both r_x + r_z =0 and r_x - r_z =0, then adding these gives 2 r_x =0 → r_x=0. Substituting back, r_z=0. So yes, r must be (0,0,0).

So the Bloch vector is at the origin. So in the Bloch sphere, this is the completely mixed state. Which makes sense because, for a qubit, the completely mixed state is (I/2), which has zero Bloch vector.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. The length of \(\mathbf{r}\) must satisfy \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\).

For the given \(\rho\), we note that \(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| = \frac{I + \sigma_z}{2}\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = \frac{I - \sigma_z}{2}\). Substituting these into \(\rho\), we get:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{I + \sigma_z}{2} + \frac{I - \sigma_z}{2} \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this to the general form \(\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), it is clear that the term \(\frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\) must vanish, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state in the Bloch sphere, which is located at the origin.

Among the given options:

- **A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B) \(r = (0,0,1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different state.
- **C) \(r = (0,0,0)\):** Correct, as derived above.
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, \(r = (0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
