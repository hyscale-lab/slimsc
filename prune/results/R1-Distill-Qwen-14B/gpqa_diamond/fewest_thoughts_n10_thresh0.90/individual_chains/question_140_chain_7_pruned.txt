Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me try to break down the information and see what I can figure out.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, so B is probably a solid at room temperature but just melts just above that.

Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has an isotope that's heavier than the regular one. I'm trying to think of what X might be.

Let's start by considering the reaction details. Gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecule must be a compound where the number of protons (which equals the number of neutrons for the molecule as a whole) is the same. Wait, no, wait: the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Each molecule has equal numbers of both. So for example, if it's a molecule like H2O, but wait, let me think: wait, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the total protons would be (2*1) + 8 = 10, and total neutrons would be 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's a noble gas? Because noble gases are monoatomic. Let's think: which noble gas has the same number of protons and neutrons in its atom? Let's see. For example, Argon has an atomic number of 18. Its isotope might have, say, 22 neutrons (18+4). Wait, 18 protons and 22 neutrons: that's 18 each? No, wait. Wait, no, the gas's molecule (if it's monoatomic) has the same number of neutrons and protons per atom. So for each atom, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons.

So, for an atom, protons = neutrons. So the atomic number equals the number of neutrons. So the isotope would have (atomic number) = number of neutrons. So let's think about some elements.

For example, Carbon has 6 protons. If it's a Carbon-12 isotope, that's 6 neutrons. So that's equal. So a molecule of carbon (if it's a monoatomic gas, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO2 or something else. Wait, but the question says the molecule of gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like H2O, but that didn't fit earlier. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: maybe the gas is CO2. Let's see, each CO2 molecule has 2 O atoms and 1 C. So C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So for each CO2 molecule: protons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6 (since C-12), each O has 8, so 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh! So each CO2 molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits the condition. So gas W is CO2.

Wait, that makes sense. So when X reacts with Y, it releases CO2. Then, precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K (which is 4°C), so B is probably a solid that melts just above that, like water ice? No, because water's melting point is 273 K (0°C), which is close but a bit lower. Wait, maybe B is something else. Wait, maybe B is sodium chloride? No, that would have a much higher melting point.

Wait, what else has a melting point around 277 K? Maybe something like camphor? Or perhaps it's another substance. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal like mercury, but mercury's melting point is way lower. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the reaction.

The reaction is between X and Y. Since X is a reagent in organic chemistry, maybe it's a strong base or a strong acid. Let me think about possible reactions.

Wait, if X is a metal, maybe it's reacting with a liquid acid to produce CO2. For example, if X is a carbonate or a bicarbonate. Wait, but when metals react with acids, they usually produce H2 gas, not CO2. Alternatively, if Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate, then the reaction would produce CO2. Let me think: for example, CaCO3 (which is a carbonate) reacting with HCl (liquid Y) produces CO2 gas, CaCl2, and water.

So in that scenario, substance X is CaCO3, Y is HCl. The gas W is CO2. The precipitate G would be CaCl2, but wait, CaCl2 is soluble in water. Hmm, that's not a precipitate. So perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, and the precipitate is something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution, and the reaction produces a precipitate of a metal hydroxide? Wait, maybe X is a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and Y is an acid like H2SO4. Then, the reaction would produce Na2SO4, water, and possibly gas? No, that wouldn't produce CO2. Unless X is a bicarbonate.

Wait, perhaps X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Reacting with an acid like HCl would produce CO2, water, and NaCl. So the reaction would be: NaHCO3 + HCl → NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. In that case, the precipitate G would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal, and X is a carbonate or bicarbonate. Let me think again. Maybe the precipitate is a metal sulfide? Or perhaps a hydroxide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a liquid acid, producing gas. For example, metals like magnesium reacting with HCl would produce H2 gas, but in our case, the gas is CO2. So maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid.

Wait, another thought: when a carbonate reacts with an acid, you get CO2 gas. So the reaction is, say, CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. The precipitate in this case would be CaCl2, but that's soluble. Hmm, no precipitate, so that can't be right. So maybe the reaction is between a sulfite and an acid, which would produce SO2 gas. But the question says the gas is W, which has equal protons and neutrons, which in the CO2 case worked.
