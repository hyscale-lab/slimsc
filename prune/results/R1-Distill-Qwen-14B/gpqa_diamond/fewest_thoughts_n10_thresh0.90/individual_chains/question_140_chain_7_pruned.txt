Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K, which I know is around 4°C because 273 K is 0°C. So B must be a solid at that temperature, maybe something like water? Wait, melting point near 277 K is a bit higher than 0°C, so perhaps something else.

Then, the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. I need to think about what reactions involve keto acids and what kind of reagent that would be.

Substance X and its analog are used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Oh, that makes me think of something like a strong base or maybe a hydride source. Wait, when I think of reagents, maybe something like NaOH, KOH? Or maybe something else like a Grignard reagent? Wait, Grignard reagents are organometallic, but maybe this is more basic.

Let me try to break this down piece by piece.

First, the reaction of X with Y produces gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it gives B. Let's think about what that could be. Maybe X is a metal, and Y is something like water or another liquid. 

Wait, gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That means the molecular formula would have equal numbers. So, maybe H2O? No, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Wait, H2O's molecule has 2+8=10 protons, and 8 neutrons. Oh wait, no, that's not equal. Wait, no, the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons overall. So for H2O: number of protons is 2*(1) + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 8. So 10 vs 8, not equal.

Wait, maybe it's CO2? CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and two O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh, yeah, that's equal. So gas W is CO2. That makes sense.

So if W is CO2, then the reaction produces CO2. So what reaction would produce CO2 when a substance reacts with another liquid? Maybe a carbonate reacting with a strong acid? Wait, but what is Y? Or maybe it's a reaction where carbonate is decomposed, but then Y would be something else.

Wait, maybe Y is an acid, like H2SO4, and X is a carbonate. But wait, let's think again. If X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, and Y is an acid, like H2SO4, then the reaction would produce CO2 gas, water, and a sulfate precipitate maybe.

But let me think about the precipitate G. If X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, the precipitate would form if there's a product that's insoluble. Wait, but when carbonate reacts with acid, you get CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. If that salt is insoluble, it precipitates. For example, CaCO3 is insoluble, but if X is something else, like sodium carbonate, and Y is sulfuric acid, the product would be Na2SO4, which is soluble. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is water? No, because metals don't react violently with water unless they're very reactive, like potassium or sodium. But the reaction of sodium with water produces H2 gas, not CO2. So maybe Y is something else.

Wait, wait. Another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. What's a solid with a melting point around that? Maybe it's something like water ice, but water melts at 273 K (0°C). 277 K is about 4°C. Alternatively, perhaps it's some other solid. Or maybe it's another substance. Wait, 277 K is about 4.5°C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is something like sodium hydroxide? No, sodium hydroxide is a solid, but it's not melting at that point. Or maybe it's another compound. Alternatively, could B be something like CaO? No, CaO is a solid but its melting point is much higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is sodium carbonate? No, sodium carbonate is a solid but I'm not sure about its melting point. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Let's hold that thought for a moment.

Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Keto acids are like ketones with a carboxylic acid group. For example, something like acetoacetic acid. What's the reaction of a keto acid with substance X? Maybe a condensation reaction or some kind of addition.

Wait, if X is a base, perhaps it's deprotonating the keto acid. Or maybe it's a Grignard reagent, but Grignards are usually used with ketones. Alternatively, if X is something like NaOH, which could be used in elimination reactions. Or maybe X is a chlorinating agent or something else.

Wait, another thought: if X contains a heavier isotope, that could be something like Cl-35 vs Cl-37. Or perhaps it's something else. Wait, wait, but the problem says that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X contains at least two elements, one of which has a heavier isotope.

Wait, the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So the lightest and heaviest elements in X's composition. For example, if X is a compound with elements like O and Cl, then the lightest is O (atomic number 8) and the heaviest is Cl (17). So their atomic masses would be added.

But let's try to figure out what X is. Let's think about what the reaction with Y produces. If Y is water, and X is a carbonate, but when X is a carbonate reacting with an acid, like H2SO4, then the products would be CO2, water, and the corresponding sulfate. But earlier I thought the precipitate doesn't form in that case, unless the sulfate is insoluble. For example, if X is CaCO3, Y is H2SO4, the product would be CaSO4, which is insoluble, so a precipitate forms. Then, when G (CaSO4) is heated, perhaps it decomposes? CaSO4 is a solid, but heating might not do much. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a sulfite, and Y is an acid, then the reaction produces SO2 gas, not CO2. So that might not fit.

Wait, going back to the gas W being CO2. So, X and Y reacting produce CO2. So perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. Then, the precipitate G would be the corresponding salt. For instance, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is H2SO4, the reaction is:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O

In this case, Na2SO4 is soluble in water, so no precipitate. So maybe X is a different carbonate, like CaCO3. Then, reaction with H2SO4 would give CaSO4, which is insoluble, so precipitate forms.

So G is CaSO4. Then, when heated, what happens? Does CaSO4 decompose? I thought that upon heating, some sulfates decompose, but I'm not sure about the products. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else.

Wait, but the product when heated is B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So if G is CaSO4, maybe when heated, it becomes something else. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something like CaCO3, but that wouldn't form if X is CaCO3 and Y is an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is not an acid. Let me think again. So X reacts with Y to release CO2 and form G. Another scenario: maybe Y is a carbonate or something else. Alternatively, if X is a carbonate and Y is a base, but then the reaction wouldn't produce CO2. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if X is a carbonate (like Na2CO3) and Y is a strong acid like HCl, then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and NaCl. NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal, but that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, another angle: the reaction could be a decomposition reaction. For example, if X is a carbonated drink, but that's probably not it. Or perhaps X is a bicarbonate. Let's think about sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). If it reacts with an acid like H2SO4, then the reaction would be:

2 NaHCO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2 CO2↑ + 2 H2O

But that would produce Na2SO4, which is soluble, so again no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and a metal. No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a metal ion. Suppose X is a carbonate and Y is a solution of a metal like lead. Then the reaction would give a lead carbonate precipitate. But then, the gas W would be CO2. Let me write that:

For example, X is Na2CO3, Y is Pb(NO3)2 solution. The reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + Pb(NO3)2 → PbCO3↓ + 2 NaNO3

But PbCO3 is a precipitate. When PbCO3 is heated, it decomposes into PbO and CO2. So B would be PbO. What's the melting point of PbO? I'm not exactly sure, but maybe it's close to 277 K. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, but the precipitate G when heated gives B. So if G is PbCO3, upon heating:

PbCO3 → PbO + CO2↑

So B is PbO. I'm not certain about the melting point of PbO, but perhaps that's the case.

Alternatively, let's think about another possibility for gas W being CO2. Another reaction is the decomposition of a carbonate into CO2 and the metal oxide. So if X is a carbonate and Y is heat, then perhaps the reaction is:

MCO3 → MO + CO2↑

But the question says X reacts with Y (liquid) violently. So perhaps Y is not heat but another liquid.

Wait, but what if Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate. Then the reaction would give CO2, water, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, then the reaction would be:

CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O

CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Doesn't fit. So perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another angle: perhaps Y is not an acid. What if Y is a carbonate itself? No, that probably wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a different carbonate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X. The product has two oxygen atoms. So, a keto acid is a carboxylic acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid is CH3C(O)CH2COOH. Suppose X is a base. If X reacts with the keto acid, perhaps it deprotonates it. But the product would then have a certain number of oxygens.

Alternatively, if X is a reagent like NaOH, reacting with the keto acid would produce a sodium salt. Let's see, acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH) reacting with NaOH would give CH3C(O)CH2COO^- Na^+ plus water. The product would have more oxygens than the keto acid? Wait, the keto acid already has four oxygens: two from the ketone (carbonyl), and two from the carboxylic acid. So in the product, perhaps the number remains the same. Hmm, but the question says the product has two atoms of oxygen. That can't be right because the keto acid itself has more than two.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood. The product would have two oxygen atoms, so maybe it's a dehydration reaction. Or perhaps it's a condensation reaction where water is lost, but that's not necessarily reducing the number of oxygens.

Wait, maybe X is something like a strong oxidizing agent. Or perhaps it's a reducing agent. Hmm. Alternatively, X could be something like H2O2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and when it reacts with the keto acid, it displaces something, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a product with two oxygens.

Wait, another idea: if X is a base like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like glyoxylic acid (with formula HOOC-COOH?), but perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, suppose the keto acid is something like CH3COCH2COOH. When it reacts with a base like NaOH, it would lose a proton and form a salt. But the product would have the same number of oxygens as the acid, so that doesn't fit the two oxygens part.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone, but that would require losing water. For example, if a keto acid loses a water molecule to form a ketone. Let me think: if the keto acid is like CH3C(O)CH2COOH, upon losing water, it could form CH3C(O)CH2COO^- (sodium salt?), but that would still have four oxygens. Hmm, perhaps this line of thinking isn't right.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diethyl ketone or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid with two oxygen atoms, but that's impossible because a carboxylic acid has at least two oxygens in the -COOH group. So maybe the product is something like CO2, but that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me return to the initial part about X's isotopes. The question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is a compound with at least two elements, one of which has heavier isotopes. So perhaps the elements are Cl and another, like O or Na.

Wait, the reagent in organic chemistry. That makes me think of NaOH as a common reagent, but perhaps it's something else. Or maybe it's a Grignard reagent, but those are organometallic and would have Mg.

Wait, another possibility: X is a chlorinated compound. For example, maybe something like CH2Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. So the product must have two O atoms. So maybe the keto acid is being deoxygenated. Hmm, but how?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation, where CO2 is released. So for example, a keto acid losing CO2 would produce a ketone, which has fewer oxygens. Let me think: If the keto acid is something like CH3C(O)CH2COOH, upon losing CO2, it would form CH3C(O)CH3 (acetone), which has three oxygens. No, that's still more than two. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is something like a ketone with two oxygens, but that's not possible because a ketone has one oxygen in the carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the product is an alcohol, which has one oxygen. But the problem says two oxygens. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a hydroxide or something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like a methyl ketone. For example, if the keto acid is CH3COCH2COOH, and X is a reducing agent, it might reduce the carboxylic acid group to an alcohol. Wait, but that would add more oxygens.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, so maybe I should try to think about what X could be based on the other clues. Let's think again about the reaction with Y.

So, X reacts with Y violently, producing CO2 gas and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Also, X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog is used as a reagent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is a strong acid, and G is the corresponding sulfate. Then, when heated, the sulfate might decompose. Wait, but most sulfates have high melting points.

Alternatively, maybe X is a sulfide. If X is a sulfide, reacting with an acid would produce H2S gas, but that doesn't fit with W being CO2.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonate and Y is a metal. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is iron(III) chloride solution. Then the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + 2 FeCl3 → 2 NaCl + Fe2(CO3)3?

Wait, but Fe2(CO3)3 is not very soluble, so perhaps it precipitates. Then when heated, it might decompose into FeO and CO2. So B would be FeO. What's the melting point of FeO? I'm not sure, but perhaps it's around 277 K.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. But I'm not making much progress here.

Wait, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) reacting with a strong acid like H2SO4 would produce CO2, water, and Na2SO4. If Na2SO4 is soluble, then no precipitate. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of lead nitrate. X is K2CO3. Reaction would produce PbCO3 precipitate, which upon heating gives PbO and CO2. So B is PbO. What's the melting point of PbO? I think it's around 888°C, which is way higher than 277 K (which is 4°C). So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe B is something like NaOH? No, because NaOH is a solid with a high melting point.

Wait, another angle: the melting point of B is near 277 K (about 4°C). So what solid has a melting point around there? Well, water (ice) melts at 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is 4.5°C. Maybe B is something like ammonium nitrate, which has a melting point around 169°C, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different form of water, like ice. But ice melts at 0°C. Wait, perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 277 K (4°C). Wait, that might be the case. So when the precipitate G is heated, it loses water of crystallization, leaving anhydrous Na2CO3, which then perhaps decomposes? Or maybe B is the anhydrous form.

Wait, but the precipitate G would be the product of the reaction between X and Y. If X is Na2CO3 and Y is something that gives a precipitate. Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal ion that forms an insoluble carbonate. For example, if Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2, then X (Na2CO3) would react to form BaCO3 precipitate.

So the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + Ba(NO3)2 → BaCO3↓ + 2 NaNO3

BaCO3 is a precipitate. Then, when heated, BaCO3 decomposes into BaO and CO2 gas. So B would be BaO. What's the melting point of BaO? I think it's around 2222°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of calcium hydroxide. Wait, but that might not produce CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is a solution of a sulfide, but that might produce another gas.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to think of what X could be based on the other clues.

X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, etc. But if X is a carbonate, maybe it's Na2CO3 or K2CO3, which are used in some organic reactions, like saponification.

Wait, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. So if the product has two O, perhaps it's a molecule like CO2 or something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, and the product is a carboxylate. But the carboxylate would have more O's, not fewer.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration, leading to a ketone. But a ketone has one O, so that doesn't fit two O's.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone oxide or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, which has two O's. But that's not right because each ketone has one O.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, which has two OH groups, but that's two O's. But how would a keto acid react with X to form a diol? Maybe through some kind of reduction, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the product has two O atoms, so perhaps it's a molecule like CH3COOH (acetic acid) reacting with X to form something else. Wait, but acetic acid is a mono-carboxylic acid, so the product would be CH3COO^- Na^+ if X is NaOH. But that has three O's in the acid part.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation, losing CO2, which would reduce the number of O's. For example, a keto acid losing CO2 to form a ketone. Let's say the keto acid is CH3C(O)CH2COOH. If it loses CO2, it would become CH3C(O)CH3 (acetone), which has three O's, which is more than two.

Wait, perhaps the product is a molecule with two O's, like ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH), which has two OH groups and thus two O's. But how would a keto acid react with X to form that? That seems unlikely.

Another thought: maybe the product is a ketone with two O's. But that can't be because a ketone has only one O.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diethyl ketone or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a reducing agent. For example, NaBH4 is a reducing agent used in organic chemistry. If X is NaBH4, then reacting it with a keto acid (which has a carbonyl group) would reduce the carbonyl to an alcohol. But then, the product would have more O's, not fewer.

Wait, but the product has two O's. So perhaps the product is something like a methanol (CH3OH), but that's only one O.

Alternatively, if X is something like HCl, and the keto acid is something that when treated with HCl forms a chlorinated product. But I'm not sure how that would lead to two O's.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, so maybe I should try to think about the initial scenario again. Let me try to outline the possibilities:

Substance X → reacts with Y → CO2 gas, precipitate G.

G → when heated → B. B's melting point is near 277 K.

X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Its analog is also a reagent. So maybe X is something like NaOH or Na2CO3.

Let me think about the precipitate G. If G is something like CaCO3, but that wouldn't precipitate if X is CaCO3 and Y is an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a carbonate and Y is a solution of a metal ion that forms an insoluble carbonate. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is a solution of Pb(NO3)2, then the reaction would produce PbCO3 precipitate. Then, when PbCO3 is heated, it decomposes into PbO and CO2. So B would be PbO. But earlier I thought PbO's melting point is higher than 277 K, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is something else. Wait, maybe the precipitate is something like Ag2CO3. Silver carbonate. But I'm not sure about its solubility. Silver carbonate is slightly soluble in water, so maybe it would precipitate. Upon heating, it might decompose into Ag2O and CO2.

Silver oxide (Ag2O) has a melting point around 1530°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. Let's say the product has two O atoms. So the product molecule has two O atoms. That could mean it's something like CO2, but how would that happen?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation, where the keto acid loses CO2. For example, a beta-keto acid losing CO2 to form a ketone. But then, the product would have the same number of O's as the keto acid minus one (since CO2 is lost). Let's say the keto acid has four O's (two from the ketone and two from the carboxylic acid). If it loses CO2 (two O's), the product would have two O's. That fits!

So if the product has two O's, maybe it's a ketone. Let me write an example:

The keto acid is CH3C(O)CH2COOH. If it undergoes decarboxylation (losing CO2), it would form CH3C(O)CH3 (acetone), which has three O's. Oh wait, that's three O's, not two. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the keto acid is a different structure. Suppose the keto acid is something like CH3COCH2COOH. Losing CO2 would give CH3COCH3, which has three O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the keto acid is a gamma-keto acid, like CH2(CO)CH2COOH. Upon losing CO2, it would form CH2(CO)CH3, which has two O's. Oh wait, no, that's still three O's because the ketone has one O, and the CH3 group doesn't add any.

Wait, maybe the product is formaldehyde (HCHO), but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps it's something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't decarboxylation but something else. Like, the keto acid is reacting with a base to form a salt, but that doesn't change the number of O's.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, so maybe I should try to proceed with the initial reaction to identify X and Y.

If gas W is CO2, and the precipitate G is something that when heated gives B with a melting point near 277 K.

Another possibility: B is sodium carbonate decahydrate. But no, because when you heat Na2CO3·10H2O, it loses water and becomes anhydrous Na2CO3, which has a much higher melting point.

Wait, another idea: perhaps B is something like ammonium chloride. But ammonium chloride decomposes upon heating, releasing HCl and NH3, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium acetate trihydrate, which has a melting point around 277 K. Let me check: Sodium acetate trihydrate (NaC2H3O2·3H2O) has a melting point of about 277 K. Yes, I think that's correct.

So if B is sodium acetate trihydrate, then what is G? G is the precipitate formed when X reacts with Y. When G is heated, it releases B. Wait, no. According to the problem, when G is heated, it releases B. So G is something that upon heating gives B.

So if B is sodium acetate trihydrate, then perhaps G is something else that upon heating gives sodium acetate trihydrate. Hmm, but sodium acetate trihydrate is the hydrated form. When you heat it, it loses water. So maybe G is the anhydrous form, which upon heating with water (or upon absorbing water) becomes the trihydrate. But that doesn't align with the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps G is sodium acetate trihydrate, and when heated, it loses water to become anhydrous sodium acetate. No, the melting point of anhydrous sodium acetate is higher than the trihydrate.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about X again. X is a reagent in organic chemistry and has a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is NaOH, which is used as a strong base in various reactions. But NaOH doesn't have heavier isotopes in its constituent elements because it's Na and O. Wait, but sodium has isotopes. The main isotope of sodium is Na-23, but there's also Na-25 and Na-24. So perhaps X is NaOH, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of sodium.

Wait, but the question says that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So if X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23) and O (16), and H (1). Wait, but H is the lightest, O is heavier than H but lighter than Na. So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). So their atomic masses would be 1 + 23 = 24. But the options don't have 24 as an option. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Wait, but wait, the question says that if multiple instances of an element exist, sum all their masses. So for each element present in X, sum all the isotopes (their masses) and then add the lightest and heaviest elements' summed masses.

Wait, maybe I should think about the initial problem again. Let me try to approach this step by step.

1. Identify X, Y, W, G, B.

2. From the problem, W is CO2. So the reaction between X and Y produces CO2.

3. The precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

4. X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents are NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, etc.

5. The reaction of a keto acid with X produces a product with two O atoms.

Let me assume X is NaOH. Then, when it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it deprotonates it. But the product would still have O's. Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is undergoing some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, another possibility: X is a chlorinating agent. For example, Cl2 gas, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, another idea: if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, and Y is a solution of a metal that forms an insoluble carbonate. Then, the precipitate G is that carbonate. When heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. So B is the metal oxide.

If B's melting point is near 277 K, perhaps B is sodium oxide (Na2O). What's the melting point of Na2O? I think it's around 1380°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something like calcium oxide, but that's also high.

Wait, maybe B is something like sodium bicarbonate. No, because when heated, sodium bicarbonate decomposes into sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O. But that would mean B is Na2CO3, which has a higher melting point.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of X as NaOH, which is used in organic chemistry. Then, when NaOH reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it forms a salt. For example, the keto acid could be something like glyoxylic acid (HOOC-COOH), and reacting with NaOH would produce the disodium salt, which has more O's. But that doesn't fit the two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product has two O atoms, so it's a molecule with two O's. That could be something like O2, but that's a gas and unlikely. Alternatively, it's a molecule like CO2, but that's a gas as well.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl compound, like an aldehyde or ketone, which has one O. But the question says two O's.

Wait, perhaps the product is a molecule like H2O, but that's just a guess. Or maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, which has two OH groups (thus two O's), but I'm not sure how that forms from a keto acid and X.

I'm not making progress here, so perhaps I should try to think about the possible options again for the cumulative atomic masses.

The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

If X is NaOH, then the elements are Na (atomic mass ~23), O (~16), and H (~1). The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

If X is KOH, then elements K (~39), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest K (39). Sum is 40, not an option.

If X is something like Ca(OH)2, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps X is Na2CO3. Elements Na (23), C (12), O (16). Lightest is C or O? Wait, C has atomic number 6, O is 8. So the lightest element in X is C (12), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 28, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Wait, the options include 31. Let's see: elements like Cl (35.5) and O (16). If X has Cl and O, then the lightest is O (16), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 16 +35.5=51.5, not an option.

Alternatively, if X is Mg(OH)2, elements Mg (24.3), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Mg (24.3). Sum is 25.3, close to option B (25).

But earlier, I thought X might be NaOH, but that gives sum 24, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X is Na2CO3·10H2O. So the elements are Na, C, O, H. The lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24.

No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if X is something like NH4Cl, which is used as a reagent. The elements are N (14), H (1), Cl (35.5). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 36.5. Close to option A (35), but not exact.

Wait, the question says the cumulative atomic masses must be summed. So if X has multiple elements, their lightest and heaviest are summed.
