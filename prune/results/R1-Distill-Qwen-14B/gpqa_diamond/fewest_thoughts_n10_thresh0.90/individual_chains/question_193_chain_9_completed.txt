Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the angle subtended by a star at two points on Earth's orbit, and the formula I think is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, distance r is inversely proportional to parallax. So if plx increases, r decreases, and vice versa.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1 / plx^5. Let's write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, but since plx is 1/r (because r is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds), substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. Taking 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. But wait, does that mean the total number in a certain volume or the number per unit volume? Because if you have a region, the number of stars increases with the volume, which depends on distance cubed. But in this case, the number isn't following that.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The problem states that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Then, substitute plx = 1/r, so N = k * (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, that can't be right because when r increases, the number of stars in that region increases as r^5? That seems high. I mean, if you have a larger volume, the number of stars should go up with the volume, which is r^3, assuming uniform density. But here, the dependence is r^5, which is higher. So perhaps I'm misapplying the relation.

Wait, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So perhaps the number of stars per unit volume (or per some other factor) depends on parallax. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the flux or the apparent brightness, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the way the number is counted is in a certain area or something else. Let me think about the formula again. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, then N is proportional to r^5. So when the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So the number of stars goes up rapidly with distance.

But wait, that can't be correct because when you look further away, each star is dimmer, so you should see fewer stars, not more. Wait, maybe I'm getting the relationship wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer distance. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, that would mean that as parallax increases (closer distance), N increases (more stars). But when you go farther away (lower parallax), N decreases. So the number of stars observed depends on the inverse of parallax to the fifth power. So for a given region, the number of stars you can see at a certain distance is proportional to r^5. But that doesn't seem right, because when you look further away, you should see fewer stars, not more.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the way the number is presented. Let me think: the problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when parallax is small (large distance), 1/plx is large, so N is large. So for a distant region, you have more stars? That doesn't make sense because in reality, when you look further, you can't see as many stars because they're too faint. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars N is the number per unit volume. So if N is proportional to r^5, that would imply that the number density of stars increases with r^5. But that's impossible because the number density shouldn't depend on distance in a static universe unless we're considering some other factors. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me get back to the problem. The question is about how the number of stars in that region changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps it's about the differential number of stars per unit distance. So we can model the number of stars as a function of distance.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r, this gives N = kr^5, where k is a proportionality constant. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. But that would mean that in a larger region, you're finding more stars, which doesn't align with real observations. But perhaps the question is hypothetical, and we have to go with the given relation.

Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake in interpreting the question. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for each unit of parallax, how does the number change with r. So perhaps it's not about the total number in a region, but the number per unit distance or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume. So the number density is N = kr^5, but that's impossible because number density shouldn't increase with distance. Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a given volume is N = kr^5, so as r grows, N grows as r^5. But that's difficult to imagine because the volume grows as r^3, so number would go up as r^3 if density is constant. But here, it's r^5. Maybe the density increases with r^2, leading to N = (r^3) * (density), and if density is kr^2, then N = kr^5.

Hmm, maybe. So if the density of stars increases with distance squared, then the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr would be 4πr² dr * (density). If density is proportional to r², then the number in that shell is 4π r² dr * (k r²) ) = 4π k r^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) would be proportional to r^4. But that's for a differential in r.

Wait, the question is asking how the number changes with distance per unit range of distance. So per unit r, perhaps the number of stars is increasing as r^4. But wait, the options have r^5, r^4, etc. So perhaps the correct answer is r^5, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit area, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a region is proportional to r^5, so the change in number with distance is r^5. But that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, plx = 1/r, so N is proportional to r^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So the number of stars in that region goes up with r^5. So the answer would be option B) ~ r^5.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. In reality, when you look further, you see fewer stars because they're fainter. Oh wait, but in this problem, the number of stars seems to increase with distance. That's odd. But perhaps the problem is set in a scenario where more distant regions have more stars, perhaps in a hypothetical universe where stars are more densely packed at larger distances. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the question says: the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the way the number is counted is per some unit. Let's think about this: parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so 1/plx is proportional to distance. So if the number of stars N is proportional to (1/plx)^5, then N is proportional to r^5.

So the number of stars in that region increases as r^5. So the correct answer is B) ~r^5.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, the number of stars becomes:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

This means the number of stars in the region increases as \( r^5 \) with distance. While this result seems counterintuitive in a real-world context (where one would expect fewer stars at greater distances due to dimming), the problem explicitly provides this relationship, so we must follow it.

Thus, the number of stars in the region changes with distance as \( r^5 \).

Answer: B
