Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the oxidizing power of oxygen in basic and acidic solutions, and how it reacts kinetically in those conditions.

Wait, the question says that thermodynamically, oxygen is a ….. oxidant in basic solutions. And kinetically, it reacts ….. in acidic solutions. The options are about whether it's stronger or weaker, and faster or slower.

Hmm, I remember that the oxidizing power can be influenced by the solution's pH. Let me think about the thermodynamic part first. In basic solutions, the pH is high, so OH- ions are abundant. Oxygen is a good oxidizing agent, and I think about the standard reduction potentials. In acidic solution, O2 is reduced to water. The standard reduction potential for that reaction is around +1.23 V. But wait, how does pH affect this?

Oh right! The Nernst equation comes into play here. The reduction potential depends on the concentration of the reactants. For O2 in basic solution, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-. The standard E° for this is about +0.401 V. Wait, but in acidic solution, the same O2 would have a higher E°, right? Because the reaction is O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O, with E° of +1.23 V. So in acidic conditions, O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent because the E° is higher. But the question is about basic solutions. So in basic, the E° is lower, but does that make O2 a weaker oxidant?

Wait wait, no, no. Because the question says "thermodynamically, oxygen is a ….. oxidant in basic solutions." So when the solution is basic, compared to acidic, is O2 a stronger or weaker oxidant?

In acidic solution, O2 has higher E°, so it's a stronger oxidant. So in basic, since E° is lower, O2 is a weaker oxidant compared to when it's in acid. So the first blank should be 'weaker' because in basic conditions, the oxidizing power is less than in acidic.

Now the kinetic part. Kinetically, how does O2 react in acidic vs basic solutions. I'm a bit rusty here, but I think the reaction rate is influenced by the concentration of H+ ions. Because in acidic solution, H+ is high, which might make the reaction proceed faster, but wait, the reaction for O2 in acidic solution would involve H+.

Wait, the reaction in acidic is O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O. So the rate of reaction would depend on the concentration of H+ as a reactant. Higher H+ concentration (as in acidic) would mean a higher reaction rate, right? So kinetically, O2 reacts faster in acidic solutions.

So putting it together: Thermodynamically in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant. Kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic. So the blanks should be filled with 'weaker' and 'faster'.

Looking at the options:

Option C is weaker – faster. So the correct combination is weaker and faster, which is option C.


The question involves determining the oxidizing power of oxygen (O₂) in basic and acidic solutions, both thermodynamically and kinetically. 

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**:  
   The standard reduction potential for O₂ in basic solution (O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻) is +0.401 V, while in acidic solution (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O), it is +1.23 V. Since the reduction potential in acidic solution is higher, O₂ is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Analysis**:  
   The reaction rate of O₂ depends on the concentration of H⁺ ions. In acidic solutions, the concentration of H⁺ is higher, which facilitates the reaction (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O). As a result, O₂ reacts **faster** in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions.

Combining these results, the correct answer is that oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant thermodynamically in basic solutions and reacts **faster** kinetically in acidic solutions.

Answer: C
