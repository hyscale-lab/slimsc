Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the question gives me the state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states. The state is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) divided by a normalization constant N. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to compute the non-Gaussianity, which is the relative entropy between the state and a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, the formula for non-Gaussianity is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So, that's the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. But wait, the relative entropy between rho and tau is usually defined as S(rho||tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau). But here, the formula is a bit different. Oh, wait, the problem states that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So, perhaps in this case, the relative entropy measure is using tau as the reference, so maybe del_b is the difference in their entropies. Wait, but that doesn't quite align with what I know. Let me think again.

Oh wait, relative entropy usually measures how different rho is from tau. So S(rho||tau) would be tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau). But the question's formula is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)]. That's a bit confusing. Or perhaps the question is using the B relative entropy, which for qubit states might be different. Hmm, maybe I should proceed under the given formula.

But wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity (nG) is being measured as the difference between the entropy of the non-Gaussian state and a Gaussian one. Because Gaussian states have certain entropy properties. So if tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps the nG is this difference.

But regardless, I need to compute del_b as per the given formula. So, to do that, I need the density matrices rho and tau.

First, let's find rho. The state |psi> is a superposition, so rho is |psi><psi|. Let me write that out.

|psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N

So rho = |psi><psi| = (1/N²) [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ][ <alpha| cos(phi) + < -alpha | sin(phi) ]

Expanding this, rho would have terms:
cos²(phi) |alpha><alpha| 
+ sin²(phi) |-alpha><-alpha|
+ cos(phi) sin(phi) [ |alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ]

Wait, but when you take the outer product, it's |alpha><-alpha| and |-alpha><alpha|, which are not diagonal in the coherent state basis. So rho would be a mixed state that's a combination of these terms.

But wait, the density matrix for a coherent state |alpha> is pure, with rho being |alpha><alpha|. But when you have a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix becomes a mixture of these states plus some off-diagonal terms which are not diagonal in the coherent state basis.

However, the problem states that tau is a Gaussian state. But wait, the state |psi> itself is a superposition of Gaussian states, making it non-Gaussian. So, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the maximally mixed state or another Gaussian state. Alternatively, maybe tau is the closest Gaussian state to |psi>, in which case, perhaps we can compute the mutual information or something else.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck on the exact steps. Let's see.

First, I should compute N. Given phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Compute sin(2*phi) first. 2*phi is 2*(-pi/4) = -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1.

Then exp(-2 alpha²) when alpha=0.5: 2*(0.5)^2 = 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is approximately 1/(sqrt(e)) which is about 0.6065.

So sin(2*phi) * exp(-2 alpha²) = (-1) * 0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

So N is sqrt(1 + (-0.6065)) → sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that more accurately. 1 - 0.6065 is 0.3935. The square root of 0.3935 is approximately 0.6275. So N ≈ 0.6275.

So now, the state |psi> is [ cos(-pi/4) |0.5> + sin(-pi/4) |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

But cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> is [ (0.7071)|0.5> - (0.7071)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

So, the coefficients are (0.7071 / 0.6275) each, but with a negative sign on the second term.

So, each term's coefficient is approximately 0.7071 / 0.6275 ≈ 1.126. Hmm, that's interesting because the squared magnitude would be (1.126)^2 ≈ 1.268, but wait, that's not possible since the state should be normalized. Wait, perhaps I should recompute N.

Wait, wait. Let me compute N correctly. Let me compute 1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2 alpha²) with phi = -pi/4, alpha=0.5.

phi = -pi/4 → 2*phi = -pi/2. So sin(2*phi) is -1.

alpha² = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So 2 alpha² = 0.5. exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So sin(2 phi)*exp(-2 alpha²) = (-1) * 0.6065 = -0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935. So N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So N is about 0.6275.

So the coefficients in |psi> are (0.7071 / 0.6275) for |alpha> and (-0.7071 / 0.6275) for |-alpha>.

So each's magnitude squared is approximately (0.7071)^2 / (0.6275)^2 = (0.5) / (0.3935) ≈ 1.2698. But wait, that's impossible because |a|^2 + |b|^2 must be 1 for a normalized state.

Wait, wait! Wait, |psi> is (a|alpha> + b| -alpha> ) / N, where a = cos(phi) and b = sin(phi).

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 divided by N squared is (|a|^2 + |b|^2) / N^2.

But since N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 ), and |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos²(phi) + sin²(phi) = 1. So |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1. So (1) / N^2 = 1/(0.3935) ≈ 2.54, which can't be right because that would make the squared terms larger than 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait, N is the normalization factor, so |psi> is (a|alpha> + b| -alpha> ) / N. So, the norm is |a|^2 (|alpha|^2 ?) No, no, wait. The inner product of |alpha> with itself is 1, because coherent states are normalized. Similarly for |-alpha>.

Wait, because |alpha> is a coherent state, <alpha|alpha> = 1, same for |-alpha>.

So, the inner product of |a|² + |b|² + cross terms, but when you compute |psi><psi|, you have:

rho = (a|alpha> + b| -alpha> ) (a* <alpha| + b* < -alpha| ) / N².

Expanding this, the diagonal terms would be |a|^2 |alpha><alpha| + |b|^2 |-alpha><-alpha|, and the off-diagonal terms are a b* |alpha>< -alpha| + a* b |-alpha><alpha|.

So, the density matrix rho has terms |alpha><alpha| and |-alpha><-alpha|, each scaled by |a|² and |b|², respectively, divided by N², plus the cross terms.

But for the purpose of calculating the entropy, perhaps we need the eigenvalues of rho. Because the von Neumann entropy is the sum of -lambda_i log lambda_i, where lambda_i are the eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. So rho is a mixed state. Let me think: what's the eigenvalues of rho?

But calculating the entropy requires knowing the eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by looking at the structure of rho.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the probabilities of each term. Because if the cross terms are zero, then the state would be a mixture of the two coherent states. But in our case, the cross terms are not zero because a and b are both non-zero. Wait, but wait: in the case where a and b are real, then the cross terms would be a*b |alpha><-alpha| + a*b |-alpha><alpha|.

Wait, but in our case, a = cos(phi), which when phi is -pi/4, is cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071. b is sin(phi) which is sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.7071.

So a is positive, b is negative. So a*b is (0.7071)(-0.7071) = -0.5. So the cross terms would be (-0.5) |alpha><-alpha| + (0.5) |-alpha><alpha|.

Wait, but how does this affect the density matrix?

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a pure state, so its entropy is zero because it's a pure state. Wait, no, wait: wait, the state |psi> is a pure state because it's written as a single vector, so rho is pure, so S(rho) = 0. But wait, no, wait. No, the entropy is not zero when rho is a mixed state. Wait, no, rho is a pure state because it's in a superposition. Because |psi> is a pure state, so rho = |psi><psi| is pure, so its entropy is zero. Wait, but I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake. Wait, the state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. So the von Neumann entropy S(rho) = 0. But wait, that can't be right because in this case, rho is a superposition, so it's a pure state, which would have S=0.

But then the non-Gaussianity would be 0 if tau is the same as rho, but tau is a Gaussian state. But wait, |psi> is non-Gaussian, so tau is a Gaussian state. Hmm, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is the entropy difference between rho and the nearest Gaussian state.

Wait, but the formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Since rho is a pure state, trace(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b would be - trace(tau ln tau).

But that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait, maybe I should think again. The relative
