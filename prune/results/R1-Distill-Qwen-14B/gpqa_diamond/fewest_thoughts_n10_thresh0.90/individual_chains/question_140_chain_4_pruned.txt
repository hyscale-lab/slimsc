Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. Let's break down what each part says.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X is probably a molecule that has at least two different isotopes of one element. Maybe something like Cl in Cl2, but wait, Cl has isotopes, but Cl2 is diatomic. Or maybe it's something else where isotopes are common, like O or H?

Next, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, so W is a gas where protons = neutrons. Common gases... Maybe hydrogen? No, because H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Or maybe CO2? No, wait. Wait, W is a gas, so possibilities include H2O, but wait, that's a liquid. Or maybe CO2 is a gas, but its molecule is CO2 which is a linear molecule. Wait, but the gas's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible candidates.

Wait, the only gas that comes to mind is CO2, but let me think. Let me think of elements where their atoms have equal protons and neutrons. For example, O has 8 protons. If a molecule has same protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like O where the isotope has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, but wait, that's oxygen-16. But O16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So if the molecule is O2, then each O atom would have 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Hmm, but O2 is a diatomic gas. So W could be O2. But wait, O2's molecule has two atoms. Each has 8 protons, so total protons in molecule is 16. Neutrons per O16 is 8 each, so total 16. So yes, W is O2. Because protons + neutrons in each atom? Wait, the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, no, the molecule's total protons equal total neutrons.

Wait, the gas W has same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So for example, if W is CO2, each C has 6 protons. Each O has 8. So CO2 has 6+8*2=22 protons. Neutrons would require, each C has 6 neutrons, O has 8 each. So total neutrons would be 6 + 8*2=22. So CO2's molecule would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That works. So W could be CO2. But wait, CO2 is a gas, yes. So that's a possibility.

Alternatively, what about H2O? Each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Total protons would be 2*1 +8=10. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8. So total neutrons 8. So
