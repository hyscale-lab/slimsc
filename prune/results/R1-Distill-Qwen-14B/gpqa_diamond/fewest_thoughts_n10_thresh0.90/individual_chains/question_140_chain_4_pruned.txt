Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

So, the problem is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog is. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay, let me try to identify each part.

First, let's think about Substance X. It incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, X might be a compound with an isotope like deuterium, which is a heavy isotope of hydrogen. Or maybe something else like sulfur with a heavy isotope. But since X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, that makes me think of something common. Maybe X is something like D₂O (heavy water), but I'm not sure yet.

The reaction with liquid Y is violent. Let's think about what liquids react violently. Maybe Y is something like water? Or perhaps another solvent. Wait, if X is heavy water, then reacting it with a strong base or acid could release gas. Alternatively, if Y is an acid or base.

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, W is a molecule where the total number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas (H₂) has 0 neutrons and 2 protons, which doesn't fit. Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (He is a noble gas, but He doesn't form a molecule). Wait, maybe CO₂? No, that's a gas, but the molecule would have C (6 protons) and each O has 8, so total protons would be 6 + 16 = 22, and neutrons would be different. Wait, maybe the gas is something like CH4? No, that doesn't fit. Oh, wait, maybe it's H₂O? But H₂O has 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons would be 2 + 8 =10, and neutrons would be 8. Oh, that's 10 protons and 8 neutrons—no, that's not the same. Hmm.

Wait another thought: The gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, protons in all atoms equals neutrons in all atoms. Or perhaps the molecule as a whole has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think for a molecule like CO₂. Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's C-12). Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if O-16). So CO₂ would have (6 + 8*2) protons = 6 +16=22. Neutrons would be 6 (from C) + 8*2=22. So protons=22, neutrons=22. Oh! Wait, that fits. So W could be CO₂? But wait, CO₂ is a gas, but does the reaction produce CO₂?

Alternatively, maybe W is something else. Let me think again. If the gas is CO₂, then Y could be a carbonate reacting with something. But wait, what's the reaction with X (heavy isotope) and Y (liquid) producing CO₂?

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like NH3. Wait, NH3 has 14 protons (1 for N and 3 H) and 14 neutrons? Wait, N is 7 protons, 7 neutrons. H is 1 each. So NH3 would have 7 +3=10 protons, and 7 + 0=7 neutrons. No, that doesn't match.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y violently, producing gas W, precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, and B's melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substance has a melting point near that? Maybe a solid that's just above freezing at room temp. Or perhaps it's a metal with a low melting point? Or maybe something like water ice, which melts at 273 K (close to 277). Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. So B might be something that solidifies around that temperature. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid like paraffin or some organic compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, B could be a metal like mercury, which has a melting point around -39°C, but that's not near 277 K. Wait, 277 K is 4°C. So maybe B is a solid that melts around that temperature. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid that when heated, gives off some gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's consider that when G is heated, it releases B. So G is a precipitate that, upon heating, decomposes to give B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and B is CO₂? No, because then when you heat G, you get CO₂ gas? Or maybe G is a hydroxide, and heating gives B as a metal.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. Suppose X is heavy water (D₂O), and Y is a strong acid or base. If Y is a base, like NaOH, then D₂O + NaOH wouldn't react much. Maybe if Y is a metal, but that's not a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a liquid like ethanol or something else.

Wait, maybe Y is a liquid like a hydrocarbon, but that's not reacting violently. Alternatively, Y could be another solvent like diethyl ether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The product of a keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. Keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid or something like that. When X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. So, perhaps X is acting as a base or a reducing agent. If X is a base, like NaOH, but that's a solid. Wait, but X is a substance with a heavy isotope of one element. So maybe X is something like D₂O, heavy water.

If X is D₂O, then when it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it deuterates it. So the product would have O replaced by OD or something. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the keto acid has two acidic protons, and X replaces them with deuterium. But the product after reaction has two O atoms, so perhaps it's something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a keto acid (like a β-keto acid) and something else. If X is a base, like NH3, but again, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reaction with Y. If X is D2O and Y is a strong acid,
