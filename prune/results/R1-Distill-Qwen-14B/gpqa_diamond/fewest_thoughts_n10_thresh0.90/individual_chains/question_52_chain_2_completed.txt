Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked. 

So the problem is about a star with certain parameters—1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Now, the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the overall ratio is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots). 

The transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Å. Oh, right, that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far UV? Wait, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the vacuum UV. Hmm, but maybe that's a red herring for the problem.

The question says to assume the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). So, we can use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n1/n2) is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature changes, which affects this ratio.

Wait, but the spots themselves are cooler regions, right? So when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. But what's the actual temperature of the spots? Because the star's surface is a mix of hotter and cooler regions. Wait, no, the spots are dark, which usually implies they are cooler. So the spots themselves are at a lower temperature than the rest of the photosphere.

Wait, but the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Oh, wait, maybe the overall effective temperature is an average, but the actual question is about the photosphere, which is the unspotted regions plus the spotted regions. Wait, no—that's confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K. Or wait, perhaps each part (the spotted and unspotted regions) has their own temperature. Hmm, but the problem states that the overall effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So maybe it's a combination of two areas with different temperatures.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels is being observed in the photosphere. So the photosphere as a whole—so when the star has spots, the average temperature is lower, so the ratio of the levels would change based on that average temperature. Or perhaps the spots are cooler, so the contribution from the cooler regions affects the overall observed line ratio.

Wait, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present. So the effective temperature is lower, which affects the ionization and excitation states of the atoms.

Wait, but the problem is specifically about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So perhaps it's about the ionization balance—wait, no, because it's the ratio of neutral atoms in two energy levels. So the ionization state (like how many are neutral vs ionized) affects the number of neutral Ti atoms, but the question is about their distribution between two energy levels within the neutral Ti.

So, given that, the Boltzmann equation applies. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. So T goes from 6000 K to 5500 K.

Wait, but wait a second. When the spots are present, only 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So the effective temperature is a blackbody average. The star emits as a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. So the effective temperature is the square root of the weighted average of the blackbody fluxes.

So perhaps the effective temperature when 40% is covered is Teff^2 = 0.6 * T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 * T_spotted^4. But the problem states that the Teff is 5500 K in that case. But without knowing T_spotted, this might complicate things.

Hmm, but the problem says that the photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. Or maybe the spots are cooler, but the majority of the surface is at 6000 K.

Wait, the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. So without spots, the star's photosphere is at 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K.

Wait, but the effective temperature is a measure that depends on the total emitted flux. So the star's total luminosity is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions.

So, the effective temperature is given by:

Teff^4 * 4π R^2 = F_total * 4π R^2

So, Teff^4 = (F_unspotted * f_unspotted) + (F_spotted * f_spotted)

Where f_unspotted is the fraction of the surface that's unspotted (0.6) and f_spotted is 0.4.

Each F is the flux from each region, which is sigma * T^4, where T is the temperature of that region.

So,

Teff^4 = 0.6 * T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 * T_spotted^4

But in this scenario, when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K. So,

5500^4 = 0.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * T_spotted^4

Wait, is that correct? Or is it the opposite: when the star has spots, the unspotted regions might have a higher temperature? No, wait, the spots are cooler regions, so the unspotted regions would still be at 6000 K. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, when the star has spots, the spots are cooler, so the rest (unspotted) is at the same temperature as the original, 6000 K, right?

So, substituting:

5500^4 = 0.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 * T_spotted^4

So, solving for T_spotted.

Let me compute the numbers.

Compute 5500^4 and 6000^4.

But wait, maybe I can compute the equation in terms without calculating the actual numbers.

Let me denote T_eff = 5500, T_un = 6000, T_sp = ?

So,

T_eff^4 = 0.6 * T_un^4 + 0.4 * T_sp^4

Let me rearrange:

0.4 * T_sp^4 = T_eff^4 - 0.6 * T_un^4

So,

T_sp^4 = [ T_eff^4 - 0.6 T_un^4 ] / 0.4

Wait, but wait, this may result in a negative number, which can't be. So I need to check if T_eff^4 is greater than 0.6 T_un^4.

Wait, let's compute 0.6 * 6000^4 and compare it to 5500^4.

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

Compute 5500^4: 5.5e3^4 = 5.5^4 *1e12 = (915.0625) * 1e12 = 9.150625e14.

So 0.6 * T_un^4 = 7.776e14.

T_eff^4 = 9.150625e14.

So,

T_sp^4 = (9.150625e14 - 7.776e14) / 0.4

Compute numerator:

9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = (9.150625 -7.776) e14 = 1.374625e14.

Divide by 0.4: 1.374625e14 / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

So T_sp^4 =3.4365625e14.

T_sp = (3.4365625e14 )^(1/4)

Compute (3.4365625e14 )^(1/4):

First, compute the fourth root.

Approximate the exponents:

1e14 is (1e3.5)^4, since (1e3.5)^4= (1e3.5)^2 * (1e3.5)^2 = 1e7 * 1e7 = 1e14.

So 3.4365625e14 is approximately 3.436e14 = 3.436 * 1e14.

So, fourth root of 3.436e14 is (3.436)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4) = (3.436)^(0.25) * 1e3.5.

Wait, 1e3.5 is 10^3.5 = 3162.27766 approximately.

What's (3.436)^(0.25)?

Well, 3^0.25 is about 1.316. 3.436 is a bit bigger. Let me compute sqrt(sqrt(3.436)).

Compute sqrt(3.436) ≈ 1.853.

Then sqrt(1.853) ≈ 1.361.

So approximately 1.361.

So, 1.361 * 3162 ≈ 4305 K.

So the spot temperature is approximately 4305 K.

Wait, but that's a lot lower than the unspotted regions. So now, when the star is spotted, the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spots are at about 4305 K.

But how does this affect the ratio of Ti atoms in the two energy levels?

Wait, the line corresponds to a transition at 1448 Å. So this is probably an electronic transition. So when Ti is in the neutral state, it has certain excitation levels.

The ratio of the populations in two energy levels depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann equation: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Assuming that the energy difference between the two levels is fixed, the ratio depends exponentially on 1/T.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K, but actually, it's a mix of 6000 K (60%) and 4305 K (40%). But the observed line is formed in the photosphere, which is a blend of these regions. Hmm, but how does this affect the observed ratio? Because each region contributes differently to the line.

But the problem states that the ratio observed decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So without spots, higher ratio.

Wait, but wait, the ratio depends on the temperature of the region. Let me think: in hotter regions, the ratio could be higher or lower, depending on the energy levels.

Wait, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then higher T would decrease the exponent, making the ratio smaller.

Wait, let me clarify:

If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive.

So for a higher temperature T, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller. So the exponent is smaller, so exp() is larger.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) ]

So for higher T, the ratio n1/n2 is larger if E2>E1.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say E2 > E1. So (E2-E1) is positive. Then, when T increases, the denominator kT increases, so the whole fraction (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So the exponent is negative, but a smaller magnitude. So exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller. So higher T makes exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) larger. So n1/n2 increases with T.

So for a higher T, the lower energy level (E1) is more populated relative to E2.

Wait, but wait. Because in higher temperatures, the atoms have more thermal energy, so they can be excited to higher energy levels. So the higher energy level (E2) would have a higher population in a hotter gas. So that would imply that when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 (lower level to higher level) would decrease.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me take a concrete example. Suppose E2 - E1 is 10 eV.

At T = 1000 K, (k is 8.617e-5 eV/K). So (E2-E1)/(k T) = 10 / (8.617e-5 * 1000) ≈ 10 / 0.08617 ≈ 116. So exp(-116) is practically zero. So n1/n2 ≈ (g1/g2) * 0. So n2 is much larger.

At T = 10000 K, (E2-E1)/(k T) = 10 / (8.617e-5 * 1e4) = 10 / (0.8617) ≈ 11.6. exp(-11.6) is about 8e-6. So n1/n2 ≈ 8e-6 * (g1/g2). So lower than the previous case.

Wait, but wait, in this case, as T increases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Because the higher energy level becomes more populated, so the lower level is less populated relative to the higher.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) the ratio is lower. But without spots, the effective temperature is higher (6000 K), so the ratio would be higher.

Wait, so without spots, higher T leads to higher n1/n2 ratio. But in our example, higher T leads to lower n1/n2 ratio. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, maybe I have the ratio the wrong way around. Because the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2. So if temperature increases, does the ratio increase or decrease?

Wait, let's get back to the equation.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive.

At higher T, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-x) is larger, so n1/n2 is larger. So higher T would mean a higher ratio of n1/n2.

Wait, but in my concrete example, higher T led to a lower n1/n2. So perhaps I made a mistake in that example.

Wait, in my example, E2-E1 is 10 eV. But for typical atomic transitions, the energy differences are much smaller. For example, in Ti, the transition at 1448 Å corresponds to about 86.3 eV (since E = hc/lambda, hc ~ 12400 eV Å, so 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.58 eV). So the energy difference is about 8.58 eV.

So let's redo the example with E=8.58 eV.

At T = 6000 K:

(E)/(k T) = 8.58 / ( (8.617e-5 eV/K) * 6000 K )

Calculate denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6e3 = 0.517 eV.

So 8.58 / 0.517 ≈ 16.6.

exp(-16.6) ≈ 1.1e-7.

So n1/n2 ≈ (g1/g2) * 1.1e-7.

At T = 5500 K:

Denominator: 8.617e-5 * 5.5e3 = 0.4739 eV.

8.58 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.12.

exp(-18.12) ≈ 1.5e-8.

So n1/n2 ≈ (g1/g2) * 1.5e-8.

So when temperature decreases from 6000 to 5500 K, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower, so the ratio is lower. Which matches the problem statement.

So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp(-8.58/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-8.58/(k*5500)) ) ].

The g1/g2 terms cancel out.

So the factor is exp( [ (8.58/(k*5500)) - (8.58/(k*6000)) ] )

Wait, because n1/n2 = exp( - E/(k T) ), so the ratio is exp( E/(k T_spot) - E/(k T_unspot) )

Wait, because:

(n1/n2)_unspot = exp( -E/(k T_unspot) )

(n1/n2)_spot = exp( -E/(k T_spot) )

So the ratio (unspot / spot) is exp( [ -E/(k T_unspot) + E/(k T_spot) ] ) = exp( E/(k) [ 1/(T_spot) - 1/(T_unspot) ] )

Wait, E is positive, so let's compute this.

E = 8.58 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So E/k = 8.58 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99561 K.

So,

Factor = exp( 99561 * [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] )

Compute the term inside the exponent:

(1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 1 / 66,000.

So,

99561 * [ 1/66000 ] ≈ 99561 / 66000 ≈ 1.508.

So,

Factor ≈ exp(1.508) ≈ e^1.508.

What's e^1.5? e^1 is ~2.718, e^0.5 is ~1.648. So e^1.5 ≈ 4.481. e^1.508 is a bit higher. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.508 is approximately 1.5 + 0.008.

e^1.5 = 4.4817.

e^(0.008) ≈ 1 + 0.008 + 0.008^2/2 + ... ≈ 1.008032.

So e^1.508 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.008032 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.008032) → approximately 4.4817 + 0.0360 = 4.5177.

So approximately 4.52.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which corresponds to an energy difference \(E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\). Using \(hc = 12400 \, \text{eV·Å}\), we calculate:
   \[
   E_2 - E_1 = \frac{12400}{1448} \approx 8.58 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K when there are no spots and 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. The ratio of the populations depends on the temperature of the photosphere.

3. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
   \]

4. Substituting the Boltzmann equation into the factor:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
   \]

### Calculation:
- \(E_2 - E_1 = 8.58 \, \text{eV}\),
- \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\),
- \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\),
- \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\).

First, calculate the term inside the exponential:
\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{8.58}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99561 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, calculate the temperature difference term:
\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Find a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} = \frac{1}{66,000}.
\]

Now, multiply by \(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k}\):
\[
99561 \times \frac{1}{66,000} \approx 1.508.
\]

Finally, calculate the exponential:
\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.508).
\]

Using \(e^{1.5} \approx 4.4817\) and \(e^{1.508} \approx 4.5177\), the factor is approximately \(4.52\).

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is approximately **4.5**.
