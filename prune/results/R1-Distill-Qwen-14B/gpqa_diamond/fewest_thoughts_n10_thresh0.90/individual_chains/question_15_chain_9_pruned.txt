Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the scenario is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe which one transits more often because they have limited time. They've already found both using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Wait, actually, the question says Planet_1 has a shorter period, so if Planet_2's period is longer. Oh wait, no, Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 300 days, Planet_1's is 100 days. So Planet_1 is closer in, orbiting faster.

Both have circular orbits, so no eccentricity issues. The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So, higher mass but same radius â€” so Planet_1's star is more massive but not bigger.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. The formula for transit probability is something like (R_p / a)^2, but wait, I think it's more like (R_p / a) * something else. Oh wait, no, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet)^2 divided by (a * (1 - e^2))^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so it's just (R_p + R_s)/a, but I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis.

Wait, I think the transit probability formula is (R_p / a)^2, but that's not quite right. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital size to the star's radius. More accurately, the probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I might have that wrong. Alternatively, the formula is (R_planet / a) * (R_star / a), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think another approach is needed. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The key factors are the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. The probability is higher when the star is smaller and the planet's orbit is closer, or when the orbit is more edge-on.

Wait, the formula I remember is: the probability P is approximately (R_* + R_p) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's often approximated as (R_*) / a. Because for Earth-like planets, the planet's radius is negligible compared to the star.

So
