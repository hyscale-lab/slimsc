Okay, so I have this question about planets and transits, right? Hmm, I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should choose that one to observe.

The two planets are Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. 

Wait, I think the probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But more specifically, I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on, which is when the transit occurs. But how do we calculate the probability without knowing the inclination?

Oh right, the probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbital distance is such that it's more likely to cross our line of sight. The formula I remember is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, but wait, maybe it's more about the planet's orbital distance relative to the star's size. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

I think the transit probability (P) for a planet is given by P = (R_star / a) * ( (1 + R_p / R_s) / (sqrt(1 - e²) * (1 - i)) ), but wait, no, that's for the duration or something else. Alternatively, I recall that the probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance of the planet. But wait, more accurately, the probability is roughly (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis. Because a is the average distance, and for circular orbits, it's the same as the radius.

Wait, no, I think the formula is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (something else maybe). Alternatively, I've heard that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_*/a) where R_* is the star's radius, and a is the orbital radius (semi-major axis). Because the planet's orbit must be aligned edge-on, and the chance of that is (R_* / a), since the star's size compared to the distance determines how likely the planet will pass
