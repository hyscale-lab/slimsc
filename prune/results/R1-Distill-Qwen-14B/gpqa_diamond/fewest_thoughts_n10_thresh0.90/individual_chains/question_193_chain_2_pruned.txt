Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if something is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So, I need to connect the number of stars N to the parallax and then relate that to distance. The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. 

Since parallax (plx) is 1/distance (d), I can write plx as 1/d. So substituting that into the equation, N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) which is the same as N ∝ d^5. Wait, that's because (1/(1/d))^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so it's the rate of change, like the derivative. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N with respect to d would be something like 5d^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of distance. 

Looking at the options, option C is r^4, which should be the correct answer. Let me check the options again: A is r^3, B is r^5, C is r^4, D is r^2. Yes, so option C makes sense because the derivative of d^5 is 5d^4, so the star count per unit distance would go as d^4.


The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), we can write \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). Substituting this into the equation, \( N \propto d^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \). This corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which is \( \frac
