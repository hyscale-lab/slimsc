Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with light moving through different media, the index of refraction plays a big role. And since the glass is moving, I think relativistic effects might come into play, but wait, the options include variables multiplied by v, which is probably a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, the question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity. Since it's moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is going towards the observer. I remember that in the case of a medium moving relative to an observer, the speed of light within that medium doesn't just add velocities in a simple way because light's speed in vacuum is constant. Oh wait, but this isn't a vacuumâ€”it's glass.

The speed of light in glass is usually c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum and n is the refractive index. But what happens when the glass itself is moving? I'm trying to recall the concept of Galilean addition vs. relativistic addition.

In Galilean transformations, velocities add linearly. So if the glass is moving at velocity v, then the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame would be (v + c/n), assuming the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, but wait, the light is propagating through the glass which is moving. So the glass's motion affects how we perceive the light's speed.

Wait, maybe I should think about the frame of the glass. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n (since in the glass, the speed is c/n). But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab's perspective, the speed should be the sum of the glass's velocity and the speed of the light in the glass's frame.

Wait, but in Galilean addition (non-relativistic), velocities add up. So lab frame: v_glass = v. Glass frame: v_light = c/n. So the total speed in lab would be v + (c/n) = v + 1/n, since c is taken as 1.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option that is simply v + 1/n. Let me check the options again.

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v)
Option B: 1
Option C: (1 + n v)/(n - v)
Option D: (1
