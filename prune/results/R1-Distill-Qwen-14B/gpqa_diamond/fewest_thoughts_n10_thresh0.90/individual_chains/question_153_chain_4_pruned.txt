Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each being a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: Reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It's a diethyl malonate derivative but with methyl groups. The E-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor here. In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound at the beta position.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me draw this in my mind. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 (but with the E configuration and a p-tolyl group somewhere). Wait, no, wait: E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, right? So the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=COOCH3. Wait, or is it the other way around? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but here, the E is on the 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2-p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl at carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-p-tolyl, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-O-(p-tolyl)CH3? No, wait. Maybe the
