Okay, so I've got this problem here about quantum mechanics operators and uncertainty. Hmm, let me start by understanding what's given.

The problem says that operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these has a matrix form given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh, right, so the eigenstates of P_z form the basis for this space.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩.

Wait, but since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, if the state is |ψ⟩, and it's expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors, which are eigenstates of P_z, then ψ is a vector in that basis.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the given state is in the eigenstate of P_x. So it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. Because P_x and P_z don't commute, I think. Because in quantum mechanics, operators that don't commute have non-overlapping eigenstates.

So the state is a superposition of the basis states which are eigenstates of P_z. So to find the expectation value of P_z, I'll have to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Let me write down what I know:

First, let's note the matrix forms of the operators.

P_z matrix:
Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So P_z is a diagonal matrix because it's given in its eigenbasis. Hence, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ corresponding to the basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩ perhaps.

The state vector ψ is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of ψ corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate. So ψ can be written as a linear combination of |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩.

So |ψ⟩ = (-1/2)|1⟩ + (1/√2)|2⟩ + (-1/2)|3⟩.

To compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ⟨
