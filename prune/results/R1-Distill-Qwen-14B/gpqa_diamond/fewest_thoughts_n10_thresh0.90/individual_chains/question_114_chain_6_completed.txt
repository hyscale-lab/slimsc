Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with these reactions yet. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me look at each part carefully.

First Reaction:
Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide... Oh right! It's the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. So the mechanism involves the attack of the nucleophilic cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN-, but under what conditions does this happen?

I think the reaction requires an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide is a weak nucleophile in the presence of a base, right? So to make it a better nucleophile, it's usually done under acidic conditions. So, in the first step, A must be an acid. Looking at the options, A could be H3O+ (which is a strong acid) or NaHSO3 (which is a source of H+ and HSO3^-; but wait, NaHSO3 is a sodium bisulfite, which is more commonly used in other reactions like the reduction of aldehydes to alcohols.)

Wait, no. Wait, in the formation of cyanohydrins, the conditions are typically acidic. So the cyanide ion (from NaCN) acts as a nucleophile in an acid-catalyzed addition. So A should be an acid, like H3O+. Let me check the options.

Options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. So if the first part requires H3O+, then options A or B are possible.

Second Reaction:
2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, looking at this, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen? I think the typical way to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is hydrolysis. But what conditions are needed?

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, you might use HCl (H+ and Cl-) as the catalyst. Wait, but the reaction in the second part is in the presence of B and H2O. So B is the reagent.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the hydrolysis of nitriles. There are two main ways: hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. Acidic hydrolysis usually involves HCl, and it produces a carboxylic acid. Basic hydrolysis (like with H2O and NaOH) gives a carboxylate salt, which can then be acidified.

So in the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid. So what reagent B would cause the nitrile to hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid? If the reaction is done in aqueous HCl (acidic), then B would be HCl. Alternatively, if using a strong acid like H3O+, but in the options, reagent B is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Looking at the options, when B is HCl, that would fit. If B is HCl, then the second reaction uses HCl as the catalyst for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but what about the first part? The first reaction uses A, which, if we think, is H3O+ (so option A or B have A as H3O+). Then, in the second reaction, if B is HCl, then looking at options, option A has B as HCl.

Option A: A=H3O+ (which is correct for first reaction), B=HCl (correct for second reaction). So that would make sense.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Then option D is A=NaHSO3 and B=CH3COOH.

Wait, another thought: in the first reaction, could A be NaHSO3? Because NaHSO3 is a source of H+, but I'm not sure. Wait, when you have NaHSO3, it's HSO3^- when in solution. But in the context of the cyanohydrin formation, I think the acid is just to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So using H3O+ (like HCl or H2SO4) makes sense. NaHSO3 is more commonly used in other reactions, perhaps in the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols, but I don't think it's used for cyanohydrin formation.

So, focusing back: first reaction requires acid (H3O+), second reaction requires HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl. That fits both reactions.

Option B: A is H3O+, B is CH3COOH. Would CH3COOH work for the second reaction? Let's see. Acetic acid is a weak acid. For nitrile hydrolysis, I think a strong acid like HCl is needed, especially if you want to go directly to the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe under certain conditions, a weak acid could work, but I'm not sure. I think the standard is HCl for this.

So, option A seems correct.

Wait, but another point: in the second reaction, the reagent is B and it's in H2O. So the reagent B is added to the nitrile along with water, so the reaction is hydrolysis. So, what's the typical condition for acid-catalyzed nitrile hydrolysis? It's usually done in a strong acid, like HCl in water, under reflux.

So yes, B would be HCl.

So putting it together, A is H3O+ (for the first reaction), B is HCl (for the second). So the correct option is A.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B=HCl. Yes.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acidic medium to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the appropriate reagent for this purpose, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions. NaHSO₃ is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation, as it is more commonly associated with other reactions like carbonyl reductions.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This hydrolysis is typically carried out under acidic conditions, with HCl being the standard reagent for converting a nitrile directly into a carboxylic acid. While other acids like CH₃COOH (acetic acid) can sometimes be used, HCl is more effective and commonly employed for this transformation.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches both reactions: H₃O⁺ for the cyanohydrin formation and HCl for the nitrile hydrolysis.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is less suitable for the second reaction, as it is a weaker acid and not typically used for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not commonly used for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are incorrect for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
