Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the usual equations apply.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, n_i is the number of atoms in the excited state, n_j in the lower state. Since the problem compares the same energy levels between the two stars, the g_i and g_j (statistical weights) should be the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same transition in both. So the ratio for each star would be based on their respective temperatures.

Given that, the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, maybe the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

Each R is equal to (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference. Since ΔE is same for both stars, and g_i/g_j is same, the ratio R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, or is it exp( -ΔE/(k T) )? Since the equation is n_i/n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i > E_j, then n_i would be less than n_j, right? Because the exponential is negative. But in the question, it's the excited state that is more populated in star_1. Wait, wait, no. The excited state is higher, so in star_1, more atoms are in the excited state. So n_i (excited) for star_1 is twice that of star_2's n_i. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ratio R for star_1 is (n_i^1 / n_j^1) = 2*(n_i^2 / n_j^2) ). Because star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. Or am I getting the ratios wrong?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ratio for each star is (n_i)/(n_j). So for star_1, R1 = n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2) ) = 2 * R2.

But according to the Boltzmann factor, R = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), since E_i > E_j, so the exponent is negative. Wait, no: E_i is higher, so E_i - E_j is positive. So R = exp( -(
