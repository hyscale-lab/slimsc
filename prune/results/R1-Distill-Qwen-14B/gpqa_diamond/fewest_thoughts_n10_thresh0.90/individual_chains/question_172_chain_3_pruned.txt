Okay, so I've got this question about two stars and their iron atoms in the photosphere. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the visible layer of a star, right? And they're talking about the excitation of iron atoms in a specific energy level. Oh wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1.

Wait, what does that mean exactly? I think the excitation level refers to the population of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. So maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Oh, right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium, which is LTE here.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote that as ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Since star_1 has twice as excited atoms, maybe the population ratio (n1_high / n1_low) is twice that of star_2 (n2_high / n2_low). Wait, no, the question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps n1_high = 2 * n2_high? Or wait, perhaps n1_high / n1_low = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low) ? Because if the excitation is higher, more atoms are in the higher energy level relative to the lower one.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe the excitation in star_1 for that level is twice that of star_2. So maybe the ratio (n_high / n_low) for star_1 is twice that for star_2.

So star_1's ratio is R1 = 2 R2, where R2 is the ratio for star_2.

But wait, let's get back to the equation. For each star, the ratio is R1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) for star_1, and R2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) for star_2.

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars because it's the same element and same energy levels, so the g_i/g_j terms cancel out when taking the ratio R1/R2.

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k T1)) - (ΔE/(k T2)) ) )

Wait, because R1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 is exp( -ΔE/(k
