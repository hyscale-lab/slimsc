Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me start by understanding the question.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, I think that means that the number density of stars is the same everywhere. Uniform distribution implies no clustering or empty regions—stars are spread out evenly. 

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So, I need to find a relationship between the number of stars and the parallax. I remember that parallax is related to distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. The formula I recall is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, but how does this tie into the number of stars in a given parallax range? Hmm. Let me think about the geometry involved. If stars are uniformly distributed, then the number density (stars per cubic parsec) is constant. Let's denote this number density as n.

Now, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density n and the thickness dr. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd². So, the number of stars, dN, in that shell is n * 4πd² dr.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax. So I need to express this in terms of parallax (plx) instead of distance. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in.

So, dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dr). But I want to express this in terms of plx, not d. Hmm, because we're looking at a range of plx, which would correspond to a range in d. Let's find dr in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with absolute numbers, we can ignore the sign for now.

So substituting dr into dN: dN = n * 4π (1/plx²) * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ). Wait, that would give me dN = -4π n (1/plx^4) dplx. But since dN should be positive, perhaps I should take the absolute value or consider the range correctly. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express dN in terms of plx and dplx.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the number of stars per unit volume in terms of parallax. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me approach it differently.

If the number density is n stars per cubic parsec, then the number of stars in a small volume element dV is n dV.

But the volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = 4π d² dd, where d is the distance. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) is n * 4π d². 

Wait, but the question is about per unit parallax, not per unit distance. So I need to change variables from d to plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So substituting, the number of stars per unit distance is n *4π (1/plx)^2. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider how the number of stars in a certain range of plx changes. Suppose I have a small change in plx, dplx. The corresponding change in distance would be dd = (d^2 / (plx^2)) dplx? Wait, perhaps I should compute the differential.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to plx: dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is n * 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx, we have:

dN = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx )

Simplify that: dN = 4π n (1/plx^4) (-dplx). But since dN can't be negative, we can take the absolute value, so dN =4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but what we're looking for is stars per unit range of plx. So for a small dplx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that doesn't seem right because as plx increases (meaning closer stars), there should be more stars in a given plx interval. Wait, no, because higher plx means closer, so more stars in a small plx range near zero.

Wait, but the question is how the number per unit plx changes with plx. So perhaps the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But wait, that would mean that as plx increases (distance decreases), the number of stars per plx unit decreases. But that doesn't seem right because closer stars would have higher parallax and more stars would be found in a given small range of plx near zero. Wait, no, wait—wait, no, wait. Because the number of stars in a given dplx would depend on how the volume changes with plx.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of differential number per unit parallax. So the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But since dd is - (1/plx²) dplx, that gives dN = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's the same as option A, which is 1/plx^4. But I'm getting a bit confused because I might have messed up the substitution.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. There's a formula from astronomy that says the number of stars per unit volume in space is constant, so the number in a shell at distance d is proportional to d². Since the volume element of a shell is 4πd² dd.

But when we change to parallax, which is 1/d, the number of stars per unit plx would be proportional to (1/plx)^2 multiplied by the change in volume, which is proportional to (1/plx^2) dplx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the number per unit of plx. So if I have a thin slice in plx, the corresponding change in distance is dd = -d^2 dplx. So the volume of that slice is 4π d² dd. Substituting d =1/plx, then dd = -(1/plx^2) dplx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2 dplx) )=4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that slice is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Which would mean that the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but wait, that would imply that as plx increases (closer stars), the number per unit plx decreases. That doesn't make sense because in reality, there should be more stars in a given plx interval when the parallax is higher (closer stars) because density is the same. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a given volume is n * volume. The volume between plx and plx + dplx is a spherical shell of radius d = 1/plx,
