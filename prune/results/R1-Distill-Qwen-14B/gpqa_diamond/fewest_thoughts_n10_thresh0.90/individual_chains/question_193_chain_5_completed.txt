Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that parallax is related to distance.

Wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa. The formula I think is distance r = 1 / plx, but wait, no, the actual formula is r = 1 parsec / plx (in arcseconds). So plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to r.

The problem states that the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that.

1/(1/r)^5 is the same as r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmmm, I think I need to find how the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) changes. So maybe I should find dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r.

If N = k * r^5, where k is a constant, then the derivative dN/dr is 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) increases with r^4. So the correct answer should be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, let me double-check. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, and since plx ∝ 1/r, 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So that's the rate of change, which is the derivative. So dN/dr is 5 r^4, meaning the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4, which is option C.


The problem states that the number of stars \( N \) varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\( \text{plx} \propto \frac{1}{r} \)), substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the relation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, which corresponds to finding \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Differentiating \( N \propto r^5 \) yields \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

The correct answer is:

Answer: C
