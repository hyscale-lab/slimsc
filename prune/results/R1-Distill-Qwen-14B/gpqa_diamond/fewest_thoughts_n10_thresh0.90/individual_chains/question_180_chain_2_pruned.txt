Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again and try to figure it out. 

The question says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Wait, energy in this context—oh, right, it's the electric potential energy because we're dealing with charges. Since the system is isolated, the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, how are the charges arranged? Twelve are at a fixed distance from point P, which has the 13th charge. So the 13th is at P, fixed, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2m away from the 13th. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves?

Oh, I'm not told that they're fixed in any particular arrangement among themselves, but wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P. So maybe they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m around P. But then their mutual distances vary, but for the potential energy calculation, do I have to consider all their pairwise interactions? Because for a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

But wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. Hmm. Wait, I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by (k q1 q2)/r. Since all the 12 charges are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe the minimum energy occurs when they are as far apart as possible? Or wait, no, because if you bring them closer, the potential energy could be lower if they're opposite charges, but in this case, they're all positive or all negative? Wait, each charge is 2e. So if e is positive, then all are positive. So same sign, meaning repelling.

Wait, but when you have a bunch of positive charges, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. Because you have to do work against their mutual repulsion to bring them together. So, if the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P, but are free to move on that sphere, maybe their mutual potential energy will be minimized when they are as far apart from each other as possible on the sphere. But I'm not sure if I can assume that without more information. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies things by considering that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are all equal, but that might not be the case.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the potential energy comes from two contributions: the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but when considering the system's potential energy, it's the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs. So first, let's think about the contributions from the 13th charge to each of the 12.

Each of the 12 charges is 2m away from P, so the distance between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 is 2m. So for each of the 12, the potential energy due to the 13th charge is (k*(2e)*(2e))/ (2m). But wait, wait—the 13th charge is fixed at P, so each of the 12 is at 2m from it. So the potential energy between each pair is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). 

Wait, but for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy due to the 13th is (each 2e charge at distance 2m). So each of the 12 contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) to the total potential energy. Since there are 12 such pairs, that's 12 times that.

But wait, potential energy is a pairwise thing. Each pair is considered once. So between the 13th charge and each of the 12, that's 12 pairs.

Now the other part is the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. So each pair among the 12 contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between any two of the 12. But without knowing their mutual distances, it's tricky. But wait, the
