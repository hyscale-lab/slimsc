Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. I remember that e is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. But wait, each of these charges is 2e, so each one is 3.2 x 10^-19 C.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm. So point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electrostatic potential energy. So I need to calculate the potential energy of this configuration.

I recall that the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * |q1 * q2| / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, in a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. That makes sense because each pair contributes to the total energy.

So the system has 13 charges. One is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge.

But wait, the 12 charges are all fixed at 2m from P, but what about their distances from each other? Are they arranged in some way? Since the problem says the system is "isolated" and "the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P," I'm assuming that their positions are such that they are each 2 meters from P, but perhaps arranged symmetrically around P. However, the problem doesn't specify their mutual distances, which complicates things.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. That suggests that the configuration with the least potential energy is being considered. For like charges, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. But in this case, the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, so their mutual distances can't be changed beyond that. Uh, but wait, I might be overcomplicating.

Let me think: the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2m from P. So each of those 12 has a distance of 2m from the 13th. Now, between each of the 12 charges, what's the distance? Since they are all at the same distance from P, but it doesn't say they're arranged in a sphere or anything. So perhaps their mutual distances are variable, but since the problem asks for the minimum energy, I might have to assume that they are arranged in a way that the mutual potentials are minimized. Wait, no, because in the case of identical charges, arranging them as far apart
