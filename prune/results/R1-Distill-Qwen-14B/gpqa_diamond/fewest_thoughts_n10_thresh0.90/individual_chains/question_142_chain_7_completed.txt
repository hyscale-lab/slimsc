Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

The density matrix given is rho equals 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, wait, that's the same as 1/2(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. 

But what's the geometrical interpretation here? Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation, any single qubit state can be represented as a vector on or inside a unit sphere. The Bloch vector has components (x, y, z), and for a pure state, it's on the surface, while mixed states are inside.

Wait, so the density matrix rho is a mixed state because it's a convex combination of projectors onto |0> and |1>. Each term is a projector, and the coefficients are 1/2 each. So this is a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Because when you have equal probabilities for both |0> and |1>, it means the qubit is in a maximally mixed state.

In Bloch sphere terms, the maximally mixed state would be at the origin because it's equally likely to collapse to either state, so there's no preferred direction. That's because the Bloch vector is (0,0,0). Alternatively, the density matrix for the maximally mixed state is (I + 0·σ)/2, where σ is the Pauli matrices. Wait, I think the maximally mixed state is (I)/2, no, wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the identity matrix is I. So the maximally mixed state is I/2. Let me verify that. For a single qubit, the completely mixed state is indeed rho = I/2. So the density matrix given here is exactly I/2, because |0><0| + |1><1| is the same as I. Because |0> and |1> form an orthonormal basis, their projectors add up to the identity matrix. So rho = 1/2 * I.

So the density matrix is I/2. Now, how does this translate into the Bloch vector? The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if rho is I/2, that would imply that r·σ is zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So the Bloch vector r must be zero. Therefore, the point in the Bloch sphere is at the origin (0,0,0). 

But wait, looking back at the options: Option C is (0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1). Option A is (1,1,0), and D is (1,1,1). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. The density matrix in the question is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Since |0> and |1> are orthogonal, this simplifies to (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state. The maximally mixed state has no coherence and is in the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin. So yes, the position is (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the maximally mixed state corresponds to the origin, as there is no preferred direction and the qubit has equal probability of being in either state \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). 

The Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) of a density matrix is related to the general form of a single-qubit density matrix:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), it simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), which implies that the Bloch vector \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided:
- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state at the origin.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
