Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. The given density matrix here is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think I need to figure out where this matrix is located geometrically in the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state, the Bloch vector points from the origin to a point on the surface of the sphere. But for mixed states, it's inside the sphere. So, this ρ is a mixed state because it's a probabilistic mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

How do I find the Bloch vector for a given density matrix? Oh right, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ represents the Pauli matrices. So I need to express ρ in that form.

Let me write down ρ:

ρ = (1/2) (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| )

But wait, |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors. The identity matrix I for a qubit is |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|. So ρ is (1/2)(I). Because I is |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|, so (1/2)I would be (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ), which matches ρ.

So ρ = (I + 0·σ)/2. Because the coefficient of each Pauli matrix (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) is zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would mean the point is at the origin, which makes sense for a maximally mixed state.

Wait, but in the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is represented by the origin because it's equally probable in all directions. So the density matrix here represents a completely mixed qubit state, which is the maximally mixed state. Therefore, the Bloch vector should be all zeros.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is determined by expressing the density matrix in the form \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right) \), where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. 

For the given \( \rho \), it can be rewritten as \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} I \), which implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x \), \( \sigma_y \), and \( \sigma_z \) are all zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state, which is equally probable in all directions.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position of \( \rho \) in qubit space is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
