Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take a deep breath and start unpacking the problem.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration problem. The question is asking for the pH at two points: 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let's jot down the given data:

- We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02000 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. So the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated as concentration multiplied by volume. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So that's 0.05 M * 0.02000 L = 0.001 moles.

Then, we dilute this with 20.00 cm³ of water. Dilution will change the concentration. The total volume after dilution is 40.00 cm³ (0.04000 L). So the new concentration of acetic acid before titration is the initial moles divided by the new volume. That would be 0.001 moles / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.

Wait, but when we titrate with NaOH, the moles of NaOH added will react with the acetic acid. The reaction should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

The problem says it's a 25% titration. So 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. Let's compute how much NaOH is added.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react in a 1:1 ratio. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025.

But wait, how much volume of 0.1 M NaOH is that? Because the volume used in titration isn't provided directly. Oh, but the question only asks for the pH at specific points, not the volume. So maybe I don't need to calculate the volume right now.

Let's think about the 25% titration point. At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So the solution will be a buffer solution consisting of acetic acid and its conjugate base. For buffer solutions, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is applicable: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, but what's the pKa here? The given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is the negative logarithm of that. Let me compute that. Log(1.85e-
