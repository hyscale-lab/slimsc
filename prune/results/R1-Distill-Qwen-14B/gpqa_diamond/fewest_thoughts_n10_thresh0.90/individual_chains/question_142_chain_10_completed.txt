Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical mixture. 

Wait, what's the geometrical position in qubit space? Oh right, I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, any state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector, which has components (x, y, z). 

The general form for a density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh right, because for a pure state |ψ><ψ|, r is the Bloch vector of that state. But for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture, so the density matrix is a convex combination of projectors.

In this case, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So each term is a projector for the basis states |0> and |1>, each with weight 1/2. That sounds like a completely mixed state because it's equally likely to be in either state, regardless of measurement basis.

Wait, the completely mixed state in one qubit is the maximally mixed state, right? And that would correspond to r being 0 because it's (I)/2. Because when r is zero, ρ becomes (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which is the maximally mixed state. So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. The other options don't make sense because if r had non-zero components, the state would have some coherence or be a pure state. But here, the state is a completely mixed state with no coherences, so it's the center of the Bloch sphere.

Okay, so the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, as it is an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a quantum state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For a maximally mixed state, there are no coherences, and the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is zero. This corresponds to the state being at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** (\(r = (1,1,0)\)) and **Option D** (\(r = (1,1,1)\)) represent non-zero Bloch vectors, which would correspond to mixed or pure states with coherences, not a maximally mixed state.
- **Option B** (\(r = (0,0,1)\)) corresponds to a pure state with \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **Option C** (\(r = (0,0,0)\)) correctly represents the maximally mixed state, as it corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
