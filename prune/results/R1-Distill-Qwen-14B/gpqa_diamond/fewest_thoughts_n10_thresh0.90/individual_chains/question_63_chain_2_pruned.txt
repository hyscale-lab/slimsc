Okay, so I need to find out the momentum of a photon that can cause a diatomic molecule to switch from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is a non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, wait, wait, no, the question says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, so I guess it's considering both rotational and vibrational states.

Let me think about the energy states. In the quantum models, each state is characterized by quantum numbers. For the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is a rotation-vibration model, perhaps the energy includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the problem is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, that usually means the molecule is absorbing a photon that causes a transition to the next higher energy state, which could be in either vibration or rotation. But the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state... I think that's the ground state, so the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the first excited state.

Wait, in molecular energy levels, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So for a diatomic molecule, the next state could involve either increasing the vibrational quantum number (v) or the rotational quantum number (J). But which transition requires the least energy? Because the photon needs to have the correct energy to match the transition.

Alternatively, the question might be focusing on a vibrational transition only, but the model includes both. Hmm.

Wait, the problem is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, so the molecule's energy is a combination of both vibrational and rotational energies. But when considering transitions, typically the primary transition would be from the vibrational ground state to the first excited state, while the rotational state may change as well.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). To go to the next state, which is the next higher energy state, that would be the first excited state. But which transition requires the least energy? Because the photon's energy has to match that.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is h/(8π² I c), but I'm not sure. For the vibration, the energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency of vibration.

So the fundamental state is v=0 (so E_vib = (0 + 1/2) h w) and J=0 (so E_rot = 0). The next energy state would involve either increasing v to 1 or increasing J to 1.

The energy required for v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = h w. The energy required for J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = B*(1)(2) = 2B. Now, which is smaller? Because the photon's energy must match the transition.

Wait
