Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule's energy transition. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The molecule is made of elements X and Y. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

The given data are:
- Mass of X, Mx = 20 amu
- Mass of Y, My = 2 amu
- Bond length, R = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency, w = 4e14 rad/s

The options are A to D with different momentum values.

Wait, I think I should recall the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model. So, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next state would be either a vibrational transition (v=1, J=0) or a rotational transition (v=0, J=1). Since the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy," I think that refers to the next higher energy level, which would be either the first vibrational state or the first rotational state. But which one is lower in energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) h w. The rotational energy levels are Er = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. So, the energy gap between v=0, J=0 and v=0, J=1 would be the rotational transition, which is 2B (since Er for J=1 is 2B*2 = 2B? Wait no, J=0 is 0, J=1 is 2B, so the change is 2B). While the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 would be an energy change of h w. So, which is smaller, 2B or h w?

Because the photon's energy corresponds to the energy difference between states. So, the photon's momentum depends on its energy (since E = pc for a photon, because its mass is zero). So, if the photon's energy is delta E, then p = E / c.

So first, I need to calculate 2B and compare it to h w, to see which transition is lower in energy. The smaller delta E would correspond to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, but wait. When a molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state with the lowest energy is the one with the smallest possible delta E. So I need to find whether the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational state (v=0, J=1) is lower in energy.

So, calculate both delta E_vib and delta E_rot.

First, delta E_vib = h w.

Given w = 4e14 rad/s, so h w = 6.626e-34 J.s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, the rotational constant B is given by (h/(8 pi^2 c I)), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as B = h/(8 pi^2 I c), but I need to think about the exact formula.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are Er = B J (J + 1), where B = (h²)/(8 pi² I c²), or wait, I might be mixing up the definitions. Let me think again.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by Er = (ħ² J (J + 1)) / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, since I've heard that B = ħ²/(2 I), but I might be confusing with other constants.

Wait, no. The rotational constant B is defined as B = ħ²/(2 I), so Er = B J (J + 1).

But wait, I think I might be getting things wrong. Alternatively, the energy levels for rotation are sometimes written as Er = (J (J + 1) h c B) / (something). Hmm, maybe I should look up the formula, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it.

The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass and R is the bond length.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) amu, but I need to convert this to kg.

So, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg (let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.6605 is approx 3, so 3e-27 kg).

Then, I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So R = 2e-10 m. Thus I = (3e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg m².

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let's compute μ more accurately.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

So 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = (approx) 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27.

Let me calculate that: 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988, so 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 2.997e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² = (2.997e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². So I = 2.997e-27 *4e-20 = 1.1988e-46 kg m². Approximately 1.2e-46 kg m².

Now, B is the rotational constant, which is h/(8 pi² I c). Wait, is that correct? Or is it ħ²/(2 I). Let me think.

The rotational energy levels are given by Er = (ħ² J (J +1) )/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2 pi). So Er = ( (h/(2 pi))^2 J (J +1) )/(2 I) ) = (h² J (J+1))/(8 pi² I) ). So the energy levels are (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1). So the rotational constant in terms of energy is B = h²/(8 pi² I), but I think that's the same as the B used in the energy expression.

Wait, no, sometimes B is given in terms of cm^-1, which is energy per photon. Let me get back. Since we're dealing with the energy change, maybe it's easier to compute the energy gap for rotation.

For the rotational transition, the molecule goes from J=0 to J=1. The energy difference is Er = B (1)(2) - B (0)(1) ) = 2B. So delta E_rot = 2B.

So what is B?

B = h²/(8 pi² I c²) ? Wait, I think I might have confused the formula earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the rotational constant in terms of energy is given by B = (h²)/(8 pi² I c²) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, I think the rotational energy Er is (h^2 / (8 pi^2 I)) ) * (J (J+1) ) [units of J]. Let's proceed.

Compute B = h²/(8 pi² I). Plugging in the values:

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

I is 1.2e-46 kg m².

So,

B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 pi² * 1.2e-46 )

Calculate numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx (6.6e-34)^2 = approx 4.356e-67.

Denominator: 8 pi² *1.2e-46.

Compute 8 pi²: 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator = 78.9568 * 1.2e-46 = 94.748e-46 = 9.4748e-45.

So B = 4.356e-67 / 9.4748e-45 = approx 4.356e-67 / 9.47e-45 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, that's 4.6e-23 J? Then delta E_rot is 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier, the vibrational energy delta E_vib is about 2.65e-19 J. That's way bigger than 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition would require less energy than the vibrational transition. That would mean that the next state with the lowest possible energy is the first rotational state, not the first vibrational state.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is a change in the rotational state, and that would be a lower energy transition than the vibrational one. So the photon needed would have energy delta E_rot = 2B.

Wait, but wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, sometimes the states are considered as combinations of rotational and vibrational. But the transition would involve changes in both rotational and vibrational states, perhaps?

No, no, in this question, the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Since the energy required for the rotational transition is lower, that photon would have lower energy, so that would be the next state.

So the energy difference is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, The formula for B is (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I c^2). Wait, is there a c in the denominator? Because another version of rotational energy has factors involving the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should use the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers. But maybe I should approach it differently. Let me recall that the rotational constant B is also given by B = h/(8 pi^2 c I), where c is the speed of light. Wait, I'm not sure, but perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: the moment of inertia I is μ R². The rotational energy levels are given by Er = (ħ²/(2 I)) J (J +1), where ħ is h/(2 pi). So Er = (h²/(8 pi² I)) J (J +1). So the energy levels are in terms of Joules.

So, for J=0, Er=0. J=1, Er = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * 2. So delta E_rot is 2 * (h²/(8 pi² I)).

Wait, but I think the actual formula for B is B = h c / (8 pi^2 I), where the energy is expressed per photon in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1). Wait, maybe I'm mixing frequency with wavenumbers. Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is expressed in terms of wavenumbers as B = h c/(8 pi² I).

Wait, alternatively, the rotational constant is often expressed as B = h/(8 pi² c I), which would have units of 1/m (wavenumbers), but when multiplied by c (speed of light), it gives energy in J.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to compute B correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can find B using the formula B = h²/(8 pi² I c²). No, I'm not confident. Another approach: let's find the rotational constant in terms of energy.

The rotational energy for a given J is Er = (J (J + 1) h c B ) where B is in cm^-1. Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, B is often expressed in cm^-1, and the energy is E = h c B.

But perhaps in this problem, it's easier to compute the energy difference in terms of J.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the given vibrational angular frequency. Wait, but that's for the vibration part, not the rotation.

Let me go back.

Compute B = h²/(8 pi² I c²) ?

Wait, another approach: the rotational partition function is given by q_rot = (sqrt( (pi I k T)/(2 h^2)} )) * (something), but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational constant B is given by B = h/(8 pi^2 I c), but the units need to check out.

Wait, let's compute B as h²/(8 pi² I c²), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of the moment of inertia and the speed of light. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the rotational energy levels in terms of the rotational constant B, where B is given in cm^-1. So B = h c/(8 pi² I), where I is in kg m², and c is in m/s.

Yes, that sounds right. Because then B (cm^-1) would be (h c) / (8 pi^2 I) ), and I can compute that.

So, B = h c / (8 pi^2 I).

Given:

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

I = 1.2e-46 kg m².

So,

B = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) / (8 pi² * 1.2e-46 kg m² )

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 8 * pi^2 * 1.2e-46.

Compute 8 pi^2 = 8 *9.8696≈78.957.

So denominator =78.957 *1.2e-46 = 94.748e-46 = 9.4748e-45 kg m².

Wait, but denominator is 8 pi^2 I, which is 8 pi^2 * 1.2e-46 kg m². So:

B = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (9.4748e-45 kg m²) )

But J is kg m²/s², so J m = kg m³/s². Denominator is kg m².

So units: [kg m^3/s² ] / [ kg m² ] = m/s² * m = m²/s²? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, J = kg m²/s². So J m = kg m^3/s².

Denominator is kg m². So the units of B would be (kg m^3/s²) / (kg m²) ) = m/s². That doesn't make sense for a wavenumber. So I think I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is B = h/(8 pi^2 c I), which would have units of 1/s. Because h has units of J s, c is m/s, I is kg m².

So B = (J s) / ( (m/s) * kg m² ) )

J = kg m²/s².

So B = (kg m²/s² * s) ) / ( (m/s) * kg m² )

Simplify numerator: kg m²/s.

Denominator: (m/s) * kg m² = kg m^3/s.

So units of B = (kg m²/s) ) / (kg m^3/s ) ) = 1/m, which is wavenumbers. That makes sense.

So B = h/(8 pi^2 c I )

Compute that:

h =6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

I=1.2e-46 kg m².

So,

B = 6.626e-34 / (8 pi^2 *3e8 *1.2e-46 )

Compute denominator: 8 pi² ≈78.957; 78.957 *3e8 = 2.3687e10.

Then 2.3687e10 *1.2e-46 = 2.8424e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 / 2.8424e-36 = approx 2330.3 s^-1.

Wait, but B is in wavenumbers (cm^-1) if I'm calculating it correctly. Wait, wait, no. Because the formula gives B in 1/m, which is inverse meters. To convert to cm^-1, we multiply by 100, because 1 m =100 cm, so 1/m = 1/(100 cm) ) = 0.01 cm^-1.

So B in cm^-1 is 2330.3 * 0.01 =23.303 cm^-1.

Wait, but that's B in cm^-1. So the energy for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is delta E = h c B (1 -> 2) ? Because Er = B J (J+1) h c.

Wait, no. Alternatively, each rotational level is at energy E = h c B J (J+1). So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= 2 h c B.

So delta E_rot = 2 h c B. But wait, wait, let me think.

Alternatively, the energy levels are given by E_J = h c B J (J +1). So from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = h c B (1*2 -0 )= 2 h c B.

So delta E_rot = 2 h c B.

But wait, B is already in cm^-1, so h c B would be in Joules.

Because h c B = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) * (23.303 cm^-1). Wait, wait, 23.303 cm^-1 is 23.303 * (1/m) * (1/100 m) )? No, wait, cm^-1 is 1/(cm), so 23.303 cm^-1 is 23.303 * (1/0.01 m) ) = 23.303 * 100 m^-1. Wait, no: 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 cm^-1 = 100 m^-1. So 23.303 cm^-1 = 2330.3 m^-1.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute B in m^-1 and then compute E_rot.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute delta E_rot.

delta E_rot = 2 h c B.

But from earlier, B = 2330.3 m^-1.

So delta E_rot = 2 * 6.626e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s * 2330.3 m^-1.

Compute:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Multiply by 2330.3 m^-1:

1.9878e-25 J m * 2330.3 m^-1 = 1.9878e-25 * 2330.3 ≈ 4.616e-22 J.

Then multiply by 2:

delta E_rot = 2 *4.616e-22 = 9.232e-22 J.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated delta E_vib, it was 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match delta E_rot, which is 9.23e-22 J.

But wait, no, earlier I thought delta E_rot was 9.2e-23 J. Now it's 9.2e-22 J. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute B. I think the mistake is in the formula. Let's go back:

B = h/(8 pi^2 c I )

h =6.626e-34 J s.

c =3e8 m/s.

I=1.2e-46 kg m².

So,

B =6.626e-34 / (8 * pi^2 *3e8 *1.2e-46 )

Compute denominator:

8 * pi^2 ≈78.957.

78.957 *3e8 = 2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.2e-46 = 2.8424e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 / 2.8424e-36 = approximately 2330.3 s^-1.

Wait, but that gives B in s^-1, which is angular frequency. But earlier I thought B is in cm^-1. Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the rotational constant in terms of energy is B = h^2/(8 pi^2 I c^2). Let me try that.

B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 pi^2 *1.2e-46 * (3e8)^2 )

Compute denominator: (3e8)^2 =9e16.

8 pi^2 ≈78.957.

78.957 *1.2e-46 =9.4748e-45.

Multiply by 9e16: 9.4748e-45 *9e16 = 8.5273e-28.

So denominator is 8.5273e-28.

Numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.390e-67.

So B =4.390e-67 /8.5273e-28 ≈5.147e-40 J.

Wait, that's way too small. So delta E_rot would be 2 *5.147e-40 =1.029e-39 J. That's much smaller than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but that can't be right because I'm getting a much smaller delta E_rot than the vibrational delta E. But earlier I thought the rotational delta E was higher than the vibrational, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should use the bond length in meters, which I did. The moment of inertia is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant in terms of energy per transition.

Wait, the vibrational transition is from v=0 to v=1: delta E_vib = h w.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So delta E_vib =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

The rotational transition from J=0 to J=1: delta E_rot = 2B.

But what is B in terms of energy?

B is the rotational constant in terms of energy, so B = h c B_wavenumber, where B_wavenumber is in cm^-1.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate B_wavenumber = h/(8 pi^2 c I), which would be in m^-1, and then convert to cm^-1 by dividing by 100.

Alternatively, let me compute B_wavenumber:

B_wavenumber = (h)/(8 pi^2 c I) )

h=6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

I=1.2e-46 kg m².

Plugging in:

B_wavenumber =6.626e-34 / (8 pi² *3e8 *1.2e-46 )

Denominator: 8 pi² ≈78.957; 78.957 *3e8=2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.2e-46 =2.8424e-36.

So B_wavenumber=6.626e-34 / 2.8424e-36 ≈ 2330.3 m^-1.

Convert to cm^-1: 2330.3 m^-1 =2330.3 /100 cm^-1 =23.303 cm^-1.

So the energy for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is delta E_rot = h c B_wavenumber * (J=1 (J=1 +1) - J=0 (J=0 +1) ) ).

Wait, no. The energy for each rotational level is E_J = h c B_wavenumber J (J+1).

So from J=0 to J=1, the change is E_1 - E_0 = h c B_wavenumber (1*2 -0) )= 2 h c B_wavenumber.

So delta E_rot =2 h c B_wavenumber.

Plugging in the numbers:

h=6.626e-34 J s,

c=3e8 m/s,

B_wavenumber=23.303 cm^-1 =2330.3 m^-1.

So,

delta E_rot=2 *6.626e-34 *3e8 *2330.3.

Compute step by step:

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J m.

Multiply by 2330.3 m^-1: 1.9878e-25 *2330.3 = approx 4.616e-22 J.

Multiply by 2: delta E_rot=9.232e-22 J.

Comparing to delta E_vib=2.65e-19 J. So delta E_rot is much smaller than delta E_vib.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the J=1 rotational state, requiring a photon with energy 9.232e-22 J.

Now, the photon's energy E is related to momentum p by E = pc, since for photons, E = pc.

So, p = E / c.

So,

p =9.232e-22 J /3e8 m/s =3.077e-30 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 3.077e-30 kg m/s. But none of the options match this. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of delta E_rot.

delta E_rot =2 * h c B_wavenumber.

h=6.626e-34 J s,

c=3e8 m/s,

B_wavenumber=23.303 cm^-1 =2330.3 m^-1.

Wait, no, 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1, so 23.303 cm^-1 is 23.303 *100 m^-1 =2330.3 m^-1.

So,

h c B_wavenumber =6.626e-34 *3e8 *2330.3.

Compute 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J m.

Multiply by 2330.3 m^-1: 1.9878e-25 *2330.3 = approx 4.616e-22 J.

Multiply by 2: 9.232e-22 J.

So p = E/c =9.232e-22 J /3e8 m/s =3.077e-30 kg m/s.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to
