Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but I'll try to remember.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Oh wait, 8.5 minutes is about the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if something happens in the Sun's core, we on Earth feel the effects almost immediately, right? That makes sense because neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light.

So, the pp-III chain is part of the proton-proton cycle in the Sun's core. I remember that the pp chains are the main sources of solar energy. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, but there are others like pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, the pp-III branch must produce neutrinos as part of its process. So stopping pp-III would mean fewer neutrinos from that chain.

The question is about the flux ratio between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what determines the neutrino energy distribution?

I think in the Sun, the dominant neutrino source is the decay of boron-8 (B-8), which is produced in the pp-III chain. B-8 has a half-life of about 76 minutes and decays into lithium-7 and two positrons, releasing a beta-plus. But wait, neutrinos are emitted in the decay of B-8, specifically electron neutrinos. So, if the pp-III branch stops, then B-8 production stops. But wait, the question says other reactions remain as they were. So, maybe other neutrino sources are still active.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces B-8, which then decays. If I stop pp-III, I can't produce any more B-8. But since B-8 has a half-life of about 76 minutes, there's still some B-8 left in the Sun's core after 8.5 minutes because it takes time for the isotope to decay. However, the production has stopped, so the amount of B-8 is decreasing. But how does that affect the neutrino flux now?

The neutrinos from B-8 decay are in the energy range around 1.5 MeV, right? Because the decay involves a positron, so the neutrino energy is about that. So, the neutrinos from B-8 are higher energy than the bands we're considering. Wait, the bands are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So our B-8 neutrinos are higher, around 1.5 MeV, so they don't fall into these lower bands. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about neutrinos from the other branches. Wait, the pp-I branch produces deuterium, which eventually leads to helium-4, but doesn't produce as many neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III are other branches. Oh, wait, the main neutrino source in the Sun is from B-8 decay in the pp-III chain. But perhaps the pp-I and pp-II produce neutrinos too. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the question is about the neutrinos from the other end of the chain. Like, the electron neutrinos from the CNO cycle. But I think the CNO cycle produces more high-energy neutrinos as well. So I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, another approach: the pp-III chain produces B-8, which then decays into 7Be and emits a neutrino. The decay of 7Be also produces neutrinos when it captures an electron. But wait, 7Be is produced in the pp-III chain as well. So if pp-III stops, the production of 7Be stops. But 7Be has a half-life of about 53 days. So in 8.5 minutes, the 7Be would have just started decaying, but there's still a lot around, right? So the neutrinos from 7Be would still be present.

Wait, but if the pp-III chain stops, then the production of 7Be stops. But 7Be has a longer half-life, so the amount present would decrease over time. But 8.5 minutes is nothing compared to 53 days, so the amount of 7Be hasn't decreased much yet. So the neutrinos from 7Be would still be about the same as before, but the production has stopped. So, the 7Be would continue to emit neutrinos as it decays, but without new production. So, the neutrino flux from 7Be would decrease over time, but in the short term (like 8.5 minutes), the flux from 7Be is almost the same as before.

Wait, but the question is about neutrino energies in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV ranges. Let me think about what neutrinos are in those energy ranges.

I remember that the B-8 neutrinos are around 1.5 MeV. The 7Be neutrinos from the decay of 7Be (which is in the pp-III chain) are about 0.47 MeV. So they are lower in energy. But the bands in the question are 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. So both of these bands are in the range of 0.8 MeV, which is lower than 7Be's neutrinos. Wait, no, 7Be's
