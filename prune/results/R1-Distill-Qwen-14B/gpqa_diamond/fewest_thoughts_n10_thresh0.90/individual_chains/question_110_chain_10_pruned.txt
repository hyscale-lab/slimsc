Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably understand what the question is asking. It says which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. The question gives each star's RA, DEC, magnitude, distance, and sometimes extinction (like E(B-V)). So I need to see for each star whether it's bright enough to be seen by both instruments.

Wait, the user provided some info. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the text says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Wait, but brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's apparent V mag is brighter than 17, meaning it's less than 17, right? Because lower magnitudes mean brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars where V <17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the star's apparent V mag must be less than 16.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Because the way it's worded: "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its apparent magnitude is lower (since apparent magnitude scale is inverse). So for ESPRESSO, V <17. Similarly, for HIRES, it's V <16.

Wait, but wait, I think sometimes when people say "brighter than X mag", it's a bit ambiguous. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So for a star to be detected, its V must be less than the given magnitude. So for ESPRESSO, V < 17. For HIRES, V <16.

So each star's apparent V magnitude needs to be less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (for HIRES). So a star must have V <16 to be detected by both.

Wait, no. Because the question says which stars can be detected with both. So each star must be detectable by both spectrographs. So each star
