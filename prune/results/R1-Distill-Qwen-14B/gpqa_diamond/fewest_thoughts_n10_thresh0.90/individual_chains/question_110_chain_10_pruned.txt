Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think.

First, I remember that both telescopes use spectrographs, and the key here is their brightness as observed in the V band, which is related to apparent magnitude. The question gives some thresholds: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can go down to 16 mag. So the stars need to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no, actually, wait. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Brighter means lower apparent magnitude. Oh right, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag, meaning any star with V mag <=17 is observable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag <=16. So a star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the wording: "brighter than 17 mag". Wait, stars are brighter when their magnitude is lower. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, its apparent magnitude must be less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, the apparent V mag must be less than 17. For HIRES, it's less than 16. So the star needs to have apparent V mag less than 16, because it must be detectable by both. Because if it's more than 16 mag, HIRES can't see it. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So apparent magnitude less than 17. And HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, meaning apparent magnitude less than 16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V mag less than 16. So any star with V mag <=16 can be seen by both. Because HIRES can't see anything fainter than 16, so the star must
