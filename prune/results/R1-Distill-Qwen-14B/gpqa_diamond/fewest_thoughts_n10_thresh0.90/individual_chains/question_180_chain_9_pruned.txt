Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energy, we're usually looking at the electric potential energy between them. Since the system is isolated, the energy should be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th one. Also, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but what about their distances from each other? Are they arranged symmetrically around point P?

Assuming that the 12 are arranged in a way that they're each 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances would vary depending on the geometry. But if they're all at the same distance from P, perhaps in a spherical shell or something, but I'm not entirely sure if that's necessary for this problem.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So I think the setup would place all the 12 charges as close as possible to each other because that would minimize the potential energy. Wait, no, wait. Wait a secondâ€”electric potential energy between two point charges is given by U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. But since the charges are all positive (because each is 2e, and e is the elementary charge which is positive), bringing them closer together would actually increase the potential energy because each pair contributes a positive amount. So maybe I'm thinking about it wrong.

Wait no, no. Because for like charges, the potential energy is positive. So if they're all as close as possible, the potential energy would be higher. So to minimize the energy, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each pair is as far apart as possible, but since they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, their mutual distances would depend on that.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is simplifying things by considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge at P, and ignoring the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the entire system, which includes all interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are maximized, but I'm not sure how to model that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 12 charges and the 13th one. Let me think: If the 13th charge is at point P, and each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P, then each of the 12 has a charge of 2e, and the 13th also has 2e. So the potential energy due to each pair between P and the 12 charges is U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 meters).

Wait, but wait. Each of the 12 charges is a distance of 2 meters from P, so each contributes an individual potential energy. Since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy from those interactions would be 12 times the energy between one charge and the central one.

But wait, in reality, when calculating the total potential energy, we have to consider all possible pairs. But in this case, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy from the 12 charges with the central one, because the other interactions between the 12 charges may not be possible due to their fixed
