Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with bromine, it's usually an addition reaction. But wait, this compound is an enol, right? Enols are related to ketones and aldehydes. So maybe the reaction isn't just a simple bromine addition.

Wait, cyclopent-1-enol... Oh right, enols have an adjacent double bond and an alcohol group. So the structure must be a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and an -OH group on carbon 1 as well. But wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think. The IUPAC name is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the hydroxyl group is on C1. Also, there are two methyl groups on C4.

So the structure would be a cyclopentane ring. Positions 1 and 2 are double-bonded, so a cyclopentene ring. At position 1, there's an -OH group. And at position 4, two methyl groups.

When bromine (Br2) reacts with an alkene, it typically adds across the double bond. But wait, enols can undergo different types of reactions. Oh, right! Enols can react with electrophiles. Since the enol has a conjugated double bond adjacent to an -OH group, the alpha carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl or in this case, the oxygen) would be sites for electrophilic attack.

Wait, but wait a secondâ€”the enol form is an acid. It can tautomerize to the keto form, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dihydroxylation? No, that's with something like OsO4. Bromine in a different solvent might do something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's an addition reaction. Let me think about the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1. So the structure is: cyclopentane ring with double bond C1-C2, OH on C1, and two methyl groups on C4.

Wait, would the Br add to the double bond? If it's an addition reaction, then it's a diaddition, so each Br would add to adjacent carbons. But wait, the enol has a conjugated double bond with an -OH. If Br2 adds, it would add across the double bond.

But wait, maybe the enol can also undergo a conjugate addition? Or is it an electrophilic attack at the alpha position? Because the enol has an oxygen which can stabilize a positive charge. So perhaps the Br adds to the alpha carbon (the one next to the oxygen).

Let me think about the mechanism. Enols are nucleophilic at the alpha position because the lone pair on the oxygen can conjugate with the double bond, making the alpha carbons more electrophilic? Wait, no, wait. The enol has a conjugated double bond, so the lone pair on oxygen can delocalize into the double bond, making the adjacent carbons more electron-deficient, hence more susceptible to electrophilic attack.

Wait, another thought: when an enol reacts with an electrophile like bromine, it might undergo a conjugate addition or perhaps a substitution. Alternatively, the Br could add across the double bond, but in a conjugated system, the addition could be either 1,2 or 1,4.

Wait, wait. Let me think of another possibility. Bromine in a non-polar solvent, like CCl4, would typically add to the double bond in a dibromide. So the double bond (C1-C2) would take two Brs, one on each carbon.

But wait, in the presence of an enol, perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe the enol's conjugated system makes the double bond less reactive, or maybe it's more reactive. Alternatively, the enol could act as a reducing agent, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, I've heard about the acid-catalyzed hydration of alkynes, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure again. 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the ring is cyclopentane, with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH on C1, and two methyl groups on C4. So the structure is:

Positions 1 (OH), 2 (double bond to 1), 3, 4 (two methyls), and 5. So the ring is:

1-OH, double bond to 2, then 3, 4 with two methyls, and 5 connected back to 1.

So the ring looks like: 1 (OH) connected to 2 (double bond) and 5. 2 connected to 3. 3 connected to 4 (which has two methyl groups) and 2. 4 connected to 5 and another methyl. 5 connected to 1 and 4.

Wait, no. Cyclopentane is a five-membered ring. So positions 1 is connected to 2 and 5. Position 2 is connected to 1, 3, and a double bond to 1. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled up in the structure.

Let me try to imagine it. So the cyclopentene ring with the double bond at C1-C2. The OH is on C1. So, the ring is 1 (OH), 2 (double bond to 1), 3, 4 (with two methyl groups), and 5.

So in terms of the double bond, the ring is not conjugated beyond the double bond, except for the OH. Wait, perhaps the enol is in a conjugated system with the double bond and the OH.

So when Br2 is added, it would add across the double bond. So the double bond between C1 and C2 would open, and each carbon would get a Br.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. But looking at the options:

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

So those are possible. But wait, is that the only possibility?

Alternatively, perhaps there's an acid-catalyzed mechanism. Wait, but the question doesn't mention any conditions, so it's just bromine. So probably, the bromine adds across the double bond in a trans fashion, leading to vicinal dibromide.

Wait, but the enol can tautomerize. So the enol and keto forms are in equilibrium. So the reaction could proceed through either. But if the enol is the major form, then the addition would occur where?

Wait, maybe the addition of Br2 to the enol would lead to a different product. Alternatively, maybe the enol can form a cyclic bromonium ion, leading to a different regiochemistry. Hmm, but I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not an addition but an oxidation. Wait, bromine can act as an oxidizing agent in certain conditions. For example, in the presence of an acid, bromine can oxidize alcohols. But wait, our starting material is an enol, which is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, let me think. In acidic conditions, enols are more stabilized, so maybe the reaction is different. But the question doesn't specify the reaction conditions, so perhaps it's a simple addition.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a bromoketone. Wait, but 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone would form if the enol is converted to a ketone. Then, bromine might add to the carbonyl group, but that's not typical.

Wait, no, adding bromine to a carbonyl is more like a nucleophilic addition, but carbonyl groups are usually attacked by nucleophiles, not electrophiles. Wait, but bromine in some conditions can add to carbonyl groups as well, but that's more like the dibromide addition. Hmm, but that's for ketones, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol reacts with Br2 in a way that the Br adds to the alpha carbon, adjacent to the OH group. So perhaps the OH group is deprotonated, making the alpha carbon more electrophilic, and Br adds there.

Wait, but in the absence of a base, would that happen? Because the enol has an acidic alpha proton (because of the adjacent oxygen). So maybe in the presence of Br2, the alpha proton could be abstracted, forming an enolate, which then reacts with Br.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, bromine could act as an electrophile, and the enol's alpha position could attack it.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br adds to the double bond, making a vicinal dibromide, but with the stereochemistry determined by the addition.

Wait, when Br2 adds to a double bond, it's typically an anti addition. So if the starting material is a cyclopentene with substituents on either side, the Brs would add on opposite sides, leading to a trans-dibromide.

But looking at the options, options A and D are 1,2-dibromo with different configurations. So the product would have Br on C1 and C2.

Then, the next thought is about the stereochemistry. The starting compound is a cyclopentene, so when Br2 adds, the Brs would add across the double bond in a trans fashion. So if the cyclopentene was in a certain conformation, the Brs would end up in a specific configuration.

Wait, but the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the substituents on C4 are two methyl groups. I'm trying to imagine the structure. Let's number the ring: positions 1 (OH), 2 (double bond to 1), 3, 4 (two methyls), and 5.

So when Br2 adds, the Brs would go to C1 and C2, which are adjacent. The addition would be trans. So the Br on C1 would be on the opposite side to the Br on C2.

But the starting material itself has substituents. The OH is on C1, and the two methyl groups are on C4. So when the Brs add to C1 and C2, the substituents (OH and methyl) would influence the configuration.

Wait, but let me think about the possible stereochemistry. The product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. The possible configurations are whether the Brs are on the same face or opposite.

In a typical bromine addition, the Brs add with anti stereochemistry. So if the double bond was in a certain way, the Brs would end up trans.

But in the case of a cyclic system, perhaps the stereochemistry becomes a bit more complex. For example, in a cyclohexene, the addition of bromine would lead to a trans-dibromide because of the ring's structure.

Wait, but cyclopentene is a five-membered ring with a double bond. Adding Br2 would form a 1,2-dibromocyclopentane with the two Brs on opposite sides.

So in this case, the product would have Brs on C1 and C2, each in opposite configurations. So the molecule would have a specific stereoisomer.

Looking at the options, options A and D are the 1,2-dibromo with different configurations.

Option A: (1R,2S)

Option D: (1R,2R)

Wait, but how would the configuration be determined? Let's imagine the starting material.

The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The structure would have the OH on C1, and the double bond between C1 and C2. The methyl groups are on C4, which is two carbons away from C1 in the ring.

If I imagine the cyclopentene ring, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, when Br2 adds, the Brs would add to C1 and C2 with anti stereochemistry. So, the Br on C1 would be opposite to the Br on C2.

But wait, the OH is on C1. So when adding Br to C1, the Br would be on the opposite face of the OH group. Let's say the OH is in the axial position (if the ring is chair-like, but cyclopentane isn't a chair). Alternatively, perhaps the ring adopts a certain conformation.

Wait, perhaps using the Newman projection would help. Let me think: when looking along the C1-C2 bond, the Brs would add from opposite directions. So, if the OH is on the front side of C1, the Br would add from the back side, and the Br on C2 would add from the front side? No, wait, because the addition is anti, so for each carbon, the Br adds from the opposite side.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the two Brs add from opposite faces, leading to a trans configuration.

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, the addition of Br2 would lead to a diepoxide, but that's not the case here. Hmm, maybe I should think about the specific options.

Option A is (1R,2S), and option D is (1R,2R). So, whether the two Brs are on the same or opposite sides.

If the addition is anti, then the Br on C1 would be on the opposite face to the Br on C2. So, their configurations would be opposite. So the product would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R), depending on the starting structure.

But wait, the starting material's configuration isn't specified. Do I need to determine the configuration of the starting enol?

Wait, no. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The enol form suggests that the structure is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. Now, the enol can have cis or trans stereochemistry, but without any specific information, I'm assuming the enol is in its most stable form, which is typically the cis-diol or the less substituted position, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of the enol with bromine doesn't involve the double bond but rather the alpha position. Wait, but the enol's structure is such that the double bond is conjugated with the OH group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach. Let's consider each option.

Option B and C are about bromo-ketones. Wait, the starting material is an enol, which can tautomerize to a ketone. So, maybe the reaction is not with the enol but with the keto form.

If the enol is converted to a ketone (cyclopentanone with substituents), then adding bromine might either add to the carbonyl group or to the ring.

But wait, in the presence of a ketone, bromine would typically add to the carbonyl group in a conjugate addition, but more likely, it would add to the alpha position. Or perhaps it would undergo some kind of electrophilic addition.

Wait, but if the enol is in equilibrium with the ketone, maybe the reaction occurs on the ketone. So 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone would be the keto form. Then, bromine would add to the carbonyl group. But wait, adding bromine to a ketone... I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Br could add to the alpha position of the ketone.

Wait, let me think. In the keto form, the alpha carbons are C2 and C5 (since the ketone is on C1). So adding Br to C2 or C5.

If bromine adds to the alpha position (say, C2), then the product would be 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. That's option B.

Alternatively, if it adds to C3, but that's not possible because it's not an alpha position.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is the enol, which has the OH on C1 and a double bond between C1 and C2. The keto form would have a carbonyl on C1 and a single bond between C1 and C2.

So in the keto form, the alpha carbons are C2 and C5. So bromine could add to either of those positions.

But why would bromine add to the alpha position? Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, making the alpha positions more electron-deficient, hence susceptible to electrophilic attack.

So, if the Br adds to the alpha carbon (C2, adjacent to the carbonyl), then the product would be 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, which is option B.

But wait, would that be the case? Because in the enol form, the double bond is conjugated with the OH group, making the adjacent carbon (C2) more electron-rich or deficient?

Wait, in the enol form, the lone pair on the oxygen can conjugate with the double bond, making the alpha carbon (C2) more electrophilic. So if Br2 is present, perhaps the Br would attack the C2.

But wait, Br2 is a di-electrophile. Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. Or maybe the enol acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, but the enol has a double bond, so maybe it's more about addition to the double bond. So back to the original thought: adding Br2 to the double bond would give a 1,2-dibromide.

So looking back at the options, option A and D are dibromides with different configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bromoketone, which would be option B. But I'm a bit confused.

Let me think about the possible mechanisms again. If the enol reacts with Br2, what would happen?

Enol has a double bond adjacent to an -OH group. The double bond can react with Br2 via addition. So the Brs add across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide, which would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

But the product would have two Brs on adjacent carbons, with the OH on C1.

But the options A and D are such products. So why would there be two stereoisomers?

Wait, because the addition of Br2 to a double bond can lead to either a cis or trans dibromide, depending on the structure.

But wait, in a cyclic system like cyclopentene, the addition of Br2 would lead to a trans-dibromide because of the ring's constraint. So the Brs would end up on opposite sides.

So the product would have the Brs on opposite faces, leading to (1R,2S) or (1S,2R) configuration.

Looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), option D is (1R,2R).

So which one is correct? Without the exact starting structure, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps the configuration depends on the starting material's stereochemistry.

Wait, but the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Let me imagine the structure. The OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. The methyl groups are on C4.

So the ring would have the substituents as such: C1 has OH, C2 is part of the double bond, C4 has two methyl groups.

When Br2 adds across the double bond, the Brs will add in a trans fashion. So, if the starting double bond is in a certain configuration, the Brs will end up trans.

Wait, but the starting double bond's configuration isn't specified. The question just gives the name as cyclopent-1-enol, so it's a trans or cis double bond? Wait, no. When the name is given without any stereo indicators, it's considered as the most stable structure, which is trans in some cases, but for alkenes, it's typically the least substituted unless otherwise specified.

Wait, no, for cyclopentene, the most stable form is the cis because the ring strain is minimized. Wait, actually, in small rings like cyclopentene, the double bond tends to be less strained in a cis configuration because it allows the substituents to be on the same side, reducing angle strain. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting double bond isn't relevant here because the bromine addition is stereospecific. So regardless of the starting configuration, the product would have anti addition.

But without knowing the starting stereochemistry, perhaps the product would have a specific configuration. But the options A and D are enantiomers.

Hmm, perhaps the product isn't a dibromide but a mono-bromide. Wait, how?

Wait, another possibility: the enol could undergo an electrophilic attack at the alpha position, leading to the addition of Br at C2 (the alpha position), resulting in a bromide at that position without affecting the double bond.

Wait, but then the double bond would remain, but that doesn't seem to match any of the options. The options either have Brs added across the ring or at a specific position.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol reacts with Br2 in a way where the OH group is involved. Wait, the OH could potentially form a bromohydrin, but that usually involves an epoxide or a different setup.

Alternatively, maybe the OH group is oxidized. But in the presence of bromine, oxidation might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation. No, dihydroxylation uses OsO4, not Br2.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think again.

If the enol reacts with Br2, the most straightforward reaction is addition across the double bond, giving a 1,2-dibromide. That would produce one of the options A or D.

But why would the stereochemistry be R and S, or both R?

Wait, perhaps the addition of Br2 leads to a specific configuration based on the enol's structure. Let's imagine the enol is in a certain conformation when the Br adds.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is based on the stability of the transition state. The addition of Br2 can have a preference for certain stereochemistry.

Wait, but I don't know enough about that. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bromoketone, which would be option B or C.

Wait, 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone is the keto form. So, adding Br to the alpha position (C2) would yield 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (option B). Alternatively, adding Br to C3 would give 3-bromo, which isn't one of the options.

But why would Br add to the alpha position of the keto form? Because the keto form is in equilibrium with the enol. So when Br2 is added, perhaps it reacts more with the keto form.

So, if the enol is in equilibrium with the keto form, and the reaction is with the keto form, then the Br would add to the alpha position, C2 or C5.

So in 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, the alpha carbons are C2 and C5. Adding Br to C2 would give 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, which is option B.

Alternatively, adding Br to C5 would give 5-bromo, but that's not an option.

So, option B would be 2-bromo, option C is 4-bromo.

Wait, but why would the Br add to C2 and not C4 or another position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the alpha position of the carbonyl group, which is C2 and C5.

So, that would lead to 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, which is option B.

But I'm not so sure. Another approach is to think about the type of reaction. Enols can undergo Michael addition, but that's with nucleophiles.

Wait, perhaps the enol is acting as an electrophile? Unlikely, since it has a lone pair.

Alternatively, the enol can act as a nucleophile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible options and their structures.

Option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So the ketone is on C1, and a Br on C2.

Which would imply that the enol was converted to the keto form, and then the Br added to the alpha position.

So, the reaction would involve two steps: enol converting to keto, then Br adding to alpha.

But I'm not sure if the reaction conditions allow that. The question just says bromine; no mention of acid or base.

Wait, in the presence of an acid, the enol would be more prevalent, but in the absence of acid, the keto form might dominate. Hmm, but without knowing the conditions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition of Br2 to the enol's double bond is the main reaction, leading to a dibromide.

If that's the case, the product is a 1,2-dibromide, which is options A or D.

But which configuration?

Wait, considering that the starting material is 4,4-dimethyl, the substituents on C4 are two methyl groups. When adding Br2, the Brs would add across the double bond. The major product would have the Brs on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration.

So, the product would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R). Looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), option D is (1R,2R).

But without knowing the exact starting stereochemistry, I'm not certain which is correct. However, sometimes in these questions, the configuration is determined based on the way the substituents are arranged.

Wait, perhaps the starting double bond is in a certain configuration. Let's say the double bond is in such a way that when Br adds, the Brs end up on the same side.

Wait, but no, Br adds with anti stereochemistry. So if the starting double bond is in a certain configuration, the Brs would add to opposite faces.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a specific configuration based on the substituents. Let's imagine that in the starting double bond, the OH is on one side, and the methyl groups on C4 are on the opposite side.

So, when Br adds, it would add from the opposite side, leading to a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the diepoxide, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another thought: in the enol form, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, when Br adds to C1 and C2, the OH would be on the same side as one Br and opposite the other.

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the double bond but the OH group. Could the OH be involved in a substitution? Probably not, as Br2 is more about addition.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a bromohydrination, but that typically involves a different setup, like with H2O and an acid.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on what I know.

The reaction of an enol with bromine likely involves addition to the double bond, leading to a 1,2-dibromide. Among the options, A and D are dibromides.

The stereoisomerism depends on the addition. Since the addition is anti, the Brs are on opposite sides, so the configuration would be either (1R,2S) or (1S,2R).

Looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S). So perhaps that's the major product.

But why would it be A and not D?

Wait, perhaps the major product is a certain diastereomer based on how the Br adds.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, adding to the keto form.

Wait, but without knowing the exact reaction pathway, it's hard to choose. Another approach: think about the stability of the product.

If the major product is a bromoketone (option B), that would require the initial enol to tautomerize to the keto form, and then Br adds to the alpha position.

But that would require the enol to keto tautomerization, which is possible but perhaps less likely under standard conditions unless acid or base is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction occurs in the enol form, leading to the dibromide.

Hmm, I'm still torn between options A, B, and D.

Wait, another thought: the enol form has a conjugated double bond, so adding Br2 would lead to a more substituted (and hence more stable) dibromide. So, in a five-membered ring, the addition would proceed to give the most stable stereoisomer.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the major outcome is the formation of a trans dibromide, which would correspond to a specific configuration.

Wait, if the starting material is a cis double bond, the addition of Br from opposite sides would lead to a trans dibromide.

But wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The substituents on C4 are two methyl groups, which are on the same carbon, so perhaps they are on the same side of the ring.

If the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the substituents on either end would influence the approach of Br2.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the possible products again.

If the product is a bromoketone, then it's either option B or C. Option B is 2-bromo, option C is 4-bromo.

Wait, but 4-bromo would be on the same carbon as the two methyl groups. So option C is 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Is that plausible?

Hmm, adding Br to the same carbon as the two methyl groups would make that carbon have four substituents, which is possible but perhaps less likely due to steric hindrance.

So, option B is adding Br at C2, which is adjacent to the carbonyl, making it a more plausible product.

But why would the Br add to C2 and not elsewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't about the enol's double bond but about the alpha position of the keto form.

In conclusion, I'm torn between options A, B, and D.

But perhaps the correct answer is option B, 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of enols with bromine can lead to the formation of alpha-bromo ketones. For example, in the presence of an enol, bromine can add to the alpha position, leading to a bromoketone.

So, the enol (4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol) would react with Br2 to form 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Thus, the major product would be option B.


The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine involves the enol form of the compound, which contains a conjugated double bond and an -OH group. Bromine typically reacts with alkenes through addition, but the presence of the enol functional group introduces additional possibilities, such as electrophilic attack at the alpha position or tautomerization to the keto form.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The compound is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an -OH group on C1, and two methyl groups on C4. The enol form is in equilibrium with its keto form (4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone).

2. **Reaction Pathways**:  
   - **Addition to the Double Bond**: Bromine can add across the double bond in a stereospecific manner, leading to a 1,2-dibromide. This would result in a product like 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with stereochemistry depending on the anti addition of Brâ‚‚.  
   - **Reaction with the Keto Form**: The enol can tautomerize to the keto form, where bromine may add to the alpha position (C2 or C5) due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group. This would yield a bromoketone, such as 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. This corresponds to a 1,2-dibromide formed by anti addition of Brâ‚‚ to the double bond.  
   - **Option B**: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. This is a bromoketone formed by addition of Br to the alpha position (C2) of the keto form.  
   - **Option C**: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. This would involve bromination at C4, which is less likely due to steric hindrance from the two methyl groups.  
   - **Option D**: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. This corresponds to a 1,2-dibromide with syn stereochemistry, which is less likely due to the anti addition mechanism of Brâ‚‚.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The reaction is more likely to proceed via the keto form, where bromine adds to the alpha position (C2), yielding 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. This product is consistent with the reaction mechanism and the stability of the bromoketone.
