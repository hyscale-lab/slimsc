Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, let me think. The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the Sun's core, and we're supposed to find the ratio of neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Wait, first, I need to remember what the pp-III branch is. I think the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I branch is the first part where two protons collide and form deuterium, right? Then in pp-II, the deuterium fuses with another proton to make tritium, which then decays. Oh wait, but the pp-III branch—I think that's where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus (alpha particle) to form carbon-12, releasing a couple of protons along the way.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that would affect the rate of certain neutrino emissions. Oh right, neutrinos are produced in several steps of the pp chain. Let me recall: in the proton-proton chain, the main neutrinos come from two places. The first is the decay of boron-8 into carbon-8 (which emits a neutrino), and the second is the electron capture in the decay of tritium (that's the pep branch maybe? Or wait, I might be mixing up the branches. Oh, right, the pep branch is when a proton emits a positron and a neutrino to become a neutron, but that's a minor contributor).

Wait, the pp-III branch specifically involves the reaction where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus (alpha particle), making carbon-12. But wait, I'm a bit confused. The pp chain's main path is pp → deuterium, then deuterium + proton → tritium, which decays into helium-3 and emits a neutron. Then, in the pp-III branch, helium-3 combines with protons. Oh, right: the pp-III branch is part of the main cycle. So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens?

Well, the pp chain has two main branches: one is the pp-I and pp-II, and the other is the pp-III. The pp-III branch is where two protons and a helium-3 nucleus combine. So if that branch stops, the flow of protons into that part of the cycle would stop.

Wait, but how does that affect neutrino production? The main neutrinos from the Sun are from the boron-8 decay, which happens in the pp chain. So if the pp-III branch stops, is that affecting the production of boron-8? Or maybe it affects the overall rate of the proton-proton reactions.

Wait, let me think more carefully. In the pp chain, the steps are:

1. Two protons collide to form a deuterium nucleus (pp → ²H + positron + neutrino). This is the pp-I branch.
2. The deuterium nucleus then fuses with another proton to form tritium (²H + p → ³H + gamma). This is the pp-II branch.
3. The tritium nucleus (³H) can either decay into helium-3 (³He) by emitting a positron and a neutrino (which is the pep branch, part of the pp chain), or it can fuse with another tritium nucleus to form carbon-12 (but wait, that's not the main path, I think. Maybe I'm mixing up the details).

Wait no, the main pp chain is the pp-I and pp-II. Then, the ³H can either undergo electron capture (pep branch) or fuse with another ³H to form carbon-12 (this is the pp-III branch? Or maybe the He burning part? I'm getting a bit tangled here.)

Alternatively, I remember that the pp-III branch is where a proton adds to a helium-3 nucleus to make carbon-12. So, the ³He (from the decay of ³H) combines with a proton to make ⁴He and a gamma
