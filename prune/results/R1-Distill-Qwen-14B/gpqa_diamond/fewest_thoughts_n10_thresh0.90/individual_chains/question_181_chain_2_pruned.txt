Okay, so I've got this physics question about neutrinos from the sun, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about the sun's energy production and neutrinos.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means we're seeing the effects of that stoppage now on Earth because the neutrinos take that time to reach us. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to find F1/F2, where F1 is the flux in band 1 and F2 in band 2.

I remember that the Sun's main source of neutrinos comes from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I branch, but there are other branches like pp-II and pp-III. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos compared to the others. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, which produces lower-energy neutrinos, and the pp-II and pp-III are less significant but contribute to higher energies. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think the pp-I branch is the main one, and it produces lower-energy neutrinos, like around 50-100 keV or something. Then there are other branches, like the CNO cycle, but that's more in higher-mass stars maybe? Or wait, in the Sun, the dominant is the pp chain, with a small contribution from the CNO cycle.

Wait, the pp-III branch... I think the pp-III branch is a sub-channel of the proton-proton chain, which occurs when three protons fuse in a different way. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp-I branch because the reaction involves more mass or higher binding energy. Oh right, I think the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with higher energies. So if the pp-III suddenly stops, the flux of higher-energy neutrinos would decrease.

But wait, the question says that only the pp-III branch stopped; other reactions remain. So what does that mean for the neutrino flux?

Solar neutrinos are produced mainly via the pp-I branch, which produces neutrinos in the ~50-200 keV range. The pp-II and pp-III branches produce higher-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the higher-energy neutrinos from that branch would drop, but the lower-energy ones (from pp-I and pp-II) remain.

But wait, the neutrinos we're looking at are in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. So these are higher energies, probably in the range produced by the pp-III branch.

So if pp-III stops, the flux in the higher energy bands would drop. So if band 1 is 700-800 and band 2 is 800-900, which are both high-energy, but perhaps band 2 is higher than what pp-III produces?

Wait, I need to remember the typical energies. I think the pp-III neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, but wait, no. Wait, the neutrino energies from the pp chain. Let's think. The dominant pp-I branch produces neutrinos when a boron-8 nucleus (from two protons fusing) captures an electron, emitting a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is about 0.5 MeV, but wait, that's for the 8B neutrino. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

The main source of solar neutrinos is the pp chain, specifically the decay of boron-8. Boron-8 has a half-life of about two seconds and decays via beta plus emission to carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is around 1.4 MeV. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the neutrino from 8B decay is about 1.4 MeV, but in the Sun's core, the kinetic energy distribution of the protons affects the neutrino energies. So, the typical neutrino energy from this process is around 0.3 MeV, if I'm not mistaken. Or is it higher? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the 8B neutrinos have an energy of about 14 MeV? No, that can't be right. Wait, I think that the 8B neutrino emission has a maximum energy of about 14.06 MeV. No, wait, that's the maximum possible energy if all kinetic energy is converted into the neutrino, but in reality, the neutrinos from 8B decay have a distribution peaking around 6-7 MeV perhaps? Or maybe lower.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the typical neutrino energies from the Sun's pp chain. So, the main neutrinos we detect from the Sun are the 8B neutrinos, which come from the pp chain. These have energies up to about 14 MeV, but the average is lower, maybe around 5-10 MeV. Wait, no, that can't be right because when I think about solar neutrino experiments, like the Kamiokande or Super-Kamiokande detectors, they detect neutrinos with energies around 1-10 MeV. So the higher-energy neutrinos (like 700-900 keV, which is 0.7-0.9 MeV) are actually lower than the average. Wait, no, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, so that's lower than the typical 8B neutrino energies.

Wait, but wait. Are there other sources of neutrinos in the Sun besides the pp chain? I think there's also the CNO cycle, which contributes a smaller amount but produces higher-energy neutrinos. Oh, but pp-III is part of the pp chain, so if pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that channel would stop, but the others (like pp-I and CNO) would continue.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's restate the problem. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with higher energy than pp-I. If pp-III stops, then the flux of higher-energy neutrinos will drop. So, let's say that before the pp-III stopped, the neutrino flux in the higher energy bands (like 700-800 and 800-900 keV) was coming from both pp-III and maybe pp-II. Now, if pp-III stops, only pp-II and other branches (like CNO, if applicable) contribute to that band.

But wait, what are the energy ranges of the neutrinos from the different pp branches? I think the main pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos (like up to maybe 0.3 MeV), while the pp-II and pp-III produce higher energies. But I'm not certain about the exact ranges.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the fluxes. If the pp-III branch is a minor contributor, then stopping it would reduce the flux in the higher bands only a little. But if pp-III is a major source of high-energy neutrinos, then stopping it would significantly reduce their flux.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio between two bands. So, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are concentrated in a certain energy range. Let's say that band 1 (700-800 keV) is just below the main pp-III peak, and band 2 (800-900 keV) is in the middle. If the pp-III neutrinos are in a certain range, stopping the pp-III would make the flux in that range drop.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos at higher energies than pp-I, but perhaps not as high as the CNO cycle. Let me think. The CNO cycle is a more efficient hydrogen burning process in higher metallicity stars, and it produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp chain. For the Sun, the CNO contribution is only about 0.3-0.4% of the total energy production, compared to the pp chain's ~99%. So if the pp-III stops, the CNO neutrinos would still be present, but their contribution is small.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in the 700-900 keV range, so stopping pp-III would cause a significant drop in the flux in both bands, but perhaps more in the higher band (band 2) than band 1.

Wait, but band 1 is 700-800 and band 2 is 800-900. So if the pp-III neutrinos are mostly in the higher end, like above 800 keV, then stopping pp-III would reduce band 2's flux much more than band 1's. So the ratio F1/F2 would increase because F2 drops more than F1.

But wait, the question is asking what the ratio F1/F2 is. Before the pp-III stopped, both bands would have contributions from pp-III, pp-II, pp-I, and CNO. But if pp-III is a major contributor to the higher energies, then after stopping pp-III, the higher band (800-900 keV) would have a much lower flux, while the lower band (700-800) might have a smaller decrease.

So, if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV range, then when pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 drops a lot. But band 1 (700-800) might still have contributions from pp-II and pp-I. So the flux in band1 remains relatively higher compared to band2.

Wait, but neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy than from pp-II, so perhaps band1 (700-800) gets neutrinos from pp-II and pp-III, while band2 (800-900) gets more from pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are at the higher end, say above 900 keV, so stopping pp-III would have minimal effect on bands 700-900.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact energy ranges. Let me look for a different
