Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Each state is a combination of the spins S1, S2, S3 each being +1 or -1. Since each has two options, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll need to list all of them and calculate E for each to find the contributions to Z.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than brute-forcing all 8 possibilities. Since the energy depends on the products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3, perhaps I can find some symmetry or group states by their energies.

Let me consider each state. Each state can be represented by (S1, S2, S3).

The energy E is -J times the sum of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me compute the sum inside for each state.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state and then plug into E.

Let's list all possible states and compute S:

1. (+1, +1, +1):
   S1S2 = 1, S1S3 =1, S2S3=1. Sum S=3. E = -J*3.

2. (+1, +1, -1):
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum = 1-1-1 = -1. E = J.

3. (+1, -1, +1):
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum = -1+1-1 = -1. E=J.

4. (+1, -1, -1):
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum = -1-1+1=-1. E=J.

5. (-1, +1, +1):
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum=-1-1+1=-1. E=J.

6. (-1, +1, -1):
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum=-1+1-1=-1. E=J.

7. (-1, -1, +1):
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum=1-1-1=-1. E=J.

8. (-1, -1, -1):
   S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3. E= -3J.

Wait, so looking at the sums S:

Only two states have S=3: the all +1 and all -1 states. The other six states have S=-1.

Wait no, wait wait. Wait, let me recalculate some of these because I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait for state 2: (+1, +1, -1)
S1S2 is 1*1=1, S1S3 is 1*(-1) =-1, S2S3 is 1*(-1)=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So E is -J*(-1) = J. Correct.

State 3: (+1, -1, +1)
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1. S1S3=1*1=1. S2S3=(-1)*1=-1. Sum is (-1)+1 + (-1) = -1. So E= J. Right.

State 4: (+1, -1, -1)
S1S2 =-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3 = (-1)*(-1)=1. Sum: -1-1+1 =-1. E= J.

State 5: (-1, +1, +1)
S1S2= (-1)(+1)=-1, S1S3= (-1)(+1)=-1, S2S3= (+1)(+1)=1. Sum: -1-1+1 =-1. E= J.

Similarly, the other cases (6,7,
