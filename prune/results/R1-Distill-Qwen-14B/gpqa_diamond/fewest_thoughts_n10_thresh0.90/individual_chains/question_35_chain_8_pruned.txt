Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's parse what's given. The operator Ay is given by c times S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I'll write that out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c, that would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by each element of S. So Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
               [i, 0]]

Wait, but maybe I should write it as:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S, right. So each element of S is multiplied by that constant c.

The question is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So, I remember that for a matrix operator, the eigenvalues are found by solving the equation (Ay - aI)φ = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. Oh wait, but since Ay is 2x2, this should be manageable.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the properties of the matrix S first, and then see how c affects the eigenvalues.

The matrix S looks familiar. I think this is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, but wait, the Pauli matrices are usually sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Let me recall: the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is exactly the same as S here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is usually denoted as σy.

So, S = σy. The eigenvalues of σy are known. Wait, what are they? The Pauli matrices are 2x2 Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues ±1, right? Because for any Pauli matrix, say σx, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So, since S is σy, it has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, no—wait, the Pauli matrices have trace zero and determinant -1. Let me compute the eigenvalues. The trace is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - (-(-1)) = 0 - (1) = -1. So the eigenvalues satisfy λ^2 - (trace)λ + determinant = 0. So λ^2 - 0 + (-1) = 0 → λ^2 = 1 → λ = ±1. Oh, right, so S has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So then, since Ay = c * S, where c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay will be c * (+1) and c * (-1). So eigenvalues a = c * 1 and a = c * (-1). Substituting c, that gives a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which doesn't match. Option B says imaginary parts ±1/2, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, wait, the eigenvalues I've found are real numbers, so the imaginary part would be zero. But the options suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be right because S is Hermitian, so Ay is Hermitian as well, because c is real. So the eigenvalues should be real. So that means all options that suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts are incorrect. Let's check the options
