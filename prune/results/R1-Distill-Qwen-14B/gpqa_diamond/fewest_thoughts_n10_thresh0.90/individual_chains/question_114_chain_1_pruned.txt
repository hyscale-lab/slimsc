Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem has two reaction steps. The first is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and uses reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Then I have to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, so let's break down each reaction.

First Reaction: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When ketones react with NaCN, what typically happens? Oh right, the nucleophilic addition of cyanide. In the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding cyanide would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is CH2(COH)(CN)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me count the carbons.

Butan-2-one is four carbons: CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. Wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is (CH3)2-C-O, so the structure is:

CH3
  \
C=O
  /
CH3

Wait, no, butanone is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. So when NaCN is added with an acid catalyst, the product is the cyanohydrin: (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

So the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. For that, the conditions are typically acidic. So A should be an acid, like H3O+.

Wait, but in some cases, other acids might be used. Like, for example, H2SO4 or HCl. But the options given for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, looking at the options, option A has A as H3O+, option D has A as NaHSO3.

Wait, so in the first reaction, what's the role of A? It's the catalyst, providing the H+ for the protonation of the carbonyl group. So H3O+ is a source of H+ ions. Alternatively, NaHSO3 would provide H+ as well, but it's a sulfonic acid. Hmm, but I think the usual condition for cyanohydrin formation is HCl or H2SO4 as the acid catalyst. But in the options, option A is H3O+ and option D is NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2- (bisulfate ion). So in aqueous solution, it would supply H+ ions. So either H3O+ or NaHSO3 could act as the acid. But which is more common?

I think in the cyanohydrin formation, the acid is usually HCl, H2SO4, or H3O+ (like in a solution where H+ is provided, such as using HCl gas in water). Since the options give H3O+ and NaHSO3, I have to see which one makes sense. Hmm.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed by the addition of CN- to the carbonyl carbon, with the -OH adding to the same carbon. So the reaction is:

RCOH + CN- → R-C(OH)-CN.

But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So yes, the reaction is correct.

So the first step requires an acid catalyst. So A must be an acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, and options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, but why is NaHSO3 an option? Maybe because it can provide the necessary H+ in solution.

In the options, option D says A is NaHSO3, and option C says A is NaHSO3 as well. Wait, looking back, option C is A = NaHSO3, B = HCl; option D is A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

So for the first reaction, whether A is H3O+ or NaHSO3, it's an acid. So both could be possible. Hmm, but I remember that sometimes NaHSO3 is used as a milder acid, but in this case, I'm not so sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as the acid, making option A or B the choices. But let's look at the second reaction to see if that helps.

Second Reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile (butanenitrile) with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So the structure is something like:

HO-C(CN)(R)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, the actual structure is a bit more complex because of the benzyl groups, but the main point is that the nitrile is adjacent to a hydroxyl group.

The product is a carboxylic acid
