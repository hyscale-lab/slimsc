Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what each part is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break it down.

First, the initial compound is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. So the product here, product 1, should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond. The description says it's a light yellow solid, which makes sense because alkenes can have some color due to conjugation, but I'm not too sure about that. 

Looking at the IR spectrum data: a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that's a strong peak which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Hmm, but elimination reactions usually form alkenes, not carbonyls. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. What else could cause a peak at 1720? That's around where ketones or esters show up. Or maybe an epoxide? No, epoxides have lower wavenumbers, around 1200-1300. Wait, could it be a ketone? But how would that form from a dihalide?

Wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So if it's 1,3-dibromo, that's two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH would deprotonate and eliminate HBr, right? So elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Wait, no, 1 and 2 maybe, but 1,3 would require a different mechanism. Wait, no, elimination forms a double bond between adjacent carbons. So in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Br atoms are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because elimination needs adjacent Brs. So maybe it's a diastereomer or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? It's a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1 and 3 positions might not be adjacent. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but if the Brs are on nonadjacent carbons, elimination isn't possible. Hmm, that's confusing. So maybe the reaction is different.

Wait another thought: when two bromines are present on the same carbon, perhaps it's a dibromide. Oh wait, no, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so each Br is on a different carbon. So if they're not adjacent, they can't eliminate to form a double bond. So what else could happen?

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but with KOH, which is a strong base, more likely elimination. But if elimination isn't possible due to structure, perhaps it's a different process. Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation but in a different way. Or perhaps the KOH is acting as a base to abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to formation of a carbonyl group via some mechanism. Oh wait, that's the possibility of a keto-enol tautomerism? No, maybe not. Alternatively, if the Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, perhaps I was wrong about their positions.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. So perhaps the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent in some way. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not elimination but a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is not an alkene but a ketone. How? Maybe it's a diels-alder type of thing, but that's unlikely in this reaction. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, but then the IR wouldn't have a peak at 1720. Oh, wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. So how?

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing a Hofmann elimination, but that requires amines. Alternatively, perhaps it's a neighboring group participation. Let me think, if the adamantane has two Br atoms, perhaps they are on adjacent carbons, and when KOH is added, each Br is removed as HBr, but perhaps the structure collapses to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that's more like a double elimination maybe.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in a bridge. Wait, maybe when they eliminate, they form a bridgehead double bond, but that's not possible because bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, perhaps KOH is causing the adamantane structure to open up, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR has three sets of signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 is probably an AB quartet or a multiplet, but 2H. Maybe it's an -OH group? But KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonated. Alternatively, maybe it's an -O- group. Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But then where would the 2H at 4.79 come from? Maybe it's an ethylene group adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, like a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group, but that would show up lower, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl peak.

Wait, maybe the initial product is an epoxide. No, epoxides don't have a carbonyl. So this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. Another possibility is that the dihalide upon treatment with KOH undergoes a substitution reaction, but with two adjacent Brs, perhaps forming an oxide bridge. Wait, but that would require elimination of two HBr molecules. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a ketone via a double elimination. How?

Ah, wait, maybe the structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, allowing for a double elimination. So when KOH is added, both Brs are removed as HBr, and the structure becomes a carbonyl. So, for example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in a bridge, eliminating both would form a carbonyl group in the bridge. But I'm not entirely sure about the structure.

Alternatively, if the product has a ketone group, the IR would have a peak around 1720, which matches. The NMR would then have signals from the carbonyl adjacent protons. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone with a CH2CH2 group or something similar.

But wait, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So perhaps elimination from vicinal dihalide to form an alkene, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Unless the reaction is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the possible structures.

Adamantane has a structure that's quite rigid. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two of the bridgeheads. Heating with KOH could cause an elimination reaction, but since the Brs are not adjacent, elimination would not form a double bond. Wait, but maybe they are on adjacent bridgeheads. Wait, maybe in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are adjacent on the same face, allowing for a double elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone because both Brs are eliminated, and the structure forms a bridgehead carbonyl. But bridgehead carbonyls are allowed, unlike bridgehead double bonds.

So if each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, eliminating both would form a carbonyl group. So the product would have a ketone.

So product 1 is a ketone, let's say 1,3-diketoadamantane (but I'm not sure of the actual name). The NMR then would show a singlet for the carbonyl (but in NMR, carbonyls don't show protons). The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the other CH2 groups in the
