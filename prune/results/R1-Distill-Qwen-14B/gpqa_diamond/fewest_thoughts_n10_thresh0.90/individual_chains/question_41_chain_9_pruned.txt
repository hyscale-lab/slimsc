Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through glass that's moving. Hmm, I remember that when things move relative to each other, especially when involving light, you have to consider relativity or maybe some sort of velocity addition. Oh wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass as observed from the lab frame.

The problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam, and toward the observer? Wait, no, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So if the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and the beam is moving toward the observer, so the glass is moving toward the observer as well?

But wait, the beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is also moving towards the observer. Wait, that's a bit tricky.

I think I need to consider the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass. The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. So normally, in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n, since n is the refractive index. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but according to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. But this isn't a vacuum; it's glass. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but when the glass is moving, does the observer in the lab see any change in the speed?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the glass is moving, but the light is within the glass. So perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the glass is moving, so the speed of the light as observed in the lab would be different.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v1 = c/n (since in vacuum c is the speed, and in glass it's c/n). But the glass itself is moving at velocity u = v relative to the lab. So I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

The velocity addition formula in special rel
