Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The formula I think involves bond energies. Oh right, the general approach is to calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants and then the energy released when forming bonds in the products.

But wait, for the enthalpy of formation, the formula uses the bond energies of the bonds broken and formed. The standard formula is: ΔH°f = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds). Wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think it's the other way around. Or is it the sum of the energies of the bonds in the reactants minus the products? Wait, no, actually, no. Because when bonds are broken, you're putting energy in, and when they form, you release energy.

So for the formation of a molecule, you start with the elements in their standard states and build the molecule. So the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when that happens. But when calculating it using bond energies, you take the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (the elements, which are diatomic molecules) and subtract the bond energies of the product molecule's bonds.

Wait, no, wait. Hmm, maybe another approach: the enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy required to break all the bonds in the elements (like O2, N2, etc.) into atoms and then the energy released when forming the bonds in the target molecule.

Wait, but in this problem, maybe the approach is to calculate the total bond energies in the compound and then relate it to the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a mole of bonds in an element to produce atoms of the element. For carbon, which is graphite or diamond, but I think in this problem, they give it as 1000 kJ/mol.

So, perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation by considering all the bonds in the molecule and the bonds in the elements (like H2 and C) that are broken to form it.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Find the number of each type of bond in the molecule. That includes C-C, C=C, C-H, H-H bonds.

2. Calculate the total bond energy for all bonds in the molecule.

3. Then, think about how the molecule is formed from its elements. For carbon, each C atom would come from breaking C-C bonds (since in graphite, each bond is shared between multiple atoms, but perhaps the given bond energy is per mole of bonds). Similarly, hydrogen would come from H-H bonds.

Wait, the problem gives bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, H-H. The enthalpy of atomization for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. So, perhaps the process is:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds)

Wait, but the reactants here are the elements (C and H2), and the product is the target molecule.

So, the formation reaction would be something like:

a C (graphite) + b H2 → 1 mol target molecule.

But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry here. Let me think. The target molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, let's count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule.

Each (CH3)2 group is a substituent on a carbon. Let me draw it mentally. It's a diene, perhaps? Or maybe a conjugated system. Hmm, maybe it's 1,3-pentadiene or something, but the exact structure might not matter for counting atoms.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of C and H atoms.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, that's a bit complicated, but let's parse it:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-... So, the first group is (CH3)2C=CH-, which is a propene-like group but substituted. Let me count each part:

The formula can be broken down as:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group has 2 CH3, 1 C, 1 CH, so C: 4, H: (3*2) + (1*3) = 6 +3=9? Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count each C and H.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the entire molecule:

The structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, let's count the C and H.

- Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 C and 6 H (since each CH3 has 3 H).
Wait, no. Each (CH3)2 group is attached to a central C: like (CH3)2C.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each part:

Let me write the structure:

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to write it as a series of carbons with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a chain with double bonds:

But perhaps the exact structure isn't crucial. Let me think about the number of each bond in the molecule.

Wait, but perhaps the problem doesn't require that. Let me think about the general approach.

The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf° = [sum of (number of bonds × bond energy) for all bonds in reactants] - [sum of (number of bonds × bond energy) for all bonds in product].

But the reactants are the elements in their standard states. For carbon, it's graphite (so C-C bonds), and for hydrogen, it's H2 (H-H bonds).

So, the process is:

1. Break down the target molecule into its constituent atoms (C and H), which involves breaking all the bonds in the molecule.

2. Then, form the bonds in the reactants (graphite and H2).

Wait, no, wait. Because the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the molecule is formed from the elements. So, the elements are the reactants, and the molecule is the product.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum (bonds broken in reactants)] - [sum (bonds formed in product)]

Wait, but the reactants are in their standard states. So, for C, the bonds broken are C-C bonds (since graphite has C-C bonds), and for H, the bonds broken are H-H bonds.

So, for each mole of the target molecule, we have:

Number of C atoms: Let's count the C in the formula.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group is a methyl group. Let's count the number of C atoms.

Each CH3 has 1 C, and there are two of them in each (CH3)2 group. So the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: that's 2 (from CH3) + 1 (the central C) + 1 (the CH) = 4 C?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count each C in the formula.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me
