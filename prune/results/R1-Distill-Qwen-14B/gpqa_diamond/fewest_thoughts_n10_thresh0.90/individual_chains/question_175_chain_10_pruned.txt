Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates with a certain wavelength λ. They're asking about the radiated power in the radiation zone. The power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ, measured along the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and they want the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, as well as the form of f.

I remember that when a charge oscillates, it radiates electromagnetic waves, and the radiation pattern depends on the dipole moment or higher multipoles. Since it's a spheroid, maybe it's a dipole antenna situation? Or perhaps it's a higher-order multipole, but spheroids are usually dipole-like in shape.

Wait, the problem mentions the function f is a function of λ and θ. So the power per unit solid angle is f(λ,θ). The maximum power is A, so when is the power maximum? For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (θ=90 degrees), right? Because the dipole emits more strongly perpendicular to its axis.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think for a dipole, the radiation is strongest when θ is 90 degrees. So the maximum power would be at θ=90. But the question is asking for the fraction at θ=30 degrees. Hmm.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again. The radiation pattern for a dipole is such that the intensity varies with (sinθ)^2, I think. Oh wait, no, the intensity (power per unit area) for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2. But wait, that's in the far field or radiation zone, where the fields are approximated as plane waves.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity multiplied by the area element. Oh wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing intensity and power per unit solid angle. Because intensity is power per unit area, but power per unit solid angle would be in the context of the radiation's direction—so the power emitted into a small solid angle dΩ is P = I * dA, where I is intensity, but dA depends on the angle. Wait, maybe it's better to model the radiation pattern.

For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern in the far field is such that the intensity (I) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. The maximum intensity occurs at θ=90 degrees. But wait, the power per unit solid angle—since solid angle is dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ—so the total power is the integral of I * sinθ dθ dφ over all angles. But when considering the power per unit solid angle, which I think is the same as the intensity multiplied by the area element, but perhaps the way the question is phrased, f(λ,θ) is the power per unit solid angle. So for a dipole, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Wait, but then the maximum would be at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ is 1.

So the maximum power (A) would be the maximum of f. So at θ=30 degrees, which is less than 90, sinθ is 0.5. So the power at θ=30 would be (0.5)^2 = 0.25 times the maximum—so 1/4 of A. So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the function f is the power per unit solid angle. For a dipole, the power emitted into a solid angle is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So f ~ (sinθ)^2. The maximum value of f is when sinθ is 1 (
