Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at changes in the target gene's sequence, specifically in the first exon area.

The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I need to figure out which mutation would do that. The options are Mutant 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me look at the sequences provided. The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... and ends with TGA. The mutants have changes in the beginning of the first exon.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... So, comparing to the intact gene: original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT.

Wait, let me write out the beginning of the intact gene and each mutant to compare:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACAT...
Mutant1: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACAT...
Wait, wait. Wait, let me align them better.

Intact: positions 1-20:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT

Mutant1: 
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT

So, the first few nucleotides changed from TTT to TTC, and CTC to TAC. Let me see the DNA changes. So, the original exons would be part of the mRNA. Since the gene is the DNA sequence, the mRNA would be complementary. Wait, but in the question, the sequences are given as the gene, which is DNA. So the changes are in the DNA.

Wait, but looking at the amino acids. The original starts with ATG (methionine), then TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu). In Mutant1, it's TTC (Phe?), TAC (Tyr). Oh wait, DNA is double-stranded; the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T for U.

So, the original DNA in exons (since exons are coding) would be the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U.

So the first exon's DNA is:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the first codon is ATG (same, Met). Second codon in intact is TTT (Phe). In Mutant1, it's TTC (also Phe). So the second codon is same, but third codon in intact is CTC (Leu). In Mutant1, it's TAC. Wait, TAC is the codon for Tyr (tyrosine). So the third codon changes from Leu to Tyr.

But the rest are the same. So the amino acid sequence would change at that position.

But how does that relate to the anti-nutritional compound? We want to eliminate it. So perhaps a mutation that disrupts the gene's function would be a nonsense or frameshift mutation, leading to a truncated protein that might not produce the compound.

Looking at the other mutants:

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, the third codon in Mutant2 is TAA, which is a stop codon (since TAA is one of the three: TAG, TAA, TGA). So in Mutant2, the second codon is TTC (Phe), third is TAA (stop). So the protein would be truncated after the second amino acid.

That's a strong possibility. If the gene is disrupted early with a stop codon, the protein may not be functional. So the compound wouldn't be synthesized.

Mutant3: ATG TT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAA CT...

Wait, perhaps I should look again. Let me write it.

Mutant3's sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Original was ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, in Mutant3, the first few changes are: 

ATG (same), then TTT becomes TTA (Leu), and CTC becomes CGC (Arg), then GCT becomes GCT (no change), GGT becomes GGT (same?), ACT becomes TCA (Ser). Wait, perhaps I should compare each codon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the DNA changes.

But maybe I should focus on which mutations would result in a nonfunctional protein.

So, let's go through each mutant:

Mutant1: Changes in the third codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). So the amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr. But it's still a codon for an amino acid, so the protein is still produced but with a different AA. Unless this change disrupts the function (like altering a critical residue), the compound might still be produced. So unless it's a critical position, this may not eliminate the compound.

Mutant2: Changes lead to a stop codon at the third position. So the protein would be shorter, maybe nonfunctional. This would likely disrupt the gene's function, leading to the compound not being made.

Mutant3: Let's see. The DNA sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...

So, in Mutant3, the first codon is same (ATG), second is TTT (same as original: Phe), third is TAC (Tyr, same as Mutant1), then GCT (same as original), GGT same, ACT becomes TCA.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the amino acids. Let me write each codon:

Intact:

1. ATG → Met

2. TTT → Phe

3. CTC → Leu

4. GCT → Ala

5. GGT → Gly

6. ACT → Thr

7. TCT → Ser

8. GTG → Val

9. GAT → Asp

Mutant3’s DNA:

1. ATG → Met

2. TTT → Phe

3. TAC → Tyr

4. GCT → Ala

5. GGT → Gly

6. GTC → Val (because the DNA is GTC, which would be Val in mRNA (GUC))

Wait, wait, perhaps I should write out each codon as mRNA.

Wait, the gene is DNA, the mRNA is the non-template strand, same as the gene, but U instead of T.

Wait, no, the mRNA is synthesized from the template (antisense) strand, so the coding (sense) strand is same as the mRNA.

So, the gene's sequence is the same as the mRNA, except T for U.

So, in Mutant3, the DNA sequence is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps I should break it down.

Original:

Positions 1-3: ATG (Met)

4-6: TTT (Phe)

7-9: CTC (Leu)

10-12: GCT (Ala)

13-15: GGT (Gly)

16-18: ACT (Thr)

19-21: TCT (Ser)

22-24: GTG (Val)

25-27: GAT (Asp)

Mutant3:

1-3: ATG → Met

4-6: TTT → Phe

7-9: TAC → Tyr

10-12: GCT → Ala

13-15: GGT → Gly

16-18: GTC → Val (since DNA is GTC → mRNA would be GUC, which is Val)

19-21: ACT → Thr

22-24: TCT → Ser

25-27: GTG → Val

Wait, but looking at the DNA. For the third codon, it's TAC. So in the mRNA, it's UAC, which is Tyr. So the amino acids would be Met, Phe, Tyr, Ala, Gly, Val, Thr, Ser, Val, etc.

So, this changes the amino acid from Leu (original) to Tyr in position 3, then Val in position 6 instead of Thr. So, it's changing two amino acids. But unless that disrupts the function, the gene might still produce the compound. So unless this creates a nonfunctional protein, it's not the answer. But the question is about eliminating the compound, so probably a disruption of the gene.

Mutant4: Sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, Mutant4's DNA is:

ATG (same)

TTT (same)

TAC (Tyr, position 3)

GCT (Ala, position 4)

ACT (instead of GCT? Wait, let me see. The original is GCT (Ala) at positions 7-9 (since in the original, positions 7-9 are CTC). Wait, maybe I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking it down:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so positions 1-3: ATG → Met

4-6: TTT → Phe

7-9: TAC → Tyr

10-12: GCT → Ala

13-15: ACT → Thr

16-18: TCT → Ser

19-21: GTG → Val

22-24: GAT → Asp

Wait compared to original, the original's positions 13-15 are ACT (Thr), so same here, same as Mutant4? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, perhaps looking for indels, because if the reading frame shifts, that might cause a frameshift mutation, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from the mutation point onward, possibly leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, in the intact gene, the exons are correctly spliced. Let me see the sequences of the mutants:

Looking for any insertions or deletions.

Wait, perhaps the question states that the changes are at the beginning of the first exon. So perhaps a deletion or insertion could cause a frameshift.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: ...TGTGGATGAACATATTTAT...

Mutant1: ...TGTGGATGAACATATTTAT...

Wait no, looking again:

Wait, let me line them up.

Intact:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, from the start:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the first 6 nucleotides: Intact is ATGTTT (positions 1-6), Mutant1 is ATG TTC (positions 1-6).

So, that's the same length. No insertion or deletion; just substitutions.

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Again, same length, so no frameshift. So codon 3 is TAA, a stop.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Same length, no frameshift. Changes in amino acids.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, let me look again.

Mutant4's sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ 

So, the first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT... 

Original is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...

So, in the original, after TTT (positions 4-6), the next is CTC (positions 7-9) → Leu.

In Mutant4, after TTT (positions 4-6), it's TAC (positions 7-9 → Tyr), then GCT (positions 10-12 → Ala), then ACT (positions 13-15 → Thr).

Wait, in the original, after GCT (positions 10-12 is GCT → Ala), the next is GGT (positions 13-15 → Gly).

But in Mutant4, positions 13-15 are ACT → Thr.

So, the sequence is same length, so no frameshift.

So, all the mutants except maybe Mutant4 have same length? Wait, the end part for Mutant4 is:

...TTCTGTGGAT...

Original ends with ...TCTGTGGAT...

Wait, checking the sequences:

Intact:

...TGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant4:

...TGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Wait, same as intact? No, wait, the initial part is different. The main change in Mutant4 is probably in the middle.

Wait, perhaps another approach: which mutation introduces a premature stop codon?

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant2: third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be much shorter.

Mutant1: third codon is TAC (Tyr), so continues.

Mutant3: third codon is TAC (Tyr), continues.

Mutant4: structure-wise, is there a stop codon introduced?

Looking at Mutant4's sequence: after the first part:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So codons:

1. Met (ATG)

2. Phe (TTT)

3. Tyr (TAC)

4. Ala (GCT)

5. Thr (ACT)

6. Ser (TCT)

7. Val (GTG)

8. Asp (GAT)

No stop codons in the first 8, but the sequence continues.

So, in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA (stop), so the protein is Met-Phe and then stops. So the protein would be shorter, perhaps nonfunctional.

If the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, disrupting the gene (like introducing a stop codon) would prevent the compound from being made.

So, the correct answer would be the mutant that introduces a stop codon.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Mutant 2: has TAA as the third codon → stop.

Option B) Mutant3: no stop.

Option C) Mutant1: no stop.

Option D) Mutant4: no stop.

So, the correct answer is A) Mutant 2.


To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, the goal is to disrupt the gene responsible for its synthesis. The question provides sequences of the intact gene and four mutant versions, with changes occurring in the first exon. The analysis focuses on identifying which mutation most likely disrupts the gene's function, thereby preventing the compound from being produced.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:
   - DNA sequence: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...`
   - Codon changes:
     - First codon: `ATG` (Met, unchanged).
     - Second codon: `TTT` (Phe) → `TTC` (Phe, same amino acid).
     - Third codon: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr, different amino acid).
   - No frameshift or stop codon introduced. The protein is still produced, but with a single amino acid change. This likely does not eliminate the compound.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - DNA sequence: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...`
   - Codon changes:
     - First codon: `ATG` (Met, unchanged).
     - Second codon: `TTT` (Phe) → `TTC` (Phe, same amino acid).
     - Third codon: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAA` (stop codon).
   - The introduction of `TAA` as a stop codon results in a truncated protein. This disruption likely prevents the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound, making this mutant a strong candidate.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - DNA sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...`
   - Codon changes:
     - First codon: `ATG` (Met, unchanged).
     - Second codon: `TTT` (Phe, unchanged).
     - Third codon: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr, different amino acid).
     - Sixth codon: `ACT` (Thr) → `GTC` (Val, different amino acid).
   - No frameshift or stop codon introduced. The protein is still produced, but with two amino acid changes. This likely does not eliminate the compound.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - DNA sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...`
   - Codon changes:
     - First codon: `ATG` (Met, unchanged).
     - Second codon: `TTT` (Phe, unchanged).
     - Third codon: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr, different amino acid).
     - Fourth codon: `GCT` (Ala, unchanged).
     - Fifth codon: `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr, different amino acid).
   - No frameshift or stop codon introduced. The protein is still produced, but with two amino acid changes. This likely does not eliminate the compound.

### Conclusion:
The most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a stop codon (`TAA`), resulting in a truncated and nonfunctional protein. This disruption prevents the synthesis of the compound.

**Answer: A**
