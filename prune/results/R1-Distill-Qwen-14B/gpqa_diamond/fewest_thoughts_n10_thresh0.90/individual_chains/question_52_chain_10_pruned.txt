Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read through it carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember that when stars have spots, they can change their overall temperature and emission.

The star's normal parameters are 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait—does that mean the spots are cooler regions? Because if spots are dark, they must be emitting less, so they're at a lower temperature than the surrounding photosphere. Oh right, I think the spots are actually cooler, so they emit less light but are physically present on the star's surface.

Now, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because higher energy levels have fewer atoms at lower temperatures.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range. Hmm, but I don't think the wavelength directly affects the ratio except through the energy difference.

So, first, let's find the energy difference between the two levels. The energy E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. But wait, wavelength is in Ångströms, so 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters.

Calculating E for each level? Wait, no, because the energy difference ΔE is E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = let's compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, we can also express this energy in terms of eV because working in electron volts might make it easier when dealing with thermal energies. Let me think: 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So, 1.373e-18 J is approximately 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1.448e-7 m.

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So yes, about 1.373e-18 J. Converting to eV: 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, is that the ionization energy for Ti? No, wait, that's the energy difference between the two levels we're considering.

But wait, in the problem, we have neutral Ti, so Ti I. So, the energy levels are in the neutral atom.

Now, in LTE, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights. But the problem doesn't mention anything about g, so I think we can assume that the statistical weights are the same for both levels, so the ratio simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but wait, actually, the general formula is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if n1 is the lower level, and n2 the higher, then E2 > E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. Therefore, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). If g1/g2 is 1, then n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

But the problem mentions the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the Teff is lower. Because T is lower, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller. Which matches the observation. So that's consistent.

So, the ratio without spots is when T is higher (6000 K), and with spots, T is lower (5500 K).

We need to calculate the ratio (n1/n2) for T=6000 K divided by the ratio at T=5500 K.

So, the factor is [ (n1/n2)_6000 ] / [ (n1/n2)_5500 ].

Which is [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ].

Simplify:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

So, the factor is exp( (ΔE / k) (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)) )

Wait, let's compute that. Let's compute the exponent:

(ΔE/(k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)

Hmm, let's compute the term (1/5500 - 1/6000). Let me compute 1/5500 = approx 1.818e-4, and 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4. So the difference is about 1.518e-5.

Wait, wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

1/5500 = 0.000181818...
1/6000 = 0.000166667...
Difference: 0.0000151515... = 1.51515e-5 K^-1.

So, (ΔE/(k)) * 1.515e-5.

ΔE is 8.57 eV. Let's compute it in Joules: 8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.372e-18 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So, (ΔE / k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Wait, wait, let me compute this accurately:

1.372e-18 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ (1.372 / 1.380649) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1.0 * 1e5, since 1.372/1.38 is about 0.994. So approximately 9.94e4 K.

Wait, but 1e5 is 10^5, so 9.94e4 is about 99,400.

So, (ΔE/(k)) ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Now, multiply this by 1.515e-5 K^-1:

9.94e4 K * 1.515e-5 K^-1 = 9.94e4 * 1.515e-5.

Which is (9.94 * 1.515) * 1e-1.

9.94 * 1.515 ≈ Let's compute:

10 * 1.515=15.15. Subtract 0.06*1.515≈0.0909. So approx 15.15 - 0.09 = 15.06.

Wait, wait, no: 9.94 is 10 minus 0.06.

So, 10 * 1.515 = 15.15.

0.06 * 1.515 = 0.0909.

So, 10 * 1.515 = 15.15, and 9.94=10-0.06.

So, 9.94 * 1.515 = 15.15 - 0.0909 = 15.0591.

So approximately 15.0591.

Multiply by 1e-1: 1.50591.

So the exponent is approximately 1.506.

So, the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ what?

Hmm, e^1.5 is about 4.4817. e^0.006 is about 1.006. So, 4.4817 * 1.006 ≈ 4.509.

Wait, but wait, let me compute more accurately. Let's compute 1.506.

We can compute e^1.506:

We know that e^1 = 2.71828, e^0.5 ≈1.6487. So e^1.5 is approx 4.4817.

But 1.506 is 1.5 +0.006.

So e^1.506 = e^1.5 * e^0.006.

e^0.006 is approx 1 + 0.006 + (0.006^2)/2 ≈ 1.006018.

So, 4.4817 * 1.006018 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.006 ≈ 4.4817 + (0.004 *4.4817) = 4.4817 +0.0179≈4.4996.

So about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check all steps for errors.

Wait, the exponent in the ratio factor is positive because when you have (n1/n2)_Teff_high / (n1/n2)_Teff_low, you get exp(ΔE/(k) (1/Te_low - 1/Te_high) ), because the exponent is ΔE/k (1/Te_low - 1/Te_high).

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the terms.

The factor is [ (n1/n2) at 6000 ] / [ (n1/n2) at 5500 ].

Each (n1/n2) is exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the ratio is [ exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

Which is exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Which is the same as I did before. So the exponent is positive 1.506, leading to e^1.506≈4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots (5500 K), the ratio is lower. So when we compare no spots (higher T, higher ratio) to spots (lower T, lower ratio), the factor is higher. So the factor is indeed about 4.5, which is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the effective temperature of the star.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference (\( \Delta E \)):**  
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Ratio of Ratios:**  
   The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{low}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{high}}}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \( T_{\text{high}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{low}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Substituting \( \Delta E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV} \), \( k = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and converting \( \Delta E \) to joules:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.380649 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
   \]
   The temperature difference term is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_{\text{low}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{high}}} = \
