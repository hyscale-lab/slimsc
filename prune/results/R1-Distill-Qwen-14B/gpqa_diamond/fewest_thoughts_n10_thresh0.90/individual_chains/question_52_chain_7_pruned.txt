Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and think through what it's asking.

The question is about a star where when spots cover part of its surface, the effective temperature changes. We're looking at how the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem states that the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels (level 1 and 2) decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—meaning, what's the ratio when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm. So when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That means the original ratio (without spots) is higher than the one with spots. So the factor should be a number greater than 1. Let's think about why the ratio changes.

I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, no, actually, the ratio is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). But since E2 > E1 (because level 2 is higher energy), this makes sense. So if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio N2/N1 decreases. Because the exponential gets smaller as T decreases.

Wait, but the problem says that when there are spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has lower T (5500 K), the ratio drops. So when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher. So the factor we're looking for is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots).

So let's compute the ratio of N2/N1 in each case and find the factor.

But wait, the problem isn't about N2/N1, it's about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels, but I think it's the same thing. So let's proceed.

Assuming that the energy difference is given by the wavelength of transition. The transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet. The energy E is related to wavelength by E = hc/λ. So E = hc/(lambda).

So, E2 - E1 = hc/lambda. Let me compute that. Let's plug in the numbers.

h is Planck's constant, approximately
