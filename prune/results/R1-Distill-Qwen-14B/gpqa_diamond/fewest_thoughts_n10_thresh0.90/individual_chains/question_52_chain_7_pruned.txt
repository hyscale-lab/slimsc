Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through the question again.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in LTE, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, say level 2 and level 1, is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor we're looking for is (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_with_spots. 

But wait, what's the effect of temperature on this ratio? The exponential term depends on temperature. If the effective temperature decreases, what happens to the ratio? Let me think. The exponential term is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential smaller. So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease if ΔE is positive (since E2 is higher than E1, I assume).

Wait, but if the spots are cooler, that would lower the effective temperature of the overall photosphere. So when the star has spots, the average T_eff is lower. 

Wait, but the photosphere is in LTE, but when spots are present, the temperature of the photosphere (the areas without spots) might be higher? Or does the problem mean that the overall average temperature of the photosphere drops because 40% is covered by cooler spots. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So I think the overall T_eff is lower because the spots are cooler, and they cover a significant part. So the star's photosphere as a whole is now at 5500 K when spots are present.

But wait, maybe the spots are actually cooler regions. So when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions. Wait, no, wait: when the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So I think that the presence of spots makes the star emit less total flux, hence the effective temperature is lower. So the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but wait, stars have their own temperature structure. Spots are usually cooler regions on the star's surface. So when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler (lower T) than the rest. So the overall effective temperature would be lower than the unspotted case.

But in this problem, the Teff when the surface is covered 40% by spots is 5500 K. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower overall.

But the observed ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So we need to find the factor (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present. So the factor is the ratio when no spots divided by when spots are present.

So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K.

The formula for the ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same (which I don't think is given, but perhaps the question doesn't require considering g2/g1 if the ratio is given for the same element, so maybe g2/g1 is a constant, so when calculating the factor, it may cancel out).

Wait, but the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So the factor is [ (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 ] = [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) ) / (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Wait, because when you divide, the g2/g1 terms cancel.

So the exponent is [ (ΔE/k) * (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 500 / 3.3e7 = approx 1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (ΔE / k) * (1.515e-5)

But what is ΔE? It's the energy difference between the two levels. Since the transition corresponds to wavelength λ=1448 Å, we can find ΔE using the relation E = hc/λ.

Let me compute that. h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is (1.372e-18) / (1.602e-19) ) ≈ 8.56 eV.

So ΔE is about 8.56 eV.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So yes, that's correct.

Now, k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So the exponent is (8.56 eV) * (1.38e-23 J/K / eV) ) * (1.515e-5) 

Wait, wait, I need to convert eV to J. Because E is in eV, and k is in J/K.

So 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 8.56 eV is 8.56 * 1.602e-19 = approx 1.371e-18 J.

So now, calculate (ΔE / k) * (1.515e-5)

ΔE/k = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.371/1.38) * 1e5 K ≈ approx 0.993 * 1e5 ≈ 99,300 K.

Multiply by 1.515e-5: 99,300 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.504.

So the exponent is approximately 1.504.

So the factor is exp(1.504) ≈ e^1.5 ≈ about 4.48.

Wait, because e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is around 4.48.

So the ratio (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 is e^(1.504) ≈ 4.48.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Hmm, let me compute the exponent more accurately.

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

1/5500 = 0.000181818...

1/6000 = 0.000166666...

Difference is 0.0000151515. So 1.51515e-5.

Then, ΔE = hc/λ.

h=6.626e-34, c=3e8, λ=1448e-10.

h*c = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Then, (ΔE/k) = (8.56 eV) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )

So that's (8.56 * 1.602e-19) / 1.38e-23 = (13.71e-19) / 1.38e-23 = (13.71 / 1.38) * 1e4.

13.71 /1.38 ≈9.93, so 9.93e4 K.

So (ΔE/k) * (1.515e-5) = 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.93 * 1.515 ≈ 15.06.

Wait, wait! Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, the exponent is (ΔE)/(k T^2)? No, the formula is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when star has Teff T1=6000, the ratio is (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

When it's T2=5500, the ratio is (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The factor is [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, no: wait, because (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, wait, let me think again.

(n2/n1)_T1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

(n2/n1)_T2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) 

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Ah, so the exponent is ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 -1/T1 )

In our case, T1 is 6000 K (no spots), T2 is 5500 K (with spots). So (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive.

So the exponent is positive, so the ratio is greater than 1, meaning the ratio increases when the temperature decreases. Wait, but the problem states that when spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2, which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Which is the same as earlier.

So the exponent is (ΔE / k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) 

Which we calculated as approximately 1.504.

So exp(1.504) ≈ 4.48. So the factor is ~4.5.

But wait, let me compute that exponent more accurately.

Wait, 1/5500 = 0.000181818...

1/6000 = 0.000166666...

Difference is 0.0000151515, or 1.51515e-5.

So,

(ΔE / k ) = (8.56 eV) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (1.38e-23 J/K) 

Wait, 8.56 *1.602e-19 = 13.71e-19 J.

Divided by 1.38e-23 J/K gives 13.71e-19 / 1.38e-23 = (13.71/1.38) * e4 → 9.93 * 1e4 = 9.93e4 K.

Multiply by 1.515e-5: 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.93 * 1.515 * 1e-1 → 15.06 * 0.1 → 1.506.

So the
