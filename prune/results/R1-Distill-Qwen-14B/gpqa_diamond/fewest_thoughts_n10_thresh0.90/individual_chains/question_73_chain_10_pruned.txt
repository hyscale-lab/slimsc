Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m, right? And they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, but in relativity, mass can be tricky because of the concept of relativistic mass. Oh, wait, but I think in this context, when the problem says their masses are 2m and 3m, it's referring to their rest masses. Because in relativity, the total energy includes their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy.

So, the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Let me tackle the relative speed first. I remember that when you have two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract their velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Instead, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Oh wait, wait, because both are moving in the same direction, v1 is the velocity of the first astronaut (0.6c), and v2 is the velocity of the second astronaut (0.5c). So the relative speed would be how much faster the first is moving compared to the second. So I should plug in v1 and v2 into the formula.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for relative speed when both are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). So let's compute that. Let me calculate the numerator first: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, that matches options C and D, which have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, which is given by the total energy formula E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = Gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):
Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let me compute sqrt(0.75). Hmm, sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So Gamma2 ≈ 1.1547. E2 = Gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy of the system E_total is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this value. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower. So option C seems correct for energy.

Wait, let me check the calculations again. Gamma1: 0.6c. 0.6^2 is 0.36, so 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, so gamma is 1.25. Correct. E1 is 2m *1.25 c²= 2.5 mc².

Gamma2: 0.5² is 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0
