Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question states: two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two velocities. Oh right! Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition formula. Instead, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). 

Wait, wait, no. Let me get that right. The formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving at u and v relative to the same frame (say, the lab frame) is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, actually, each astronaut is moving in the same direction, so one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c. So what's their relative speed? So from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.5c, what's the speed of the other astronaut (moving at 0.6c) relative to him? Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, the problem could be asking for the speed of one as seen from the other. Let me think: if both are moving in the same direction, say, the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) at 0.5c. So, from the perspective of the second astronaut, what's the speed of the first?

Wait, no. Actually, in relativity, when you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed between them is not simply 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Because at high speeds, that's not how it works. So I need to calculate it using the relativistic formula.

The formula for relative velocity u' from the perspective of an observer moving at velocity v with respect to the initial frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v
