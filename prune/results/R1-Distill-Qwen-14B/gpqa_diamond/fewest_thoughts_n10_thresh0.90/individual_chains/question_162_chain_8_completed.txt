Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric, so it's probably on a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space. Oh right, pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry, right?

Wait, okay, the area of a pseudosphere. I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (well, a pseudosphere) relates to its radius. But wait, what's a pseudosphere exactly? I think it's a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape but with a finite area. Or wait, does it have finite or infinite area? I'm confused now.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere in hyperbolic space... Let me think. In Euclidean space, a sphere's area is 4πr². But in hyperbolic, things are different. Oh wait, in hyperbolic space, the area of a sphere (which is a pseudosphere) actually increases with distance. Because hyperbolic geometry has negative curvature, so the area grows exponentially as you move away from a point.

But the radius given here is r=2. Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. So I need to find its area. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps this metric is describing a pseudosphere, and I need to compute its area using the given ds².

Wait, the metric is ds² = [32/(4−x²−y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me analyze this. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh, so when x² + y² <4, the denominator is positive. So the domain where this metric is defined is the disk x² + y² <4. That's a radius 2 in the x-y plane. So this is a metric on a disk of radius 2.

Wait, okay, in two dimensions, the area element is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric here is diagonal, so determinant would be (32/(4−x²−y²))². Wait, no, the determinant of a diagonal metric is (g_xx)(g_yy). So for this metric, g_xx = 32/(4−x²−y²), same for g_yy. So determinant is (32/(4−r²))², where r² = x² + y².

So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since the metric is conformally flat (it's a scalar multiple of the flat metric), the area element becomes (32/(4−r²)) dx dy. Wait, no, because sqrt(det g) is sqrt( (32/(4−r²))^2 ) = 32/(4−r²). So dA = [32/(4−r²)] dx dy.

But wait, using polar coordinates would make this easier. Let me switch to polar coordinates where x² + y² = r², dx dy = r dr dθ. So the area element becomes [32/(4−r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the total area is the integral over r from 0 to 2 (since 4−r² must be positive) and θ from 0 to 2π.

So Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4−r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, the integral over θ is straightforward. The integral of dθ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So Area = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4−r²)] dr.

Simplify the integral. Let me factor out the 32: 32 * ∫ [r/(4−r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So (-1/2) du = r dr. Then the integral becomes:

∫ [r/(u)] dr = ∫ (1/u) * (-1/2) du.

Wait, when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the limits change from u=4 to u=0 as r goes from 0 to 2.

So the integral becomes (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0.

But changing the limits, when r increases from 0 to 2, u decreases from 4 to 0. So when you reverse the limits, the integral becomes positive. So ∫ from 4 to 0 is same as -∫ from 0 to4. Let me think.

Wait, the substitution gives:

∫ (r=0 to2) [r/(4−r²)] dr = (-1/2) ∫ (u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du = (1/2) ∫ (u=0 to4) (1/u) du.

But wait, ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4 is ln(u) from 0 to4. Hmm, but ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait a second, does this integral converge?

Wait, the integral ∫ from 0 to2 of [ r/(4−r²) ] dr. Let me try another substitution or see if it's improper.

Wait, when r approaches 2 from below, the denominator approaches zero. So the integrand approaches (2)/(4-4) = ∞. So the integral is improper and might diverge.

Wait, let's compute the integral. Let me write it as:

∫ [ r/(4−r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me rewrite the denominator as (2 - r)(2 + r). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps partial fractions. Let me see.

But wait, another approach: Let me write the numerator as -( (4−r²) )' / 2. Let's see:

The derivative of (4−r²) is -2r. So r = -( (4−r²) )' / 2.

So we can write [r/(4−r²)] = [ -(1/2) * d/dr (4-r²) ) ] / (4 - r²)

Which is -1/(2) * d/dr [ ln(4 - r²) ) ]

So the integral becomes:

∫ [r/(4−r²)] dr = (-1/2) ∫ [ d/dr ln(4−r²) ] dr ) = (-1/2) ln(4−r²) ) + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2, ln(4−(2)^2 )= ln(0) which tends to -infinity.

At r=0, ln(4−0) = ln(4).

So evaluating from 0 to2:

(-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (-1/2)( (-infty) - ln4 ) = (-1/2)( -infty ) = +infty.

So the integral ∫ [r/(4−r²)] dr from 0 to2 is divergent, it goes to infinity.

So the Area = 32 * [ integral from 0 to2 of r/(4−r²) dr ] * 2π.

Wait, no, wait. Let's go back.

Wait, the integral of [32/(4−r²)] * r dr from 0 to2. Which is 32 ∫ [r/(4−r²)] dr from 0 to2. But we just saw that this integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

So the area of the pseudosphere with radius 2 is infinite? But wait, pseudospheres in hyperbolic geometry have finite area, don't they? Or maybe not. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused between the hyperbolic sphere and the Euclidean pseudosphere.

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere of radius r is 4π sinh(r). Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, in hyperbolic space, the area of a sphere of radius r is 4π sinh(r). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps it's 4π sinh²(r) or something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the metric again. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 -x² -y²)] (dx² + dy²). So this is a 2D metric on the plane, but only defined inside the circle of radius 2.

But wait, what is this model? It looks like a hyperbolic metric in the Poincaré disk model. Because the Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. So comparing to our metric:

In Poincaré disk, scaling factor is 4/(1 - r²)^2. Our metric has 32/(4−r²). Hmm, not exactly the same, but perhaps a scaled version.

Wait, let's write the given denominator as 4 - r². So (4 - r²) = 4(1 - (r²/4)) = 4 (1 - (r/2)^2). So the given metric is 32 / [4(1 - (r/2)^2)] = 8 / (1 - (r/2)^2) times (dx² + dy²).

Which in polar coordinates becomes 8/(1 - (r²/4)) * r dr dθ. Wait, but that's not the same as the Poincaré disk model. The standard Poincaré disk is ds² = (4/(1-r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). So let me see: if we scale the Poincaré disk.

Let me make a substitution: let s = r/2. Then r = 2s. So dr = 2 ds. So substituting into the Poincaré metric:

ds²_poincare = (4/(1 - s²)^2) ( (2 ds)^2 + (2s)^2 dθ² )
= (4/(1-s²)^2) [4 ds² +4 s² dθ²]
= (4/(1-s²)^2) *4 [ds² + s² dθ²]
= (16/(1-s²)^2) [ds² + s² dθ²].

Hmm, comparing to our metric:

Our metric is [32/(4−r²)] (dx² + dy²) → in polar coordinates, [32/(4−r²)] r dr dθ.

Which is 32/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ.

Expressed in terms of s=r/2, r=2s, dr=2 ds.

So substituting r=2s, r dr = 2s * 2 ds =4 s ds.

Denominator: 4 - (2s)^2 =4(1 -s²).

So the expression becomes [32/(4(1 -s²)) ] * (4 s ds dθ )

Wait, let's compute:

32/(4(1 -s²)) ) * (4 s ds dθ )

= [32/(4 (1-s²))] [4 s ds dθ ]

= [8/(1-s²)] [4 s ds dθ ]

= 32 s / (1 -s²) ds dθ.

Wait, but in the Poincaré model after substitution, the metric becomes 16/(1-s²)^2 (ds² + s² dθ² ). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is a conformally flat metric with a specific function. But regardless, the key point is that the area integral diverges, because as r approaches 2, the area element becomes infinite.

So the area of the surface described by this metric is infinite. So the pseudosphere of radius 2 has infinite area.

Looking back at the options, option D is "+infty". So the correct answer would be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is defined on the domain \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2. To compute the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric, we first calculate the area element \(dA\). For a metric of the form \(ds^2 = g(x, y)(dx^2 + dy^2)\), the area element is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant of the metric tensor is \((g_{xx})(g_{yy}) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Thus, the area becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, we use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which gives \(r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du\). The limits of integration change as follows: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln(4) - \ln(0).
\]

As \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

From the given options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not the correct expression for the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
