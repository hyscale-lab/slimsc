Okay, so I've got this question here about the Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant plays a role in determining renormalizability. The basic idea is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the dimension has to be greater than or equal to a certain value, but I think more specifically, in four-dimensional spacetime, which is the usual case unless stated otherwise, the renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me break this down.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of each field and then figure out what dimension κ must have for the Lagrangian to be dimensionless (since the action is dimensionless, and the Lagrangian density has the same dimension as the action divided by volume, which in 4D is [Mass]^4 because volume is [Mass]^-4).

So, let's list the fields involved:

- ψ is a Dirac spinor. The mass dimension of a Dirac spinor in 4D is 3/2. Because in general, in D dimensions, Dirac fields have dimension (D-1)/2. So 4D: (4-1)/2=3/2.

- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Wait, actually, the σ_{μν} is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. But F^{μν} is typically for gauge fields. Wait, but in any case, for the field strength tensor F^{μν}, the dimension is [Mass]^2. Because for a gauge field like A_mu, which has a dimension of [Mass]^1, then F_{μν} = ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, which would be [Mass]^2.

Wait, let me confirm. The field strength tensor for a gauge field A_mu is F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Since A_mu has dimension [Mass]^1, each derivative ∂ brings a [Mass]. So F has dimension [Mass]^2.

Now, the term σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], which is a product of two gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless in 4D, right? Because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} is a dimensionless object.

Putting this together, let's compute the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian term.

The term is κ ψ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

So, let's compute the dimensions of each component multiplied together.

Let me first compute the dimensions of ψ σ_{μν} ψ F^{mu nu}.

Each ψ is dimension 3/2. So two ψ's would give (3/2) * 2 = 3.

σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless, so that doesn't change anything.

F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

So overall, that product has dimension 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait, no, more accurately, the term is ψ (σ F) ψ? Or wait, the term is ψ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}?

Wait, in the term, the structure is ψ multiplied by σ_{mu nu}, then multiplied by ψ, then by F^{mu nu}. But actually, the way the Lagrangian is written, it's ψ times σ_{mu nu} times ψ times F^{mu nu}, but I think the exact arrangement might matter, but probably the way it's contracted is such that the dimensions would still be the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is more like ψ γ_{mu nu} ... but regardless, the product of the fields would have certain dimensions.

Wait, let me think again: The term is κ multiplied by ψ, then σ_{mu nu} (which is a product of two gammas, so dimensionless), then ψ again, and then F^{mu nu}.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of each field's dimension multiplied together. So, each ψ is 3/2, F is 2, and σ is dimensionless. So the product is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, the term is ψ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}, so that's four factors: ψ, σ, ψ, F.

Wait, but σ is a tensor made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So:

Each ψ is 3/2. So ψ σ ψ is (3/2) * (3/2), since σ is dimensionless. So that's 9/4.

Then multiply by F^{mu nu}, which is dimension 2. So 9/4 * 2 = 9/2.

Wait, but the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over 4 dimensions. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So the term κ ψ σ ψ F must have dimension 4. So the product ψ σ ψ F has dimension (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = 9/2? Wait, no, wait: Each ψ is 3/2, σ is 0, F is 2.

So ψ * ψ = (3/2)^2 = 9/4.

Then multiplying by F gives 9/4 * 2 = 9/2.

So the entire term is κ * (9/2). For this term to have dimension 4, κ must have dimension 4 - (9/2) = (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2 ? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the term is [κ] + [ψ]^2 + [F] = 4.

Because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So [κ] + 2*(3/2) + [F] = 4.

Wait, [ψ] is 3/2, so two ψs would be 3. [F] is 2. So 3 + 2 =5. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]= 4-5 = -1. Oh wait, that makes sense.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, for renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension <=4 - (d), where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, no, more accurately, in four dimensions, a theory is renormalizable if each coupling has mass dimension >= 0. Because in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants can have positive or zero mass dimensions, but not negative.

Wait, no, I think the correct condition is that each coupling constant in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero for the theory to be renormalizable in four dimensions. Because if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, it's a nonrenormalizable interaction, which introduces higher-dimension operators. Because when you have a term with a coupling of negative mass dimension, each such term brings in higher powers of energy when quantizing, leading to nonrenormalizable divergences, requiring an infinite number of counterterms.

So here, κ has mass dimension -1, which is negative. So the theory has a dimensionful coupling, which implies it's nonrenormalizable.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because typically, the Yang-Mills theory is renormalizable, and the coupling is dimensionless. But in this case, the coupling is dimension -1. So that would make this interaction term nonrenormalizable.

So, the options are:

Option A) [κ]=-1; renormalizable. No, because κ is -1, which would make it nonrenormalizable.

Option B) [κ]=1; renormalizable. But we found [κ]=-1, so B is wrong.

Option C) [κ]=-1; not renormalizable. That matches.

Option D) [κ]=1; not renormalizable. Also wrong on the κ dimension.

So the correct answer is option C: mass dimension -1, not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $\frac{3}{2}$ in 4-dimensional spacetime.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Thus, $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of $4$ in 4-dimensional spacetime. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes as follows:
- $\bar{\psi}$ has a mass dimension of $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.

Thus, the combined dimension of $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
To ensure the Lagrangian has a total mass dimension of $4$, $\kappa$ must have a mass dimension of:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable in 4-dimensional spacetime if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions ($[\kappa]_M \geq 0$). Here, $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Step 4: Evaluate options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $\kappa$ has a negative mass dimension.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M = -1$, not $1$.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as $\kappa$ has a negative mass dimension and the theory is nonrenormalizable.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M = -1$, not $1$.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
