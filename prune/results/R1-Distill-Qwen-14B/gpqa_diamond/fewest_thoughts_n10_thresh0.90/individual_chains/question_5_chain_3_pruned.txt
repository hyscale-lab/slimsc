Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, right? Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this often relate to angular momentum, maybe spin?

The problem gives me the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them out to get a clear picture.

So, P_x is (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix with elements [0,1;1,0]. That matrix swaps the basis states. P_y is (ħ/2) times [0,-i;i,0]. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [1,0;0,-1]. Oh wait, these look familiar! They resemble the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Right, because the Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P = (ħ/2)(σ_x X + σ_y Y + σ_z Z ), since the operator is along a direction n which is a combination of x, y, z. But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means the y-component of n is zero. So the arbitrary direction is along x and z only. So the operator P must have components only in x and z, no y. So the operator would be P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ), right?

Wait, but the problem says it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is a unit vector, so n^2 = 1. So n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. But how does that affect the operator? The operator P is a vector operator, so it's the sum of P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. Therefore, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the problem says the operator is along n, so the operator is P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Because P_x is along x, etc.

So, the operator P is: P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Since n is in x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, the operator's matrix form would be (n_x multiplied by σ_x and n_z multiplied by σ_z) multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write that out. So, P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ). Substituting σ_x and σ_z:

P = (ħ/2) [n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

So putting it together, the matrix becomes:

Top row: [ (n_z) * (1) * (ħ/2), n_x * (1) * (ħ/2) ]
Bottom row: [n_x * (1)*(ħ/2), (n_z)*(-1)*(ħ/2) ]

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate. The first term is n_x [[0,1],[1,0]], which would add to n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the matrix becomes:
Top left: n_z*(1) → (n_z * 1)*(ħ/2)
Top right: n_x*(1) → (n_x *1)*(ħ/2)
Bottom left: n_x*(1) → same as top right
Bottom right: n_z*(-1)* (ħ/2)

Wait, no. Each term is multiplied by ħ/2. So the entire matrix is:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, because n_x σ_x gives [0 1; 1 0] multiplied by n_x, and n_z σ_z gives [n_z 0; 0 -n_z].

So adding them: [n_z, n_x; n_x, -n_z], then multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix is:

[[ (n_z * ħ/2 ), (n_x * ħ/2) ],
 [ (n_x * ħ/2 ), (-n_z * ħ/2) ] ]

So the operator P is this 2x2 matrix.
