Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that this has to do with the radial velocity method for detecting exoplanets. Hmm, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, same star masses, same planet masses, but different Doppler shifts.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So, we need to find Period2 / Period1.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is the Doppler shift (delta lambda) over lambda is equal to the velocity (v) over c. So delta lambda / lambda = v/c. But since the actual shift is given in milliangstroms, maybe we can just compare the velocities.

Since the stars have the same mass, and the planets have the same mass, I think the velocity of the star (v) is what's causing the Doppler shift. The velocity of the star depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the distance between them. Oh wait, maybe the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula becomes:

v ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, the numerator (M_p) is the same for both. The denominator will be same for both stars because M_star is same. So the velocity v is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because if v is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then higher v means shorter period, and lower v means longer period.

Wait, because v is inversely proportional to cube root of P. So, if planet #2 has a lower velocity (smaller shift?), no wait, wait. Wait the shift is 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Wait, planet #1's shift is 5, and planet #2's shift is 7. So planet #2's star is moving more—so higher velocity. So because v is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), higher v implies shorter P.

But wait, let me think again. The formula says v is proportional to (M_p / M_star) ) * (P)^( -1/3 ). So same M_p and M_star. So v is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So P is proportional to 1/(v)^3.

So planet #1 has a velocity of 5, planet #2 has 7. So v2 = 7/5 * v1. Because since the Doppler shift is linear with velocity, 5 and 7 are in the same units. So the velocity is directly proportional to the shift, assuming same spectral line and same setup.

Wait, that's a key point. Since the same spectral line is being observed, the wavelength shift is related to the velocity. So if planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 causes 7, then v2 = (7/5) v1.

So since velocity is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (v)^-3.

So let me write it down.

v ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

So P ∝ 1/(v)^3.

So P2 / P1 = (v1 / v2)^3.

Because since v2 = (7/5) v1,

v1/v2 = 5/7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. So planet #2 has a shorter period than planet #1.

Wait, but the question says how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer? So 0.3
