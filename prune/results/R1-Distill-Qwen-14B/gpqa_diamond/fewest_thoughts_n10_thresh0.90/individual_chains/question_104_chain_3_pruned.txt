Okay, let's try to tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So the star moves back and forth, and we detect this movement through the shift in spectral lines.

The setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune, so I'm guessing that's about a tenth or so of Jupiter's mass. Both planets have circular orbits, so eccentricity isn't a factor here.

The key data given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms (I think 1e-3 of an angstrom), and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, but what determines the RV shift? I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity. The velocity amplitude (K) depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit (but since both are detected, I assume the inclination is the same, maybe close to 90 degrees, so we can ignore it for this comparison).

The formula I think is K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * (1 day)^(-1)) ) )^(1/3). Wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler relation when the star's mass is much larger than the planet's. Since the planets are Neptune-like, their masses are much smaller than the Sun-like stars, so M_star >> M_planet. Therefore, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * (P^(1/3) ) ) )

But since the masses of the stars are the same and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), and I think the sini term is the same as well (assuming same inclination, which is a fair assumption since both are detected), maybe the ratio of K relates to the inverse cube root of the period.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the formula again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ). So K ∝ (M_planet) / (P^(1/3) ), since M_star is the same for both stars.

But in this problem, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_planet is the same for both. Therefore, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, but in the problem, the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, so the only difference is their orbital periods and the resulting RV shifts.

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, wait, let me get that right. Since K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)), and M_p is the same for both planets, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )^{-1}, or K1 = (P2/P1)^{-1/3} * K2. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of K and P.

Wait, I think the correct formula is K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And e is zero because the orbits are circular, so (1 - e²) is 1. So it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, let me correct that.

Wait, another approach: the RV amplitude K can be approximated as:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the equation for K. The formula I remember is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (c) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now. Let me think again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ]

But since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So it becomes:

K ≈ [ (2π G)^(1/3) / (c P
