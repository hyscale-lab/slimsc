Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y, releasing a gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. The goal is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I need to identify what X, Y, W, G, and B are. The question mentions that X is a substance known for incorporating a heavier isotope. That makes me think it could be something like hydrogen, but maybe not. Wait, another clue: the product with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like acetic acid, which has a carbonyl group (COO-) and a carboxylic acid group. When they react with something, perhaps a base, but in this case, X is reacting with Y, which is a liquid. 

Wait, maybe X is a metal? Let's think about the reaction. X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So, the gas is probably something like H2, but H2's molecule has 2 H atoms. Each H is 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so for each molecule, protons=2, neutrons=0, which is not equal. Wait, that doesn't fit. Another possibility is O2? Let's see: Oxygen has 8 protons. O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons (since each O atom has 8 neutrons in the common isotope). So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits—same number. So gas W is O2?

But wait, what reaction between a metal and a liquid produces O2? Maybe it's a reaction between a metal and an acid. Like, if Y is an acid, and X is a metal that reacts to produce hydrogen gas. Wait, but earlier I thought W was O2, which would require a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe Y is water? Because metals reacting with water can produce H2 gas. But then W would be H2, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Which substance has a melting point near there? Maybe something like water (0 C), but that's too low. Or perhaps something else. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm. Maybe B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl melts higher. Or maybe it's something like ammonium chloride? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is a base or an acid. Let me think.

Wait, if G is a precipitate that releases B upon heating. Suppose G is a hydroxide. Heating a hydroxide might decompose it. For example, if G is Cu(OH)2, heating it would produce CuO and water. But that wouldn't give a substance with a melting point near 4°C. Alternatively, maybe B is a carbonate? No, that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought. What if G is a carbonate? Heating it might release CO2 and form something else. But I'm not getting it. Maybe B is a metal oxide. Not sure yet.

Let me think about the initial reaction: X reacts with Y violently, releasing O2. That makes me think of a metal reacting with an acid to produce hydrogen gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is a strong base, like NaOH, and X is a salt that reacts to produce gas. Or perhaps X is a metal that reacts with water to produce H2, but that doesn't fit with W being O2.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let me go back to the reaction. X is a substance that, when reacted with Y, releases gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for W's molecule, number of protons = number of neutrons. Let's think of possible gases. O2: each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That matches. So gas W is O2. So the reaction produces O2 gas.

What reactions produce O2? Decomposition of a peroxide, maybe. Or perhaps the reaction is between a metal and an acid, but that usually produces H2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a peroxide, and X is a metal that reacts with it to produce O2. Wait, but metals reacting with peroxides can produce O2. For example, sodium reacts with water to produce H2, but other metals might react differently. Let me think—maybe X is sodium and Y is water? No, sodium reacting with water produces H2, not O2. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a salt solution, like a salt that can form a peroxide. Or perhaps Y is something like hydrogen peroxide. If X is a metal, maybe it reacts with H2O2. For example, sodium reacts with H2O2, but under what conditions? Alternatively, maybe X is a metal that reacts with a strong acid to produce O2. I'm not too sure, but maybe I'm going down the wrong path here.

Let me think about the product of a keto acid with X. The product contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. Keto acids have a carbonyl group, so perhaps the reaction is something like an esterification or perhaps a reaction where X deprotonates the keto acid, producing a salt and water. For example, if X is a base, maybe a hydroxide. Wait, but then the product would have O from the hydroxide. Or perhaps X is something like NaOH reacting with a keto acid like acetic acid. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na+) and water. The product (sodium acetate) has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. So that fits the description: the product has two oxygen atoms.

So if X is NaOH, then Y might be something else. Wait, but the initial reaction: X reacts with Y violently, releasing O2. Wait, if X is NaOH, what could Y be? Maybe Y is a carbonate, but that would produce CO2 and water, not O2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a peroxide. Like, Y is H2O2. Then, NaOH reacting with H2O2 might produce O2 gas. Let me check: NaOH + H2O2 → NaO2 + H2O. Wait, no, perhaps under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where NaOH is heated with something else to produce O2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal like magnesium, which reacts with a liquid Y (like water) but doesn't produce O2. Wait, Mg reacts with water (especially if it's hot or in presence of acid) to produce H2. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the product with a keto acid has two O atoms. So if X is NaOH, then reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would produce a product with two O's (like sodium acetate). So that fits.

Then, the initial reaction: X (NaOH) reacts with Y (maybe a peroxide like H2O2) to release O2. Let's see: NaOH + H2O2 → NaO2 (sodium peroxide) + H2O. But wait, does this reaction produce O2? Let me think. The reaction of NaOH with H2O2 can produce O2 under certain conditions, perhaps when heated. The balanced equation would be: 2 NaOH + H2O2 → Na2O2 + H2O. But wait, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) doesn't produce O2 directly. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate, but that would produce CO2, not O2. Hmm.

Wait, let me approach this differently. What if X is a carbonate? No, because then Y would be something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the precipitate G: when heated, releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4°C. What's a common substance with a melting point around there? Water is 0°C, but maybe something else. Wait, ammonium nitrate has a melting point around 169°C, so that's not it. Sodium nitrate's melting point is higher. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl's melting point is way higher, around 801°C. Hmm.

Wait, what about something like ice? But 277 K is 4°C, which is just above ice's melting point. So if B is water (H2O), which melts at 0°C, but we're talking about the melting point under normal conditions. Wait, but the melting point of H2O is 273 K (0°C). 277 K is a bit higher, so perhaps it's another substance.

Wait, maybe B is something else. Let's think about the possible elements in X. The question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X must be a compound where one of its elements can have isotopes, like hydrogen (with deuterium as a heavier isotope), or oxygen (with O-18), or something else.

If X is sodium hydroxide (NaOH), then the elements are Na, O, H. Sodium could have isotopes, but the heavier isotopes are less common. Hydrogen could have deuterium. So if X is NaOH, then the heavier isotope could be deuterium. But the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope, so perhaps it's a compound where one element is present in a heavy isotope.

But let's think about the reaction. If X is NaOH, and Y is something like H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), then the reaction would be: 2 NaOH + H2O2 → Na2O2 + H2O. But Na2O2 is a solid, so maybe that's the precipitate G. Then, when G (sodium peroxide) is heated, what happens? Sodium peroxide decomposes when heated, right? The reaction is 2 Na2O2 → 2 Na2O + O2. So when heated, sodium peroxide decomposes to sodium oxide and O2. So B would be O2, but O2 is a gas, not a solid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is sodium carbonate? No, because the reaction of NaOH with Y (maybe CO2) would give Na2CO3, which is a precipitate. Then heating Na2CO3 would decompose into Na2O and CO2. But B would be CO2, which is a gas, but in the question, B is a product when heated. Alternatively, maybe I'm off track.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal. Let's think about metals reacting with acid. For example, magnesium reacting with hydrochloric acid to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, and heat. But earlier, the gas W was O2, so that might not fit.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So, maybe X is a base. If X is Mg(OH)2, reacting with a keto acid like acetic acid would produce magnesium acetate and water. Magnesium acetate has two oxygen atoms per formula unit? Let me see: Mg(CH3COO)2. Each acetate has two O's, so the formula is Mg(C2H3O2)2. So each molecule has four O's in total (two from each acetate group). Wait, but the product has two O atoms. Hmm, maybe it's a different base.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH. Reacting NaOH with acetic acid gives sodium acetate and water. Sodium acetate (CH3COONa) has two O's in the acetate ion. So the product has two O atoms in the formula unit. That fits the description. So X could be NaOH.

Now, going back to the reaction: X (NaOH) reacts with Y (what could Y be?) to produce O2 gas. Wait, under what conditions does NaOH react to produce O2? Perhaps Y is H2O2. Let me think about their reaction. NaOH and H2O2 can react to form sodium peroxide (Na2O2) and water. The reaction is:

2 NaOH + H2O2 → Na2O2 + H2O

But does this reaction release O2? I don't think so. Sodium peroxide doesn't release O2 upon formation. Unless the reaction is decomposition of Na2O2.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Another possibility: Y is a carbonate. But that would release CO2, not O2.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that releases O2 when reacting with a base. Not sure.

Wait, but let's think about the precipitate G. If Y is H2O2, then the product is Na2O2, which is a white solid (sodium peroxide), which could be the precipitate G. Then, when G is heated, it decomposes into sodium oxide and O2. So, 2 Na2O2 → 2 Na2O + O2. So upon heating, G (Na2O2) releases O2 (gas W), and leaves behind B, which is Na2O. Wait, but what's the melting point of Na2O? Sodium oxide (Na2O) has a melting point around 1260°C, which is way higher than 277 K (4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe my initial assumption about X is wrong. Let me think again.

Another approach: The product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's think of X as something that when reacts with a keto acid, which is a carboxylic acid with a ketone group, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: X could be a metal. If X is a metal, then reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would produce a salt. For example, Mg + 2 CH3COOH → Mg(CH3COO)2 + H2. But this product, magnesium acetate, has four oxygen atoms per formula unit. So that doesn't fit the two O's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate. No, because then reacting with an acid would release CO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is something else. Let's think again about the reaction that produces O2. What reactions produce O2 gas? Decomposition of KClO3 upon heating (but that's with a catalyst), or electrolysis of water. Or maybe the decomposition of a peroxide under heat.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction between X and Y is a decomposition reaction. For example, X is a peroxide, and Y is a catalyst that causes it to decompose into O2. But then Y would be a solid catalyst, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a peroxide, and X is a metal that reacts to produce O2. For example, sodium reacting with hydrogen peroxide in acidic conditions can produce O2, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a nitric acid, but that usually produces NO or other gases, not O2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the elements present in X.

The question says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X must consist of at least two different elements, with varying isotopes. One of them must have a heavier isotope incorporated into X.

Earlier, I thought X might be NaOH, which has Na, O, H. Sodium has isotopes (like Na-23, Na-24, etc.), but the heavier isotopes are rare. Hydrogen has deuterium as a heavier isotope. So, if X is NaOH and contains deuterium, then the elements present are Na, O, H (with some being deuterium). The lightest element is hydrogen (atomic mass ~1) and the heaviest is sodium (atomic mass ~23). So the sum would be 24. But looking at the options, option B is 25, which is close but not exactly 24.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let's think of another compound. What if X is something like NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide)? But that's not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), but then the reaction with Y would be different. Let's think about the product with a keto acid. Na2CO3 reacting with, say, acetic acid would produce sodium acetate, carbon dioxide, and water. The product (sodium acetate) has two O's, which fits. So, the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + 2 CH3COOH → 2 CH3COONa + CO2↑ + H2O

So the product, sodium acetate, has two O's. That fits the description. Now, let's think about the initial reaction: X (Na2CO3) reacts with Y (maybe HCl) to produce CO2, but the gas W is supposed to be O2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because reacting sodium carbonate with acid produces CO2, not O2. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a strong base, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is not a carbonate but something else. Let's think about another possibility: X is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Reacting it with a strong acid would produce CO2 and water. But again, W would be CO2, not O2. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of a different approach. Let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C, which is just above the melting point of water (273 K). So perhaps B is a substance that's just above the melting point. Alternatively, maybe it's a different form of water, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: what if B is a different compound, like ammonium chloride? No, ammonium chloride's melting point is higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium chloride, but that's much higher.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G is a carbonate. Heating a carbonate would produce CO2 and a metal oxide. But then, B is the metal oxide. Let's say it's sodium oxide (Na2O). The melting point of Na2O is around 1390°C, which is way higher than 277 K, so that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. Heating a hydroxide would produce an oxide and water. For example, heating copper hydroxide produces copper oxide and water. But that doesn't fit with the melting point of B.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think about substances that have a melting point of around 277 K. Hmm, 277 K is 4°C, which is just above the freezing point of water. What about camphor? No, camphor has a higher melting point. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound altogether. Let me think: what is a gas with the same number of protons and neutrons? Earlier, I thought O2. So gas W is O2.

So, the reaction between X and Y produces O2. Let me think of a reaction that produces O2. One possibility is the decomposition of potassium chlorate (KClO3) with a catalyst, but that's a thermal decomposition. But Y is a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, the reaction could be between a peroxide and an acid. For example, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposes into water and O2. But I'm not sure how X would fit into that.

Wait, perhaps X is a peroxide, and Y is an acid. For example, X is H2O2, Y is sulfuric acid. The reaction might be H2O2 + H2SO4 → H2O + O2 + SO4. But I'm not certain about this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide and Y is a base. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to make a list of possible compounds for X.

Another approach: think about the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

So, possible pairs of elements:

- Lightest: O (16), heaviest: Na (23) → 16 + 23 = 39. Not an option.

- Lightest: H (1), heaviest: Na (23) → 24. Closest is option B (25), but not exact.

- Lightest: C (12), heaviest: O (16) → 28. No option for that.

Wait, but maybe X has two elements: like H and O. For example, H2O. But H2O doesn't incorporate a heavier isotope in a way that would be called out. Wait, heavy water is D2O, but the substance X is incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So if X is H2O, but some H atoms are deuterium. Then, the elements are H and O. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps
