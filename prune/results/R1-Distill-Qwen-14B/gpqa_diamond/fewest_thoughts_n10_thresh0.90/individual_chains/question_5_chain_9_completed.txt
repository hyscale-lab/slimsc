Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along a certain direction n. The direction is in the x-z plane, which probably means that the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, and phi, the azimuthal angle, would be zero because it's in the x-z plane. But wait, the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so maybe phi isn't necessarily zero? Hmm, no, wait. The direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, which implies that its y-component is zero. So the direction vector can be represented as (sin(theta) cos(phi), 0, sin(theta) sin(phi)) but since it's in the x-z plane, phi is zero or pi? Wait, actually, any angle in the x-z plane would have a phi of 0 or 180 degrees because that's where the y-component is zero. So maybe the direction is along (x,z) with phi = 0.

But wait, the eigenvector is for the operator P, which is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. The problem states that the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator P is actually the component of the momentum operator along n.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum or momentum operators are given in terms of their respective components. So the total operator P would be the sum of the components along each axis multiplied by the direction vector. That is, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the question is about an eigenvalue of +ħ/2. So the operator P has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, similar to spin-1/2 systems. The eigenvectors would then be the spin-up and spin-down states along the direction n.

So, the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of the operator P (which is n_x P_x + n_z P_z) for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The eigenvector will be a spinor in two dimensions, and we need to find its components.

Wait, but let's think about the components. The given matrices are for the components Px, Py, and Pz. Let me write them down:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

These are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, yes, because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, which for spin-1/2 systems are used in the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z as S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i. So P here is similar to the spin operator.

So the operator P along n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) = (n_x (σx) + n_z (σz)) * ħ/2.

Wait, let's correct that. The operator P is the component along n, so P = n · P, where P is the vector of operators. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

But what are the values of n_x and n_z? Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, we can parametrize it using an angle theta from the z-axis. So n_x = sin(theta) and n_z = cos(theta). Because in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z plane would have phi=0 or pi, but since it's arbitrary, let's take phi=0 for simplicity.

So, P = [sin(theta) * P_x + cos(theta) * P_z] * (ħ/2). Wait, no. Wait, each component Px, Py, Pz is already multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P along n is P = (n_x * σx + n_z * σz) * (ħ/2). Because P_x is (ħ/2) σx, and similarly for others. So P = (n_x σx + n_z σz) * (ħ/2).

So the matrix for P becomes (ħ/2) times [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, the σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So combining them with coefficients n_x and n_z, the matrix for P is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

We are to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b].

So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Substituting, (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can cancel (ħ/2) from both sides, so we get the matrix equation:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives two equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a

n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me write these equations:

1. (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

2. n_x a + ( -n_z - 1 ) b = 0

So, equation 1: a (n_z -1) + b n_x = 0

Equation 2: a n_x + b (-n_z -1) = 0

We can solve these equations. Let me write them as:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b

n_x a = (n_z + 1) b

Let me consider equation 1: a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Substituting into equation 2: n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] = (n_z +1 ) b

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

n_x (-n_x) b = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) b

Simplify:

- n_x^2 b = (n_z^2 -1) b

But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So n_z^2 =1 - n_x^2.

Substituting into the equation:

- n_x^2 b = ( (1 - n_x^2 ) -1 ) b

Simplify RHS: (1 - n_x^2 -1 ) = -n_x^2. So,

- n_x^2 b = (-n_x^2) b

Which gives 0=0, so the two equations are dependent. So, the eigenvectors are determined up to a scaling factor.

So, from equation 2: n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = [ (n_z +1) / n_x ] b, assuming n_x is not zero.

But wait, if n_x is zero, then the direction is along z, which is a possible case. Hmm, but in the general case, let's proceed.

So, a = [ (n_z +1) / n_x ] b

Let me represent the eigenvector as [a; b] = b [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ]^T

But since it's an eigenvector, we can choose b=1, but we need to normalize it.

Wait, the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So, a = [ (n_z +1) / n_x ] b.

So, |a|^2 + |b|^2 = | (n_z +1)^2 / n_x^2 + 1 | |b|^2 =1.

Wait, substituting a = k b, where k = (n_z +1)/n_x.

So, |k|^2 |b|^2 + |b|^2 =1 → |b|^2 ( |k|^2 +1 ) =1 → |b|=1/√( |k|^2 +1 )

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Let me compute |k|^2 = (n_z +1)^2 / n_x^2.

So,

|k|^2 +1 = [ (n_z +1)^2 + n_x^2 ] / n_x^2

Expand numerator:

(n_z^2 + 2 n_z +1 + n_x^2 ) = (n_z^2 + n_x^2) + 2 n_z +1.

But n_z^2 +n_x^2 =1.

So numerator becomes 1 + 2n_z +1 = 2(1 + n_z )

So |k|^2 +1 = [2(1 +n_z ) ] / n_x^2.

Thus, |b| = sqrt( n_x^2 / [2(1 +n_z ) ] )

Wait, because |b|=1/√( [2(1 +n_z)]/n_x^2 )= n_x / sqrt( 2(1 +n_z ) )

But wait, let me double-check that.

Given |k|^2 +1 = [2(1+n_z)]/n_x^2.

So 1/( |k|^2 +1 ) = n_x^2 / [2(1 +n_z ) ]

So |b|= sqrt( n_x^2 / [2(1 +n_z ) ] )

Which is |n_x| / sqrt(2(1 +n_z ) )

But since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n_x is positive (assuming direction is in the positive x direction), so |n_x|=n_x.

So,

|b|= n_x / sqrt( 2 (1 +n_z ) )

And a = (n_z +1)/n_x * |b|.

So,

a = (n_z +1)/n_x * [n_x / sqrt( 2 (1 +n_z ) ) ] = (n_z +1) * [1 / sqrt( 2 (1 +n_z ) ) ]

Simplify:

a = sqrt( (n_z +1) ) / sqrt( 2 )

Because (n_z +1) / sqrt( (n_z +1) * something )

Wait, let me compute:

(n_z +1) / sqrt(2 (n_z +1) ) ) = sqrt( (n_z +1) ) / sqrt(2 )

So,

a = sqrt( (n_z +1) / 2 )

b = n_x / sqrt( 2 (1 +n_z ) )

But n_x is sqrt(1 - n_z^2 ), since n_x^2 +n_z^2=1 → n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z^2 )

So,

b = sqrt(1 - n_z^2 ) / sqrt( 2 (1 +n_z ) )

Let me factor sqrt(1 -n_z^2 ) as sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) )

So,

b = sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) / sqrt( 2 (1 +n_z) ) ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z) ) / sqrt(2 )

Thus,

a = sqrt( (1 +n_z ) / 2 )

b = sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / 2 )

So the eigenvector is [ a, b ]^T = [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T.

But wait, the eigenvector I found is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So what's the physical meaning here?

Wait, in the case when the direction is along z (n_z=1, n_x=0), the eigenvector should be [1, 0], which matches a = sqrt( (1+1)/2 )=1, b=0. Similarly, if the direction is along x (n_z=0, n_x=1), the eigenvector is [ sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2) ].

Wait, but when the direction is along x, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and the eigenvector should be (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Hmm, but in that case, what about phase factors? Because the eigenvectors can have a global phase, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are defined up to a phase.

Wait, but in the case where n_x is positive, the eigenvector's components are positive. But if the direction is along negative x, would the eigenvector have a different phase? Hmm, perhaps not, because the eigenvalue is positive.

Alternatively, sometimes the eigenvectors are written with a global phase, but in this case, I think the phase would be positive.

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T.

But wait, n_z is the z-component of the direction vector. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_z can be written as cos(theta), where theta is the angle from the z-axis. So, n_z = cos(theta), and n_x = sin(theta).

So substituting n_z = cos(theta), the eigenvector becomes:

a= sqrt( (1 + cos(theta) ) / 2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

b= sqrt( (1 - cos(theta) ) / 2 ) = sin(theta/2 )

Because using the trigonometric identity: cos^2(theta/2) = (1 + cos(theta))/2, and sin^2(theta/2)=(1 - cos(theta))/2.

Wait, that's right. So the eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, we have an overall factor of sqrt(ħ) in the options. Wait, looking back at the problem, the components of P are given as (ħ/2) times the matrices. So the eigenvector is a spinor, and the components are unitless? Wait, no, the eigenvectors are vectors in a Hilbert space and are normalized, but their components are complex numbers, not necessarily involving ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches what I have. But wait, the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P, which is along n, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenvector components don't have ħ in them because they're just the components of a vector. So the eigenvector should be as I found.

But looking at the options, option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ). So that seems to match.

Wait, but the problem is about the operator P, which is in the same form as the spin operator. So yes, the eigenvector should be the same as the spin-up state along direction n, which is given by (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)) ).

Wait, but in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane. So phi=0, so the second component would just be sin(theta/2), not multiplied by e^{i phi}.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Which matches option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is similar to spherical harmonics but not the same as the spinor components. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I have.

So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, let me recheck. The options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

So option C is the one that matches our calculated eigenvector.

Wait, but what about normalization? The vector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] is already normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1. So that's correct.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are given in terms of $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $n_y = 0$, and the direction can be parametrized using an angle $\theta$ from the z-axis, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$.

The operator $P$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 
n_z & n_x \\ 
n_x & -n_z 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]

where $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P$ into the eigenvalue equation and solving the resulting system of equations, we find that the eigenvector components satisfy:

\[
a = \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}}, \quad b = \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}.
\]

Using the parametrization $n_z = \cos\theta$ and $n_x = \sin\theta$, the eigenvector becomes:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 
\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ 
\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — This does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ — This is not the correct form for the eigenvector in this context.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — This matches the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — This does not match the derived eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
