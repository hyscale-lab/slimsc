Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime is dilated due to their high speed, so we have to consider time dilation from special relativity. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle, but when it's moving, the lifetime appears longer, which is called the dilated lifetime.

The formula for time dilation is tau = gamma * tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to E/(m c²), I think. Wait, but energy E here is probably the total energy of the particle. So, E = gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, in particle physics, energies are often given in units where c=1, so maybe the calculation is simpler.

Wait, the mass is given as 3.41 GeV. So, m c² would be 3.41 GeV. Energy E is 27 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41.

Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87. 3.41 times 7.9 is 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41*0.9=3.069, so total 26.939, which is close to 27. So gamma is approximately 7.9.

Wait, so gamma is about 7.9. So the dilated lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0. tau_0 is 8e-16 s. So tau is 7.9 * 8e-16 = approx 6.32e-15 seconds.

Wait, but why do we need the dilated lifetime? Oh, because in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so the lifetime is longer, so it can travel a longer distance before decaying. The distance it travels is the mean path length, which is velocity multiplied by the lifetime.

But wait, to find the minimum resolution, which I think refers to the detection resolution, so the minimum distance we can detect the decay products. Or wait, maybe it's the minimum distance the particle must travel so that we can observe the decay. Because if the particle decays too close to the source, perhaps we can't resolve the two decay points, Y and Z, so we need the decay to happen far enough apart such that we can distinguish the two tracks.

Wait, the problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think that's about the minimum distance between the decay products that the detector can resolve. If the decay products are too close together, the detector can't tell they're separate, so we have to have a minimum distance for 30% of the decays to be resolvable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimum path length the particle travels so that there's enough space between the decay products. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to think.

Wait, but the question is more about the minimum resolution, which is probably the minimum distance the decay must occur from the origin for it to be observed. Or perhaps it's the minimum distance between the two decay products so that we can distinguish them.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the proper decay length. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap the problem.

The problem is about the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think that refers to the minimum distance the particle can travel before decaying, such that 30% of the decays are within that distance, allowing us to observe them. Or perhaps the opposite: the minimum distance the particle must travel so that 30% of the decays are beyond that, meaning that we can observe them.

Wait, perhaps it's about the decay length. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula for the decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Because L is velocity (beta c) multiplied by the lifetime (gamma tau_0). So L = beta c gamma tau_0.

But I might need to calculate the decay length and then find what fraction of decays occur beyond a certain length. Because the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0. So the average lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. The average distance the particle travels is L = beta gamma c tau_0.

So first, let's compute gamma. As before, gamma = E/(m c^2). E is 27 GeV, m c^2 is 3.41 GeV, so gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918.

Now, we need beta. Beta is v/c, and beta can be found from gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). For large gamma, beta is approximately 1, but let's compute it exactly.

gamma is about 7.918, so gamma squared is about 62.72. So 1/gamma² is about 0.01594. So 1 - 0.01594 is 0.98406. Square root of that is about 0.9920 (since 0.992^2 = 0.984064). So beta is approximately 0.992.

So beta is approximately 0.992. So beta c is 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Now, the decay length L is beta * gamma * c * tau_0.

Let me compute that.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds.

So L = 0.992 * 7.918 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Wait, let's compute it step by step.

First, compute beta * gamma = 0.992 * 7.918 ≈ 7.86.

Then, c * tau_0 is 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s = 2.4e-7 meters.

So L = 7.86 * 2.4e-7 m = approx 1.886e-6 meters.

Wait, approximately 1.886e-6 meters, which is 1.886 micrometers.

But the options are in the 2e-6, 2e-9, etc. So the closest would be option A, 2.08e-6 m.

But wait, why do I think that's the correct approach? Because I'm calculating the average decay length. But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, perhaps that's the minimum length the particle must travel so that 30% of the decays occur beyond that point. So we need to find the distance L where 30% of the decays have occurred beyond L.

Wait, the decay process follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a decay occurs after time t is P(t) = e^(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

But since we're dealing with distances, perhaps it's better to use the decay length L as a function of the proper lifetime.

The decay probability as a function of distance x is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/L_avg), where L_avg is the average decay length.

Wait, no, actually, the probability that the decay occurs beyond a certain distance x is P(x) = e^(-x/(L_avg)). Because the average decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0. So the decay probability is P = e^(-x/(L_avg)).

We need to find x such that P(x) = 0.3 (30% of decays occur beyond x), so 1 - P(x) = 0.7. Because 70% of decays have occurred before x, and 30% after.

Wait, actually, no, because P(x) represents the probability that the decay occurs beyond x. So if we want at least 30% of the decays to be beyond x, then P(x) = 0.3.

So, 0.3 = e^(-x/(L_avg)).

Solving for x: ln(0.3) = -x/(L_avg) → x = - L_avg ln(0.3).

Compute ln(0.3): ln(0.3) ≈ -1.20397.

So x = L_avg * 1.20397.

So x is approximately 1.204 times the average decay length.

Earlier, I calculated L_avg as about 1.886e-6 meters. So multiplying by 1.204: 1.886e-6 * 1.204 ≈ 2.274e-6 meters.

Wait, but the options are 2.08e-6, which is about 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, but my calculation gives approximately 2.27e-6 m. That doesn't match exactly. Did I make a mistake in my approach?

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the proper decay length and not the average. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: the proper lifetime is tau_0. The lifetime observed in the lab is gamma tau_0. The average path length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

But perhaps the formula for the number of decays is N = N0 (1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau_0))) ), where t is the time. But since t in the lab frame relates to the distance, x = beta gamma c tau_0 * t (wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here).

Alternatively, the distance x is beta c tau * gamma, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: The probability that a particle decays beyond a certain length x is P = e^(-x/L_avg), where L_avg is the mean decay length.

We want P = 0.3, so x = -L_avg ln(0.3).

We have L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

So let me recompute L_avg accurately.

Gamma = E/(m c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 27 /3.41 ≈ 7.918.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/7.918)^2 )= sqrt(1 - (1/62.72)) ≈ sqrt(0.98406) ≈ 0.99202.

So beta ≈ 0.99202.

So beta gamma = 0.99202 *7.918 ≈ 7.866.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 = 8e-16 s.

So L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0 = 7.866 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Compute that:

3e8 * 8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7 m.

Then multiply by 7.866: 2.4e-7 *7.866 ≈ 1.8878e-6 meters.

So L_avg ≈ 1.8878e-6 m.

Now, x = L_avg * ln(1/0.3) ≈ 1.8878e-6 * 1.20397 ≈ 2.273e-6 meters.

But the options are 2.08e-6 m (option A), and another option is 2.08e-9 m, which is much smaller.

Hmm, wait, why is my result 2.27e-6 meters, but the options don't have that. Closest is option A which is 2.08e-6 m. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it more precisely.

Compute gamma: 27 / 3.41 = ?

3.41 *7 is 23.87. 3.41 *7.9 is 3.41*(7+0.9)=23.87 +3.069=26.939. That's 7.9 gives 26.939, which is just under 27. So 27 /3.41 is approximately 7.918.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/7.918)^2 )= sqrt(1 - 1/(62.72))= sqrt( (62.72-1)/62.72 )= sqrt(61.72/62.72) = sqrt(0.98406)= approx 0.99202.

So beta gamma = 0.99202 * 7.918 ≈ 7.918 *0.99202 ≈ let's calculate:

7 * 0.99202 = 6.94414,

0.918 *0.99202 ≈ 0.918 * 1 = 0.918, minus 0.918 *0.00798 ≈ 0.0073. So around 0.9107.

So total beta gamma ≈ 6.94414 + 0.9107 ≈ 7.8548.

So beta gamma is approximately 7.8548.

Now, L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

c tau_0 is 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s = 2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by beta gamma: 7.8548 * 2.4e-7 = let's compute that.

7 * 2.4e-7 = 1.68e-6,

0.8548 * 2.4e-7 ≈ 2.0515e-7.

So total L_avg ≈ 1.68e-6 + 2.05e-7 = 1.885e-6 m.

Same as before.

Now, x = L_avg * ln(1/0.3) = 1.885e-6 * 1.20397 = let's compute.

1.885e-6 *1.2 is about 2.262e-6.

But more accurately, 1.885 * 1.20397 = ?

1.885 *1.2 = 2.262,

1.885 * 0.00397 ≈ 0.00745.

So total x ≈ 2.262 + 0.00745 ≈ 2.269e-6 m.

So x is approximately 2.269e-6 meters, or 2.269 micrometers.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, that's about 2.08 micrometers. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma = 27 /3.41 exactly.

Wait, 3.41 * 7.918 is 27? Let me compute 3.41 *7.918.

3.41 *7 = 23.87.

3.41 *0.918 = ?

0.9 *3.41 = 3.069,

0.018 *3.41 = 0.06138,

So 3.069 +0.06138=3.13038.

So 23.87 +3.13038=27.00038, which is approximately 27.

So gamma is exactly 7.918. So that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of beta is a bit off. Let me compute beta more accurately.

Gamma = 7.918 → gamma squared is 7.918^2. Let's compute that:

7.918 *7.918.

7 *7=49,

7 *0.918 = 6.426,

0.918 *7=6.426,

0.918 *0.918≈0.8427.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 7.918^2.

= (7 + 0.918)^2 = 49 + 2*7*0.918 + (0.918)^2.

=49 + 12.852 + 0.8427.

49 + 12.852 =61.852 +0.8427=62.6947.

So gamma squared is approximately 62.6947.

So 1/gamma^2 is 1/62.6947 ≈ 0.015955.

So 1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 - 0.015955= 0.984045.

Beta = sqrt(0.984045) = ?

Let me compute sqrt(0.984045).

I know that sqrt(0.98) is approximately 0.98995.

Wait, 0.992^2 = (0.99)^2 + 2*(0.99)(0.002) + (0.002)^2=0.9801 +0.00396 +0.000004=0.984064.

Wait, that's exactly 0.984064.

So beta is 0.992, because (0.992)^2 = 0.984064, which matches our 0.984045 pretty well. So beta is 0.992.

So beta gamma is 0.992 *7.918 = let's calculate:

7.918 *0.992.

Compute 7.918 * 1 =7.918.

Minus 7.918 *0.008=0.063344.

So 7.918 -0.063344 =7.854656.

So beta gamma is 7.854656.

Then, L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

c tau_0 is 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s= 2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by beta gamma: 7.854656 * 2.4e-7 = ?

7 *2.4e-7 = 1.68e-6.

0.854656 *2.4e-7 = 0.854656 *2.4=2.0511744e-7.

So 1.68e-6 + 2.0511744e-7 = 1.68e-6 + 0.20511744e-6 = 1.88511744e-6 m.

So L_avg is approximately 1.885e-6 m.

x = L_avg * ln(1/0.3) = 1.885e-6 * 1.20397 ≈ 2.27e-6 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, what if the question is asking for the minimum resolution, which is the distance that 30% of the decays occur beyond. So perhaps the x is the length where 30% of the decays have occurred beyond x. So 30% of the decays are beyond x.

Wait, the formula for P(x) is the probability that the decay occurs beyond x, which is e^(-x/L_avg).

So to
