Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made of a quark and an antiquark. But I'm a bit rusty on the details, so let me think about what the question is asking.

The question is about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to compute this mean decay distance and pick the correct option.

Wait, how do I find the mean decay distance? I think it's related to the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the mean decay distance would be the product of the particle's speed and its lifetime. So distance = v * τ. But how do I find τ?

I remember the uncertainty principle or maybe the relation involving the width Γ. Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, which means τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

So, the lifetime τ is Planck's constant over the width. Once I have τ, I need to find the particle's velocity. Wait, but how do I get the velocity? I know the energy E and mass m, so I can find the velocity from relativistic equations.

Hmm, the energy E is given as 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So, the particle is moving at relativistic speeds. Let me think about the relativistic energy formula: E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So, γ = E / (m c²). Let me compute that. But wait, the units for E and m are in GeV. Wait, perhaps I should convert them into more standard units like Joules? Or maybe I can work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, since all units are in GeV, maybe I can compute γ directly without converting units. Let's see.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So, γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but in natural units (where c=1), E (in GeV) is equal to m c² (since m is in GeV/c², multiplied by c² gives GeV). So in natural units, γ = E/(m) = 8 / 1.2. Let me calculate that: 8 divided by 1.2 is approximately 6.6667. So, γ ≈ 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found using the relation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me solve for v. Rearranging, 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/γ² → v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

So, plugging in γ = 6.6667: 1/γ² is (1/6.6667)^2 ≈ (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So, 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So, v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 1/γ². 6.6667 squared is approximately (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444. So 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So yes, as before. So v is about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Alternatively, if I have to compute it precisely, perhaps I can use exact expressions. But maybe an approximation is sufficient for this problem.

Now, so the velocity v is about 0.9887 c. Let me note that c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

Next, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But wait, the width Γ is given in MeV. I need to make sure all units are consistent. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, wait. Let me check the units again.

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so Γ is 0.32 GeV. So, Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. Let's compute that.

ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, τ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV. The GeV units cancel, so τ ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me calculate that division:

6.582 / 0.32 = let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is about 20.56875 times 0.32.

Wait, 20 * 0.32 =6.4. 6.582-6.4=0.182. 0.182/0.32 = approx 0.56875. So total is 20.56875. So 6.582e-25 /0.32 = ~20.56875e-25 s? Wait no, wait 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 /0.32 ) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.
