Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options provided are four different distances in meters.

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is something like distance = velocity * lifetime. But wait, how do I get the lifetime from the given parameters?

Oh right, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm mixing up the units here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in natural units, but I need to convert that into meters and seconds.

Wait, let me think again. The decay width Γ is the total decay rate, and the lifetime τ is the mean lifetime. So yes, τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Also, the velocity comes into play. The mean decay length is L = v * τ. So I need to find the velocity of the meson X. How to get that?

The velocity can be found using the energy and mass. The meson is produced with energy E. The relation between energy, mass, and velocity is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is also equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to find v from E and m.

Let me compute the Lorentz factor γ first. E is given as 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. Since E = γ m c², then γ = E / (m c²). But since we're working in units where c is taken as 1 (like in particle physics), γ would just be E / m.

Wait, but when working in natural units (where c=1), energy, mass, and momentum are in the same units. So yes, γ = E / m. So E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, so γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, using γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), where β = v/c. Let me square both sides: γ² = 1/(1 - β²). Rearranging, 1 - β² = 1/γ² → β² = 1 - (1/γ²).

So β² = 1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) = 1 - (1/( (6.6667)^2 )).

Calculating 6.6667 squared: 6.6667^2 = 44.4444. So 1/44.4444 is approx 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c. That's a pretty high velocity, makes sense for a high-energy particle.

Now, to find the lifetime τ. As Γ is given, τ is ħ / Γ. But I need to convert units. Let me recall that ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, because ħ in units of GeV·s is about 6.582e-25. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let's compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Did I do that correctly? Because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.568e-25. Oh wait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 /0.32 ) * 1e-25. So yes, 6.582 /0.32 is indeed around 20.568, so 20.568e-25 s, which is 2.0568e-24 s.

Wait, no, wait: 1e-25 is ten to the minus 25, so when you divide 6.582e-25 by 0.32, it's (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25. So 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the velocity v is approximately 0.9887 c. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ. So L ≈ 2.966e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

Calculating that: 2.966e8 * 2.0568e-24 = (2.966 * 2.0568) * 1e-16.

Let me compute 2.966 * 2.0568. Hmm. Let's approximate.

2.966 * 2.0568 ≈ 2.966 * 2 =5.932, 2.966 * 0.0568 ≈ 0.1687. So total around 6.1007.

So L ≈ 6.1007e-16 m. Wait, but none of the options are around 6e-16. Wait, the options are A and D around 5e-16 or 4e-16. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me recalculate beta more accurately.

Earlier steps:

γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... So γ is 20/3, which is approximately 6.6666666667.

So β squared is 1 - (1/γ²) =1 - (1/( (20/3)^2 )) = 1 - (9/400) )= (400/400 - 9/400) = 391/400 = 0.9775.

Wait, 391/400 is 0.9775. So β = sqrt(0.9775) = ?

Let me compute that more accurately. sqrt(0.9775). Let me see, 0.9887^2 is about 0.9775, yes. So beta is approximately 0.9887 c.

Wait, maybe I should get a better approximation for beta. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more precisely.

Let me think: 0.9887^2 is 0.9775. So yes, beta is approximately 0.9887.

Alternatively, exact calculation:

0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087².

0.98² is 0.9604. 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 = 0.017292. 0.0087^2 is about 0.00007569. So total is 0.9604 + 0.017292=0.977692 + 0.00007569≈0.977767, which is a little higher than 0.9775, but that's okay. So beta is about 0.9887, but maybe a bit less. Let's see: 0.988^2 = (0.98 + 0.008)^2= 0.9604 + 0.0152 + 0.000064= 0.975664. Hmm, that's less than 0.9775. So which is it?

Wait, 0.988^2= 0.976144. Oh wait, no, 0.988 is 988/1000. Let me compute 988^2= (980+8)^2= 980² + 2*980*8 +8²= 960400 + 15680 +64 = 960400 + 15680= 976,080 +64=976,144. So 0.988^2= (988/1000)^2= 976144/1,000,000= 0.976144.

Wait, but we have 0.9775, which is higher. So 0.988^2= 0.976144, which is lower than 0.9775. So we need a higher value. Let's try 0.989^2= (989)^2= 989 *989. Let me compute that:

989 *989: 989^2 = (1000-11)^2 = 1000² - 2*10
