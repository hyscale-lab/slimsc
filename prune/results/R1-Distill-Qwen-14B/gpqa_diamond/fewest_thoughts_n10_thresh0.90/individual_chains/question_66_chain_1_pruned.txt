Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices combine these into different options.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible operators that can be constructed from the Standard Model fields, respecting certain symmetries. These operators are classified by their dimension, and the leading ones (dim-6) are often discussed.

So I'm trying to recall what symmetries the SMEFT respects. I think that the SMEFT is built respecting the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations, so if SMEFT respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? Or are they considered separately?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory based on it, it should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. That points to option 1 being correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. In effective theories, sometimes you don't have the same notion of translations because you're working in a specific energy scale, but SMEFT is constructed in a way that includes all possible operators, including those that respect the same symmetries as the SM. So I think operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. Wait, but does that mean that Poincare is a requirement? Or is it automatically included because Lorentz is?

Hmm. Maybe in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be Poincare-invariant. Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations, and if the operators are built from fields that transform under Lorentz and are translationally invariant, then Poincare is respected. But I'm not entirely sure if option 2 (Poincare) is a separate symmetry that must be respected or if it's automatically included because of Lorentz and other considerations. I'll have to think more.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries. I remember that the Standard Model is not symmetric under CP, but it does respect CPT. So, does SMEFT require operators to respect CP? Or can they violate it?

Wait, SMEFT allows for any possible operators, but the coefficients are determined by experiments. So the operators themselves must respect certain symmetries. For example, if the theory is CPT symmetric, then operators must be such that their CPT is respected. But wait, CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. I think that in effective theories like SMEFT, the symmetry is built in such a way that CPT is always respected because the underlying theory (Standard Model) respects CPT. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the Standard Model is CPT symmetric. So any effective theory derived from it should also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, operators in SMEFT must respect CPT. So option 4 (CPT) is a must.

What about CP symmetry? The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric, so SMEFT operators can violate CP. Therefore, the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 (CP) isn't something that must be respected.

So putting this together: which symmetries must be respected. So 1 (Lorentz) and 4 (CPT) are definitely required. What about Poincare (option 2)? Do the operators in SMEFT have to respect that?

Wait, I think that Poincare symmetry includes the possibility of momentum dependence, but in an effective theory, maybe we don't impose Poincare in the same way. Alternatively, I'm remembering that SMEFT is built in a way that it's a Lorentz-invariant theory, and that Poin
