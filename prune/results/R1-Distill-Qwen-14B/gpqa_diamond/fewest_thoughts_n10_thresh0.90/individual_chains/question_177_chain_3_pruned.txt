Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. So, M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So, if their lambda_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same too. Because if T increases, lambda_max decreases, and vice versa. So, T1 = T2.

They also found the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity... wait, but the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So maybe the radial velocity is a red herring, or perhaps it's used for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the radial velocity affects the observed temperature, but since the peak is the same, perhaps we can ignore the Doppler effect for this calculation? Or maybe the given velocities are actually the same, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming they're black bodies. So maybe the velocities are for something else, perhaps not directly affecting the luminosity calculation. Let me think.

The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. So I need to find L1 / L2.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4. Since both stars are black bodies, this should apply.

So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4
L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

But wait, from above, we know that T1 = T2. Because their peak emission wavelengths are the same. So T1 = T2 = T.

So the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1/R2)^2.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2) is 1.5. Squared is 2.25. So L1/L2 should be 2.25 times.

But wait, let me check. What about the Doppler shift due to radial velocity? Because Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s. So when a star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted. That would make the observed wavelength shorter. But the problem says the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So I think the Doppler effect must be considered when determining their actual temperatures. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, but the observed peak wavelength would be shorter. But the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So perhaps the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1, to compensate for the blueshift? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, let me think again. The peak wavelength (lambda_max) is inversely proportional to temperature. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would make the observed lambda_max smaller. But in reality, the actual lambda_max (emitted) for Star_2 would be higher if its temperature is lower. Because if Star_2's emitted lambda_max is larger, but blueshifted, the observed would be the same as Star_1's, which isn't moving.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me model it.

Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T.

But when a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter due to blueshift. So the observed lambda_max_obs = lambda_max_emit * sqrt( (c + v) / (c - v) )) ), but wait, no. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but when the source is moving towards us, v is positive. Wait, no, I think for the Doppler shift, when the source is moving towards us (v positive), wavelengths are blueshifted, so lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ). Wait, no. Let me make sure: the formula is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) when the source is moving away. Wait, no, that's for redshift. Let me think, when the source is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter. So the formula should be lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) ) 

Wait, let me recall the Doppler shift formula correctly. The relativistic Doppler shift factor for wavelength is given by:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ) )

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's get it right. The general Doppler shift formula for light when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, no, that's for when the source is moving away. Because if v is positive when moving away, the wavelength would be longer (redshifted). So if a source is moving towards us, v is negative. So let's better think in terms of radial velocity: positive v means moving away, negative means moving towards.

The formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + (v/c)) / (1 - (v/c)) ) )

But wait, when a source is moving towards the observer, v is negative, so the denominator becomes larger and the numerator smaller, leading to a smaller lambda_obs, which is correct for blueshift.

But in this problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

For Star_1, it's not moving, so v1 = 0. So lambda_obs_1 = lambda_emit_1.

For Star_2, v2 = 700 km/s (but wait, is it moving towards or away? The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700. Radial velocity is positive when moving away, I think. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.)

Wait, no, actually, radial velocity can be positive or negative depending on the convention. But in this context, Star_1's radial velocity is zero, so it's not moving towards or away. Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, which I think is positive, meaning moving away from us.

So let me write:

lambda_obs_1 = lambda_emit_1 (since v1=0)
lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emit_2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) )

But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So:

lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2

Which implies:

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But from Wien's law, lambda_emit is inversely proportional to temperature. So:

lambda_emit_1 = b / T1
lambda_emit_2 = b / T2

So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

The b's cancel out:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Take reciprocals on both sides:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Wait, but that would mean T1 is less than T2 if v2 is positive (since moving away). So, T1 < T2.

But earlier, I thought that T1 and T2 were the same because their observed peak wavelengths are the same. But that's not correct, because Star_2's light is redshifted, which would make its observed peak longer than it actually emits. But in the problem, the observed
