Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. So, the given information is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.
- Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2.
- The wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, that's interesting.
- The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.
- The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming black body radiation.

Wait, I should remember the formula for luminosity of a star as a black body. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is effective temperature. So L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth.

But wait, the problem says both stars have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. For a black body, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait a minute. If λ_max is the same, then T1 = T2. But that's under the assumption of black body radiation, which the problem states. So their temperatures are the same. So then, looking back at the luminosity formula, L is proportional to R² T⁴. If T is the same, L is proportional to R².

So, Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1 squared is (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2². So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. So the answer would be ~2.25, which is option A. But wait, that's the initial thought.

But wait, wait. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that fit in?

Hmm. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, so maybe because of the Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is the same for both?

Wait, let me think. If Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths would be Doppler shifted. But in the problem, the observed λ_max is the same. So for Star_1, since radial velocity is zero, the emitted λ_max is same as observed. For Star_2, its emitted λ_max would be shifted because of its velocity.

Wait, let me clarify. The observed brightness maximum (λ_max_obs) is the same for both stars. Let me denote the emitted λ_max
