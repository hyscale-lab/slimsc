Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to consider relativistic effects. But wait, let me think about what the problem is asking.

So the question is about finding the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving a relative speed and an energy.

First, relative speed. I think when objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because of relativity. Oh right! You can't just subtract their speeds in special relativity. Instead, the formula for adding velocities (since they're in the same direction, it's like adding one speed to the other but in the opposite direction for relative) comes into play.

Wait, no. The relative speed of one astronaut from the other's frame would be calculated using the velocity addition formula. Because in relativity, if you have two objects moving in the same direction, the speed of one as seen from the other isn't just the difference, it's more complicated.

The formula I remember for adding velocities is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, actually, let me get that right. The velocity of an object in one frame as observed from another frame moving at velocity u relative to the first is given by (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/(c²)), but that's when the frames are moving in the same direction. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the velocity of the second astronaut as seen from the first astronaut's frame. So the first astronaut is moving at v1 = 0.6c, and the second at v2=0.5c. Wait, but both are in the same direction. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Let me plug in the numbers. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would be negative because 0.5c is less than 0.6c. But since speed is positive, perhaps we take the absolute value. But the options have positive speeds, so the relative speed would be 0.1c/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²). Let's compute the denominator: 1 - (0.6*0.5) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So numerator: (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. Taking absolute value, it's 0.1c. But wait, the formula's denominator is (1 - (v1 v2)/(c^2)), and the numerator is (v2 -v1), so it's (v2 -v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait, but if v2 is smaller than v1, then the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(0.7) ) which is (-0.1c)/0.7 = -0.1428c. But wait, speed is positive, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. Oh! So the relative speed is about 0.14c. That would match option C or D.

Wait, but wait, I think I may have gotten the velocity addition formula wrong. Let me double-check. The formula for the relative velocity u' as observed from a frame moving at velocity v with respect to the original frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, the second astronaut's velocity in the first's frame is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/(c²)) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but since we are talking about speed, we take the magnitude, so 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc^2, and option D says same v_rel but E=5mc².

Now, the second part is the total energy. The total energy in relativity is the sum of their relativistic energies, but wait, no. Because the system's total energy isn't just the sum of their individual energies in their own frames, right? Because in the center-of-momentum frame, but wait, maybe the problem is considering the system as two separate objects moving in the same direction in the lab frame, so the total energy would be the sum of their energies in that frame.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the total energy of the system. So each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, and the total is the sum. But wait, the problem says 'the system', which I think refers to their energies as observed in their own rest frames, but no, probably in the same frame as the lab.

Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't specify the frame, but typically when you sum energies, you use the same reference frame. So perhaps each astronaut's energy is calculated in the lab frame, and then you sum them. Let's think: each has their own gamma factor, and energy is gamma * m c².

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v1^2/c^2)) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 mc².

So looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. So option C would be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the frame for the relative speed. Because when calculating the relative speed, the formula is (u' - v)/(1 - u' v/c²), where u' is the speed of the second object in the first's frame. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the other way around. Wait, no. The formula is for the speed of an object as observed from another frame moving at velocity v relative to the original frame. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at v2' = (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait: more accurately, if the first astronaut is moving at v1 in the lab frame, then the speed of the second astronaut in the first's frame is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). So (0.5c -0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative indicates direction (opposite to the original direction), but the speed is 0.1428c.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, which matches option C and D. Now, the energy part: total energy is about 5.96 mc², so only option C has that. Thus, the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but since we are interested in speed, the magnitude is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
