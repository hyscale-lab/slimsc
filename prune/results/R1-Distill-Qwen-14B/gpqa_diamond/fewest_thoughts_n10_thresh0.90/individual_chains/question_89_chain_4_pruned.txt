Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still pretty new to this. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what each step does.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on the same face perhaps. Heating with KOH in a dehydrohalogenation reaction. KOH is a strong base, so elimination (E2) is likely. Since there are two Br atoms, maybe it's a double elimination.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH would probably remove two HBr molecules, leading to the formation of an alkene. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the elimination would probably form a bridge or a double bond in a specific position.

Wait, in adamantane, each carbon is bonded to three others in a diamond structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on opposite positions of the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, each Br leaves, and an E2 mechanism forms a double bond. But since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations happen, forming a diene? Or maybe a conjugated diene.

Wait, elimination from each Br would form a double bond between each adjacent carbon, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it forms a single double bond as both Br are on adjacent carbons? Wait, 1 and 3 positions in adamantane... Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to an exo double bond.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, so elimination would form a bridge with a double bond. Or perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound with a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the product's NMR. Product 1 has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, would more likely form an epoxide? Or not. Wait, no, epoxide formation is more with peracids. Alternatively, elimination would form an alkene. But the IR at 1720 might suggest a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. KOH is a base but can also be a nucleophile. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. If it's treated with KOH, perhaps it's a double substitution? But that would form a diketone? Because each Br is replaced by OH, but then maybe dehydration occurs, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination (dehydrohalogenation) to form an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which might not fit. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would require a substitution. But with KOH, the reaction might be elimination, not substitution. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR of product 1. The peaks are: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's think about this.

The peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group next to an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests a lot of equivalent CH2 groups, perhaps in a diamondoid structure. The 1.94 (2H) might be another methylene group, maybe near a carbonyl.

Wait, if the product is a ketone, then the 4.79 (2H) might be a CH2 next to a carbonyl (like in a ketone, those Hs are typically around 2-3 ppm, but maybe if it's an enol, it could be higher). Alternatively, it could be an epoxide's CH2. No, the IR is 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, so perhaps a ketone.

Wait, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But then, what would product 1 be? Maybe if two HBr are eliminated, forming a double bond. But then, why would the IR have a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by OH, but then maybe dehydration occurs to form a carbonyl. So, maybe two OH groups are formed, which lose water to form a ketone. Wait, but in that case, you would need two OH groups adjacent or something that can form a carbonyl.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on opposite bridgeheads. If each Br is replaced by OH, the structure would have two OHs on opposite bridgeheads. But then, how would they lose water to form a carbonyl? Maybe the two OHs are on adjacent carbons, but in adamantane, 1 and 3 positions might be opposite each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more of a ring-opening. Wait, maybe the initial structure is a bicyclic dihalide. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should think about the other steps.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al(OiPr)3 (aluminum isopropoxide). Al-based reagents are often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but since product 1 is a ketone (from the IR), perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or something else. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid catalyst for some reaction.

Wait, product 1's NMR: 4.79 (2H) could be an oxygen-bearing CH2, maybe an ether or a carbonyl. The 10H in 2.4-2.23 ppm suggests a lot of equivalent CH2 groups, which is common in adamantane derivatives.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1,3-diketone? But I'm not sure.

Wait, so product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane? Then product 2 is made by heating with Al isopropoxide. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would require an aromatic ring, which I don't think adamantane has.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but the IR doesn't fit. Wait, no, the IR at 1720 is more likely a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization or elimination. Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but I'm not seeing where the aromatic ring would be.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't show OH stretch, but maybe it's dehydrated in the next step.

Wait, maybe I should move to the next step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were in product 2.

So, the NMR of product 3 is being asked about the coupling of the most deshielded H. The most deshielded would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

But wait, if product 3 is after ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds, the structure would have carbonyl groups. The original product 2 would have had a double bond.

So, let me backtrack. Product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH. Let's think about elimination. Eliminating two HBr would form a diene perhaps, but more likely a bridge with a double bond. Alternatively, since the product has a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a bridgehead double bond. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a dialkene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 (2H) could be an OCH2 group. Wait, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl group with adjacent CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But the IR at 1720 doesn't fit with an epoxide's C-O-C. Epoxides have around 1250 cm-1 for C-O.

Wait, the IR at 1720 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl, like a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

But how? Starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Maybe the initial reaction is a substitution where OH groups are introduced, and then dehydration forms a ketone.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with excess KOH, perhaps it undergoes two SN2 substitutions, replacing each Br with OH, giving 1,3-diol adamantane. Then, perhaps heating this diol leads to dehydration, forming a ketone. But how would two -OH groups on adjacent carbons dehydrate to form a ketone? That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond, but then dehydration to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the initial product is an epoxide, but I'm not seeing it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH induces a ring-opening of the adamantane structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 (2H), which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is a lot of equivalent CH2 groups, which makes me think of a structure with multiple CH2 groups, like in adamantane.

The 1.94 (2H) might be a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane? Let's imagine that.

So, product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane.

Then, product 2 is made by heating with Al(OiPr)3. Al-based reagents are often used in Friedel-Crafts, but maybe in this case, it's a different reaction. Alternatively, Al(OiPr)3 can act as a Lewis acid catalyst for some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but 1,3-diketone would have two ketone groups. Maybe when heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid, it could activate the ketone for some kind of ring formation or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is part of a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but I'm not sure where the aromatic ring is in adamantane. Adamantane is more of a diamondoid structure, so maybe not.

Wait, maybe the Al isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for aldol condensation. In a diketone, perhaps the two carbonyl groups could undergo aldol condensation, forming a ring with a double bond.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the Al(OiPr)3 is facilitating a Claisen condensation, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with some substituents, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps product 2 has a double bond, which is then cleaved in product 3.

So, product 1 is perhaps a dienone or something with a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone with a double bond next to one of the ketones. Then, product 2 might have a conjugated diene or something else.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone, and then in the next step, an elimination occurs to form a double bond.

Wait, product 1: 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, product 2 is made by heating with Al isopropoxide. Maybe this induces an elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to a ketone.

So, product 2 might have a conjugated diene or a double bond near a ketone group.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have more carbonyl groups than product 2.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded H would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a CH group next to a carbonyl.

Wait, in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each end becomes a carbonyl group. So, if the double bond was between C1 and C2, then each would have a carbonyl.

But the exact structure is tricky. Alternatively, maybe product 3 has a carbonyl group and some CH2 or CH groups adjacent to it, which would give specific coupling patterns.

Wait, product 3 is after ozonolysis followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis with dimethylsulfide typically leads to cleavage without further oxidation. So, each double bond is split into two carbonyls.

So, assuming product 2 has a double bond, perhaps in a bridge structure, product 3 would have two new carbonyl groups.

Now, looking at the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H is next to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. The coupling would depend on the neighboring H.

Wait, but the question says to exclude H that exchange with deuterated solvent. So, maybe it's in a diol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the H in question is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is coupled with two other equivalent Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structures.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → heated with KOH → product 1 (light yellow, IR 1720 → carbonyl).

   So, perhaps product 1 is a diol that dehydrates to form a ketone, but that would require two OH groups. Or perhaps it's a single substitution leading to a bromide and then elimination to form a double bond, but that would require only one Br eliminated.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a bridgehead double bond. So, product 1 would be a bridgehead double bond in adamantane, which would be a bicyclic structure.

But then, the IR at 1720 would imply a carbonyl, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Another angle: The NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a high shift, so maybe it's an OCH2 group. But if the product is a diol, the OCH2 would show up around 3-4 ppm, but here it's 4.79.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. In a carbonyl adjacent CH2, the Hs are typically around 2-3 ppm, but maybe in some cases, they can be higher.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diketone. Then, the 4.79 (2H) might not fit. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl group elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by a ketone. But that doesn't make sense because substitution replaces Br with a group like OH or O-.

Wait, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides. Not applicable here.

Hmm, I'm stuck on product 1. Let's think about product 2.

Product 2 is made by heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. So, perhaps product 1 is reacting in a Friedel-Crafts-like reaction, but without an aromatic ring, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and Al(OiPr)3 is facilitating some acylation or alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, product 1's IR is 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So, product 1 is a ketone.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 is a ketone. How?

Perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, which upon workup gives a ketone. Wait, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br
