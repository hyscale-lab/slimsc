Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. They've given me the IR and NMR data. Let me look at the IR data first. The peaks are in the regions of 3400–2500, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1.

IR analysis:
- The 3400–2500 cm-1 range usually suggests O-H or N-H stretches. The broadness might indicate an O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 peak is more likely a carbonyl group, probably from a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 as broad peaks. So if the IR has a peak in 3400–2500, that might suggest an -OH group. So maybe a carboxylic acid?
- The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700. So maybe that's a good fit.
- The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are probably aromatic C=C stretches. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very high chemical shift. Typically, this could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid -OH proton, but those are usually broad and can appear around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, an aromatic -COOH group's acidic proton. So maybe that's the -OH of a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted since it's a doublet. So if the aromatic ring is para-substituted, like in a benzoic acid.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, also doublet. So this would fit with a para-substituted benzene ring, where each pair is equivalent. For example, in a para-substituted benzoic acid, the protons adjacent to the substituent would split into two doublets.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet. Maybe a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a larger structure. Hmm, perhaps a CH next to an oxygen or in a branched chain.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet, maybe a CH2 group attached to something else. Like maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl group or part of a substituent.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three hydrogens, perhaps as a methyl group attached to something that's branching. Like a CH(CH3) group? Or maybe a geminal di-substitution.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal methyl group, maybe part of an ethyl chain. Like CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the aromatic part is a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituents are likely a carboxylic acid group and another group. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the 10.5 ppm is the -OH of the carboxylic acid, so the substituent is a COOH group on the benzene ring. Then, the other substituent would be another group on the ring.

Looking at the NMR, the other protons are:
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH in between, like a CH next to a carbonyl or another group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a CH2 that's next to a branching point.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): So a methyl group attached to a CH. For example, maybe a structure like CH(CH3)2, but wait, the integral is 3H, so it's a methyl group attached to a CH. Like, maybe it's a CH(CH3) group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): An ethyl group, maybe like CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a chain attached to the ring. Let me think. Let's imagine that the benzene ring has a COOH group and another substituent, say, a propyl group or something more complex.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents? Or wait, maybe it's a meta substituent? No, because the doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons. So, for example, if the substituents are at para positions, but that would require two substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent that's causing the splitting.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents, perhaps one is COOH and the other is an alkyl group. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl at 1720. If the substituent is a COOH, that would fit. So the benzene ring has a COOH group and another group in the para position.

Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but the doublets suggest that the aromatic protons are split into two sets of two each, which would fit a para substitution.

Wait, let me try to sketch this. Let's suppose the benzene ring has a COOH group attached at position 1, and another substituent at position 4 (para). That substituent would have a structure that leads to the NMR signals we're seeing.

So, the substituent at position 4 could be a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something more complex. Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is likely a CH2CH3 group. So maybe the substituent is a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group or a butyl group. Let's think:

The NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is the end of an ethyl chain. So perhaps it's a CH2CH2CH3 group, but that may not fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) something.

Wait, the NMR signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm could suggest a branching. Let me try to piece this together.

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet integrating to 1H. That could be a CH attached to something else. Then 1.7 ppm is a multiplet integrating to 2H; perhaps a CH2 group. 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which would be a methyl group attached to a CH. So it's like CH(CH3) with adjacent groups. Then the 0.9 ppm triplet is a CH2CH3 group attached further away.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, no. Or maybe it's a branching where the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but with a branch. Let me think. The 2.9 ppm could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached via a CH.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Because the 1.4 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is then attached to another CH2.

Let me try to construct this. The substituent would be something like CH2-CH(CH3)-something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a isobutyl group. Let's see. An isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. But in that case, the NMR would show certain signals. Hmm.

Alternatively, considering the substituent as a CH2CH2 chain with branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, the 0.9 triplet is likely a CH2CH3 group, so that's the end of an ethyl chain. Then the 1.7 multiplet (2H) would be a CH2 adjacent to that, perhaps. Then the 1.4 doublet (3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH. So the structure might be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3?

Wait, no, that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching like (CH2)2CHCH2CH3. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group connected to a CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that would have a different NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR. The substituent's NMR would show the protons on the substituent. So, for an isobutyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2.

So, the isobutyl group would have a CH2 group attached to the benzene ring, then a CH(CH3)2.

But let's see the signals. The CH2 would be adjacent to the ring. The isobutyl group's structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)
