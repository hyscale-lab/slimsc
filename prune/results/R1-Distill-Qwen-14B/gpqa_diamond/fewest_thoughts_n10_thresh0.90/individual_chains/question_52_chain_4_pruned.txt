Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out what's being asked.

Alright, the question is about a star's properties when it has spots versus when it doesn't. The star normally has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the main point is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes—so, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. And they mention that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think is important for applying certain laws or equations.

Hmm. So, I remember from my studies that the ratio of populations in different energy levels in atoms is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and E is energy. 

But wait, in this problem, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower, which would affect the ratio. Let me think: if the temperature decreases, how does that affect the ratio n2/n1?

Well, the energy difference between the two levels (E2 - E1) is related to the wavelength. Using the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So, for 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 meters.

But wait, maybe I don't need to calculate E directly. Because in the Boltzmann factor, it's the ratio (E2-E1)/(k*T) that's important. So if the temperature changes, the exponent changes.

Let's outline the variables:

- When no spots: T1 = 6000 K
- When spots: T2 = 5500 K
- Ratio without spots (R1) = n2/n1 at T1
- Ratio with spots (R2) = n2/n1 at T2
- The factor we're looking for is R1 / R2

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R1 is higher than R2. So R1/R2 is greater than 1, which means the factor is something like R1/R2 = (R1)/(R2) = (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2.

But wait, the ratio n2/n1 depends on the temperature. Let's think about how. Let's say that when temperature increases, the ratio n2/n1 increases if the energy level transition is
