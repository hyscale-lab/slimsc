Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, but I'm not going to peek at those yet; I'll try to solve it first.

Hmm, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first astronaut's frame should be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c² / c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. That looks like either option C or D, since their v_rel is 0.14c.

Now, for the total energy. I remember that the total energy in relativity is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, no, actually, each object's total energy is gamma times m c squared. So for each astronaut, calculate their gamma factor, multiply by their rest mass energy, then sum them.

Wait, but wait, the gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute each gamma.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c.
Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Mass is 2m, so energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c.
Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Mass is 3m, so E2 = gamma2 *3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc².

So putting it together, the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I calculate the relative speed correctly? Let me check the formula again. The relative velocity u is (v1 - v2)/(1 - v1 v2/(c^2)). So plugging in v1=0.6c, v2=0.5c:

u = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c /0.7 ≈0.14286c. So 0.14c when rounded, which matches option C and D.

So for the energy, yeah, I think I did that right. So option C gives both 0.14c and 5.96 mc², which matches my calculations.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14286c
\]

Rounded to two decimal places, the relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(v = 0.6c, m = 2m\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(v = 0.5c, m = 3m\
