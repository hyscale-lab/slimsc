Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy required to make a certain nucleus move at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations. 

The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li typically has 3 protons and varies in neutrons. So Li-6 has 3 neutrons, right? Because Li-6 is like the stable isotope. So the mass number A would be 6 (3 protons +3 neutrons). So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

First, I think I need to find the rest mass of the nucleus. But wait, I don't remember the exact rest mass for Li-6. Maybe I can compute it. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and neutrons are a bit less but close. Wait, no, the exact masses might be needed. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the atomic mass unit or some approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the approximate rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the molar mass in some way. Wait, no, that might not be precise enough. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to know that the rest mass energy of the nucleus is given by the sum of the masses of its constituents. But wait, protons and neutrons are nucleons, each about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 * 938 ≈ 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, that's the sum of their rest masses, but in reality, the nucleus has a binding energy, so the actual rest mass would be less. Hmm, but maybe for this problem, the rest mass is given or we can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the necessary data elsewhere, but in this case, I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014 atomic mass units (u). Because I remember that each u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so the rest mass energy would be 6.014 * 931.5 MeV. Let me calculate that.

6.014 * 931.5 ≈ Let's see, 6 *931.5 = 5589, 0.014*931.5 is about 13.04. So total is about 5602.04 MeV, which is 5.602 GeV. But wait, that might be the rest energy of the nucleus. Hmm, but wait, if the nucleus is moving, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

The question is about the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. So I think I need to calculate the total energy using the relativistic energy equation: E = gamma * m0 c². So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Wait, v is 0.96c. So let's compute beta (β) as v/c = 0.96. Then, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/0.28 is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma * m0 c². So m0 is the rest mass. Earlier, I thought m0 c² is about 5.602 GeV. So E would be 3.5714 * 5.602 GeV. Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.602 = Let me do this step by step.

3 * 5.602 = 16.806

0.5714 *5.602 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *5.602 = 2.801, 0.0714 *5.602 ≈0.401.

So 2.801 + 0.401 = 3.202.

So total is 16.806 +3.202 = 20.008 GeV. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV. So my calculation is about 20.008 GeV, which is close to 20 GeV. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait another thing, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let's re-calculate the rest mass energy.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014 u. Each u is exactly 931.494064 MeV/c². So 6.014 * 931.494064 = let's compute that.

6 * 931.494064 = 5588.964384 MeV.

0.014 *931.494064 = approximately 13.040917 MeV.

So 5588.964384 +13.040917 = 5602.0053 MeV, which is 5.6020053 GeV.

So m0 c² is 5.6020053 GeV.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.6020053 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6020053 = 

Let me do it as 3.57142857 = 25/7 approximately. So 25/7 *5.6020053 = (25 *5.6020053)/7.

25 *5.6020053 = 140.0501325.

Divide by 7: 140.0501325 /7 ≈ 20.0071618 GeV.

So about 20.007 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps my initial approach is missing something.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass. Because sometimes, the actual rest mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its nucleons. Because the binding energy is subtracted. Wait, for example, the mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy (mass defect). So perhaps the rest mass I calculated is overestimated.

Wait, but in my calculation, I used the atomic mass of Li-6, which takes into account the binding energy. So the atomic mass is the actual mass of the nucleus plus the binding energy. Wait, no, the atomic mass includes electrons as well. Wait, no, Li-6 as a nucleus would have a mass of about 6 u minus the electrons. Wait, no, the atomic mass of Li-6 is the mass of the atom, which includes electrons. So to get the nucleus mass, I need to subtract the electrons.

Wait, Li has atomic number 3, so each Li atom has 3 electrons. So the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014 u, as I thought. So the nuclear mass is 6.014 u minus the mass of 3 electrons. The mass of an electron is about 0.
