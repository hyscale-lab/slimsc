Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how the flux changes when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but I'll try to think through it.

So, the question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The scenario is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. And we're to find the ratio flux1/flux2.

First, I remember that the Sun's core produces neutrinos through various processes. The main ones are the proton-proton chains. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh wait, the question specifies that only the pp-III branch stops. So the other reactions continue as usual.

Wait, what do these pp branches produce? I think the pp-I chain is the dominant one, producing a lot of neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III are less significant. So if pp-III stops, what changes?

Neutrinos are produced in different energy ranges based on the reactions. The pp-I branch mainly produces lower-energy neutrinos, while pp-II and pp-III produce higher ones. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Let me think. The pp-I chain involves two protons fusing to deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. The neutrino energy from pp-I is around 0.4 MeV, so about 400 keV. The pp-II and pp-III processes produce higher-energy neutrinos. 

So if pp-III stops, then the higher-energy neutrinos from that process would stop being emitted. But the question is about the flux in specific energy bands.

The flux is the number of neutrinos per cmÂ² per second. So if pp-III was a significant source for higher energies, stopping it would reduce the flux in those higher bands.

Wait, let's get the energy ranges. The bands are 700-800 (band1) and 800-900 (band2). So band1 is 100 keV lower than band2.

If pp-III produces neutrinos in band2 (800-900 keV), then stopping it would reduce the flux in band2. But what about band1 (700-800)? Are those mainly from pp-I and other branches?

So prior to the stoppage, the flux in band2 was coming from pp-III. If pp-III stops, then the only contribution to band2 is from other processes. Wait, but I thought pp-III was a minor contributor. So if it stops, the flux in band2 would drop, but band1 would remain roughly the same.

Wait, but the dominant neutrino production is from pp-I. So, the lower energy neutrinos (like band1) are mainly from pp-I, while higher energy (like band2) are from other branches.

So if pp-III stops, the higher-energy neutrinos (band2) would be affected more. So the flux in band1 (700-800) remains mostly the same, but band2 (800-900) would drop significantly.

But wait, what about the other pp branches? If only pp-III stops, then pp-I and pp-II continue. Do pp-II and pp-I produce neutrinos in band2?

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. Let me recall: The main neutrino production is from the pp-I chain, which emits neutrinos around 0.4 MeV, so that's below 700 keV. The other branches (pp-II and pp-III) produce higher-energy neutrinos. So band1 (700-800) would have some contribution from pp-II and pp-III, but perhaps mostly from pp-I. Wait, no, because pp-I produces lower energy. So maybe band1 is in the range of pp-II and pp-III.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos. The pp-I chain produces neutrinos with an average energy of about 0.4 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III branches emit neutrinos with higher energies, maybe around 1-2 MeV or something like that. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 100s of keV up to maybe a few MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the energies from the different branches are as follows: pp-I produces lower energies, say up to 1 MeV, while pp-II and pp-III produce higher. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. If the pp-III branch stops, what's the impact on the number of neutrinos emitted in higher energy ranges? Since pp-III is stopped, neutrinos from that branch in the 800-900 keV band would no longer be produced. So the flux in band2 would decrease if the pp-III was a major contributor there.

But how do the fluxes compare between band1 and band2 under normal circumstances? If pp-III was a significant source for band2, and the other sources (like pp-I and pp-II) contribute more to band1, then the ratio of flux1/flux2 would change.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band2 is a smaller fraction of the total than band1, so stopping pp-III would make band2 flux drop, while band1 remains similar.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux1 to flux2 after the pp-III stops. So previously, the flux in band2 was higher because of pp-III. Now, if pp-III stops, band2's flux would drop, while band1's flux remains the same (assuming band1's neutrinos come from other processes that aren't affected).

Wait, no. Let's think: pp-III contributes neutrinos to band2. So when it stops, the flux in band2 decreases. Suppose before the stoppage, the flux in band2 was higher than band1, but now it's lower.

Wait, perhaps neutrinos from pp-III are the main contributors to band2. So if they stop, the flux in band2 would drop. But what about the flux in band1? If band1 was already mostly from other sources (like pp-I and pp-II), then the flux in band1 doesn't change much.

So, the initial scenario: pp-III is producing neutrinos in band2. So without pp-III, band2's flux is lower.

But the question is the ratio of flux1 (700-800) to flux2 (800-900) after the stoppage.

Wait, perhaps the flux in band2 is entirely from pp-III. So when it stops, flux2 becomes zero. But that's probably not the case. Because the other branches (pp-I and pp-II) might contribute some neutrinos in band2. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II branch contributes to band1 and not band2.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to the others. So the total flux in band2 is mainly from pp-III. If pp-III stops, the flux in band2 drops, but flux in band1 is the same.

But without knowing the exact energy distributions, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the main source for the higher energy neutrinos, which would be in band2. So when pp-III stops, the flux in band2 would decrease significantly, while band1 remains as before.

So, the ratio flux1/flux2 would increase because flux2 is now lower. But by how much?

I think I need to consider the typical flux contributions. Normally, the solar neutrino flux peaks at lower energies. The higher energy bands have lower flux. But if pp-III is a significant contributor to high-energy neutrinos, its stoppage would reduce the high-energy flux.

So, initially, the flux in band2 would be lower than band1 perhaps? Or higher? I'm not certain.

Wait, the solar neutrino flux is highest at lower energies, around 0.3-0.5 MeV, as that's where the dominant pp-I process emits. So band1 (700-800 keV, which is 0.7-0.8 MeV) is in the region where the flux is still relatively high. Band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is just a bit higher, but not too much.

But wait, even at 0.8 MeV, the flux is probably still higher than higher energies. So, if under normal conditions, flux2 is lower than flux1 because higher energy has less flux, then the ratio flux1/flux2 would be greater than 1.

But if pp-III is a significant contributor to flux2, and all other processes contribute about the same to both bands, then when pp-III stops, the flux2 would drop, making the ratio higher.

Wait, but I'm not sure how much each branch contributes. Let me think: the pp-I branch is the main contributor, producing about 90% of all neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III contribute a smaller fraction.

So, if pp-III produces a certain number of high-energy neutrinos, and pp-I produces low energy, and pp-II produces medium energy, then the energy bands can be thought of as:

- Band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV): mainly from pp-I and perhaps some from pp-II.

- Band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV): mainly from pp-II and pp-III.

Wait, but that's just a guess. So, if pp-III is stopped, then the contribution to band2 from pp-III is gone. So the flux in band2 would be the sum of contributions from pp-I and pp-II. But wait, pp-II's neutrinos are in lower energies, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos from pp-II have energies around 1-2 MeV, so higher than band2. So if pp-III's neutrinos are in 0.8-0.9 MeV, then stopping pp-III would remove a significant part of band2's flux.

But without knowing the exact energy spectra, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps all the pp-III neutrinos are in band2, so stopping it would eliminate that flux.

Wait, another angle. The question is about the ratio before and after. But what's the ratio of flux in band1 to band2 under normal conditions? If pp-III is a major source for band2, then the ratio would be lower than 1. Because band2's flux is higher. But if pp-III stops, band2's flux drops, so the ratio may go up.

Wait, no, the ratio is flux1 / flux2. So, if after the stoppage, flux2 is lower, then the ratio would be larger than before.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let's think of it in terms of possible orders of magnitude.

If pp-III contributes significantly to band2, then without it, flux2 would be much lower. Suppose prior to stopping, flux2 was, say, 10 times flux1. Then the ratio flux1/flux2 would be 0.1. But after stopping, if flux2 drops by a factor of 10 (assuming pp-III was the only contributor), flux2 becomes (flux2_initial - pp_III_flux) = let's say (10 units - 9 units) = 1 unit. Then flux1 is still 1 unit, so the ratio becomes 1. So, the ratio would jump from 0.1 to 1.

But I'm not sure about the initial ratio. Alternatively, if pp-III contributes a small fraction to band2, then the impact is less.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main high-energy ones. So, the flux in band2 would be dominated by pp-III. So, if pp-III stops, flux2 would drop by a large fraction.

But without knowing the exact numbers, I'm going to have to make an educated guess.

In the options, the possible ratios are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

If the ratio flux1/flux2 was roughly 0.1 before, and after pp-III stops, it goes up to 1, then the answer would be 1.

Alternatively, if the initial ratio was 1, and after pp-III stops, the flux2 drops by a factor of 10, making the ratio 10. But I think that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: pp-III produces neutrinos in the range of about 1-2 MeV, perhaps. So, band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) and band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) would have much smaller contributions from pp-III. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another way to think: the pp-III branch produces a small number of neutrinos, but at higher energies. So, the flux in band2 (0.8-0.9) would have a significant contribution from pp-III. So, when pp-III stops, flux2 would drop, but flux1 (which is lower energy) remains the same.

So, if prior to stopping, flux2 was a certain value, and after stopping, it's reduced by a factor of 10, for instance, then the ratio flux1/flux2 would increase by a factor of 10.

But I'm not certain about the exact numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are a minor part of the total, so the drop in band2 is small.

Wait, maybe the pp-III branch contributes about 1% of the total neutrino flux. So, stopping it would reduce band2's flux by 1%, which wouldn't change the ratio much. But I think the question implies that the pp-III is a significant contributor to the high-energy neutrinos.

Alternatively, considering that the pp-III branch is responsible for about 0.57% of the solar neutrino flux, as I vaguely recall, but that's a very small contribution.

Wait, but even
