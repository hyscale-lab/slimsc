Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are as usual. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with ratios like 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

Wait, first, I remember that the pp chain is a major source of solar energy, producing a lot of high-energy particles, including neutrinos. The pp-III branch must be a specific part of this chain. So, if pp-III stops, the production of certain neutrinos would stop. 

But I'm a bit confused about what pp-III specifically produces. From what I recall, the proton-proton chain has different branches. The main pp-I branch produces a helium-4 nucleus, and in the process, emits two positrons and two neutrinos. The pp-II branch might involve boron-8, which then decays into beryllium-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the details here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the neutrino energies. The neutrinos from the pp chain have lower energies compared to those from the CNO cycle. Because the pp chain produces things like 3He, which then combines further. The neutrinos from the pp chain are usually around a few MeV. For instance, the Beryllium-7 neutrinos (from the pp-I branch) are about 0.3-0.6 MeV, I think. But the question is about higher energies, like 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. That's 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. If pp-III stops, what's the impact on the neutrino flux? Let me think. The pp-III branch must produce neutrinos in a certain energy range. If it stops, the flux in that energy range would drop, but other sources might still contribute.

Wait, the Sun's main neutrino production is from the proton-proton chain, which has several branches. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, producing about 86% of the Sun's energy. The pp-II and pp-III branches are less significant, but each contributes a smaller portion. So if pp-III stops, the production of neutrinos from that branch would cease.

But I'm trying to find the ratio of two specific neutrino bands. So I need to know which neutrinos are emitted in those energy ranges, and how they're affected by the stopping of pp-III.

Wait, I've read that the neutrinos from the pp chain are in the ~0.2-0.6 MeV range. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, around 1-4 MeV. But the CNO contribution is about 14% in the Sun, so the majority of neutrinos are from the pp chain. So if pp-III stops, which neutrinos are affected?

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces a specific kind of neutrino, like in a specific energy band. For example, the neutrinos from the decay of Beryllium-8 in the pp-II branch are around 0.5 MeV. Wait, but the question is about 0.7-0.9 MeV. That's higher than typical pp neutrinos. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the neutrino energies. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos via a specific decay process that emits higher-energy neutrinos. Or perhaps stopping the pp-III branch affects the production of a particular isotope, which impacts the neutrino spectrum.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the neutrino energy spectrum in the Sun. The majority of solar neutrinos are from the pp chain, specifically from the reactions involving Beryllium-7 and Boron-8. So, for example, the Beryllium-7 neutrinos come from Be-7 capturing a proton to become Boron-8, which then decays into Be-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. The neutrino energy from this process is about 0.3-0.6 MeV, I think.

Oh wait, but the question is about higher energies, 0.7-0.9 MeV. Could that be from a different process? Or perhaps the solar model is such that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in a specific higher energy range. Maybe that's where I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is part of the chain that produces higher-energy neutrinos. If pp-III stops, the production of these higher-energy neutrinos would drop.

Wait, but the initial assumption is that all other reactions are unchanged. So only the pp-III branch is stopped. So, if pp-III is a minor contributor to the neutrino flux, then stopping it would reduce the flux in a particular energy band, but not all.

But I'm trying to find the ratio between two bands. So, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV). If pp-III is stopped, perhaps the flux in both bands is affected, but in different ways.

Wait, maybe the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in a higher energy range. So, if that's the case, then the flux in higher energy bands would decrease more. So, the flux in band 2 would be lower than band 1. Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite. Let's think: if pp-III stopped, which part of the neutrino spectrum would be affected? Let me imagine the Sun's neutrino spectrum. The dominant neutrinos are from Be-7 (pp-I branch) in the 0.3-0.6 MeV range. The pp-II branch produces some higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps up to around 0.8 MeV. Then the pp-III branch might produce even higher, maybe around 0.7-0.9 MeV?

Wait, no. Wait, maybe the pp-III branch is part of a reaction that produces higher-energy neutrinos. For example, if the pp-III branch produces a proton and a neutron via a certain reaction, and then the neutron decays, emitting a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino would depend on the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is part of a process that emits neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. So, if pp-III stops, the flux in that higher energy band (band 2) would drop, but the lower band (band 1, 0.7-0.8 MeV) might be less affected because other branches (like pp-II) might still contribute to that band.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the neutrino flux, then the ratio of the fluxes between band 1 and band 2 would change. Let me think: before the pp-III stopped, the flux in band 2 (higher energy) might have been higher than band 1. But
