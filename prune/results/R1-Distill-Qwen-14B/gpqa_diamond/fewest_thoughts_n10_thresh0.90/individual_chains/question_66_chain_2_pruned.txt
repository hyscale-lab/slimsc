Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT, and the symmetries that its operators must respect. Hmm, I remember SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators consistent with some underlying symmetry, like the Standard Model symmetries but maybe extended.

The question is asking which of the four symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare includes Lorentz, translations, and boosts. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But if the question is about what's required, maybe SMEFT requires operators to respect both? Or perhaps one includes the other.

I think SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars, which means they must transform in a way that doesn't change the theory under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely required.

Poincare symmetry includes translations as well. But wait, if the theory includes translations, it must have a well-defined energy-momentum, etc. But SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Do effective theories necessarily respect Poincare symmetry? I think they do. Because effective theories are still local and Lorentz-invariant, so they must respect Poincare, which includes translations. So option 2, Poincare, would also be a symmetry that operators must respect? Or wait, does SMEFT allow operators that don't respect translations? No, because SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, which implies Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, it's not included. So options 1 and 2 are both required.

Then options 3 and 4. CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity. But SMEFT doesn't necessarily require operators to respect CP. Some operators might violate CP. For example, certain higher-dimension operators could be CP-odd. So not all operators must respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not necessarily required.

CPT symmetry, though, is a bigger symmetry. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Because Lorentz symmetry enforces some aspects of CPT. So if SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, then operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 must be respected.

So putting it together: which of the four must all operators respect? 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT).

Wait, but wait. Does SMEFT necessarily respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations, which require the theory to have a well-defined energy-momentum. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, it must respect Poincare. So operators in SMEFT must be Poincare symmetric.

Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory, so it's written with a cutoff scale. Does that affect Poincare symmetry? I don't think so. The effective theory is still
