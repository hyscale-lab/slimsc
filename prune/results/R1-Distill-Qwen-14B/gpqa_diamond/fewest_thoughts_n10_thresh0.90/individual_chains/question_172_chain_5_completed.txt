Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation is higher in star_1. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are, right? Because thermal energy provides the energy to jump to higher energy levels.

So both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means we can use the Boltzmann equation for the excitation levels. The Boltzmann distribution tells us the relative populations of different energy levels in a gas. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, let's say the two energy levels are i and j. But the problem states that for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, but the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote that as delta_E = E_i - E_j, assuming i is higher than j.

So for star_1, the ratio n_i / n_j is 2. For star_2, it's 1, because the excitation is lower. Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2". So perhaps n_i (excited state) over n_j (ground state) is 2 for star_1, and 1 for star_2? Or maybe n_i for star_1 is twice that of star_2's n_i? Wait, no, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me re-read.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, perhaps n_i for star_1 is twice n_i for star_2. So the number of excited atoms is higher in star_1. But wait, the energy difference is the same for both because it's the same transition in iron, so delta E is the same.

So for star 1: (n_i / n_j) = 2, for star 2: (n_i' / n_j') = 1, I think. Because star_1 has twice as many atoms in the higher energy level as compared to star_2.

Wait, but actually, the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) for star 1 is twice as much as that for star 2. So if star_2's ratio is x, star_1's is 2x.

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation level is higher, so the ratio is higher. So the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

No, wait, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2, it's 1. Because the problem says "twice as excited", which implies that in star_1, the number of excited atoms is double that of star_2.

Wait, maybe not. Maybe the exact wording is that the excitation is twice as much, so for star_1, the ratio n_i/n_j is 2, and for star_2, it's (n_i/n_j) = 1.

Wait, but that would mean star_1's ratio is 2, star_2's is 1. So in that case, for each star, we can write the Boltzmann equation for their respective temperatures.

So for star_1: (n_i1)/(n_j1) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - delta_E/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2: (n_i2)/(n_j2) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - delta_E/(k T2) )

But wait, the problem says that star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So perhaps (n_i1) = 2 * (n_i2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So star_1's ratio is 2 * (star_2's ratio). 

Alternatively, perhaps both stars have the same statistical weights for the energy levels, so g_i/g_j is the same for both. Then, the ratio (n_i/n_j) for each star would be proportional to exp( - delta_E/(k T) ). 

If (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2), then we can write:

exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta_E/(k T2) )

Wait, no, because if the ratios are in a 2:1 relationship, then maybe (n_i1/n_j1) = 2 (n_i2/n_j2). So the equation becomes:

[g_i/g_j * exp(-delta_E/(k T1))] = 2 [g_i/g_j * exp(-delta_E/(k T2))]

Assuming that g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, which they are because it's the same element and same energy levels.

So, dividing both sides by (g_i/g_j), we get:

exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta_E/(k T2) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let me denote for star_1, (n_i1/n_j1) = 2, and for star_2, (n_i2/n_j2) = 1.

Wait, but if the excitation is twice as high, that would mean that (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2). So for star_2, the ratio is (n_i2)/(n_j2) = x, and star_1's is 2x.

But if star 2's ratio is x, then star_1's is 2x. But without knowing x, maybe we can take the ratio between the two.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the excitation potential is the same, but the excitation level depends on temperature. So maybe (n_i/n_j) is proportional to exp(-delta_E/(k T)).

Wait, perhaps I should take the ratio of the two excitation ratios. So for star_1, (n_i1/n_j1) = (g_i/g_j) exp(-delta_E/(k T1)), and for star_2, (n_i2/n_j2) = (g_i/g_j) exp(-delta_E/(k T2)).

If the ratio (n_i1/n_j1) is twice (n_i2/n_j2), then:

(g_i/g_j) exp(-delta_E/(k T1)) = 2 * (g_i/g_j) exp(-delta_E/(k T2))

We can cancel (g_i/g_j) from both sides:

exp(-delta_E/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -delta_E/(k T2) )

Taking natural log of both sides:

- delta_E/(k T1) = ln(2) - delta_E/(k T2)

Rearranging:

delta_E/(k T2) - delta_E/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out delta_E/k:

delta_E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

delta_E/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = (delta_E/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, delta_E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, but let me see if that helps. Wait, but in the options, the equations don't have any constants like delta_E or k. So perhaps the equation can be rearranged to eliminate delta_E.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me go through that again.

Wait, from the previous step:

delta_E/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, no, let's re-express:

delta_E/(k T2) - delta_E/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor delta_E/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )= ln(2)

Which is delta_E/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) )= ln(2 )

So,

ln(2) = [ delta_E/(k) ] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But in the options, there's no delta_E or k. So perhaps the equation is expressed as ln(2) equals some combination of T1 and T2.

Wait, but none of the options seem to involve delta_E. So perhaps the correct option is D, which is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but in the equation I derived, it's multiplied by delta_E/(k).

Wait, but perhaps the given delta_E is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute delta_E/(k).

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So delta_E =1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k (since k≈1.38e-23 J/K). So delta_E = k * T, where T is 1 K.

Wait, because delta_E = k*T → T = delta_E/(k) → 1.38e-23 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = 1 K.

So delta_E/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting that into the equation:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, that's option D.

So the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the excitation ratio \( n_i / n_j \) is proportional to \( \exp(-\Delta E / (kT)) \), where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1, the excitation ratio is \( n_{i1} / n_{j1} = 2 \), and for star_2, it is \( n_{i2} / n_{j2} = 1 \). Dividing the equations for the two stars gives:

\[
\frac{\exp(-\Delta E / (kT_1))}{\exp(-\Delta E / (kT_2))} = 2
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = \ln(2)
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) = \ln(2)
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches option D. The correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Answer: D
