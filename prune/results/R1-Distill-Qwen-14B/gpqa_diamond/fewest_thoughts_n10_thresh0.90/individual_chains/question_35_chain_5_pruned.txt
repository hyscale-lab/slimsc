Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's equal to c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π), so that's a constant. The matrix S has the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. Wait, I remember that in angular momentum operators, the Pauli matrices often come into play. Oh wait, S here must be similar to one of the Pauli matrices. Let me recall: the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So yeah, S must be the Pauli y matrix.

So Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * σy. But wait, wait. The Pauli matrices are generally multiplied by ħ/2 in spin-1/2 systems. Oh wait, because the spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So in this case, S is the Pauli matrix, so the operator Ay would be c multiplied by S. Let me compute c: c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. Oh wait, because ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) is (ħ/2). So Ay = (ħ/2) σy. But the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvalues of Ay. So the eigenvalues a should be (ħ/2)(±1), so ± ħ/2. But wait, substituting ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π), which is c, the constant given. So the eigenvalues a are c*(±1), which would be ±c. Since c is h/(4π), that's a = ±h/(4π). Wait, but I thought σy has eigenvalues ±1, so Ay would have eigenvalues ± (h/(4π)). So the eigenvalues are real? Because in the problem statement, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So a must be real?

Wait, but wait a second. The Y-component of angular momentum operator is usually Hermitian, right? Because observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are real. So Ay must be Hermitian. Let me check if Ay is Hermitian. S is σy, which is Hermitian because σy† = σy. So since c is a real constant, Ay is c*σy, which is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues should be real. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts must be incorrect. Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So A is wrong.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2, but again, eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong too. So B is out.

Options C and D are about eigenvectors and their properties. Let's think about that.

The eigenfunctions of Ay would be eigenvectors of the σy matrix. The eigenvectors of σy are the same as those of S, which is σy. The eigenvectors for σy are [1, i] and [1, -i], up to normalization. Wait no, wait: σy has eigenvalues ±1. Let me compute it.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The characteristic equation is det(S−λI)=0. So determinant of [[–λ, -i], [i, –λ]] is λ² + (i)(i) = λ² - (1) = 0. So λ^2 =1, so λ=±1. So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvectors are for λ=1: solve (S - I) v=0.

(S - I) is [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]. The equations would be:

- v1 - i v2 =0  
i v1 - v2 =0.

From first equation, v1 = -i v2. From second equation, i v1 = v2. Substituting v1 from first into second: i*(-i v2) = v2 → (i*(-i)) v2 = v2 → (1) v2 = v2. So any multiple works. Let's choose v2=1, then v1= -i. So the eigenvector is [-i, 1], which can be written as [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly for λ=-1, the matrix S + I would be [[1, -i], [i, 1]]. Equations: v1 -i v2 =0; i v1 + v2=0. From first equation, v1 = i v2. Sub into second: i*(i v2) + v2 = (-1) v2 + v2 =0. So any multiple. Let v2=1, v1= i. So [i,1]^T.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i,
