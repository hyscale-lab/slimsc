--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. 

The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So I need to find the eigenvector of P in the direction of n, which is in the x-z plane. 

Wait, wait, I think I should first understand what the operator P is. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are represented by vectors of operators. So the operator P is a vector operator where each component (like P_x, P_y, P_z) is an operator itself.

The given components are:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

I remember that these are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvalues of these operators would be ± ħ/2, since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1.

But wait, the question is about the operator P along an arbitrary direction n. The direction n is in the x-z plane, so it's a unit vector making some angle θ with the z-axis, but I don't think θ is given. So, the operator along n would be the dot product of vector P with n, which is P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y is zero. So the operator simplifies to P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Hmm, but wait, the direction is arbitrary, but along x-z. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. But since the exact direction isn't given, perhaps the eigenvector depends on θ.

Wait, but the problem is to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find a vector |v> such that (P·n)|v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Let me write Pauli matrices as σx, σy, σz. So P_x = (ħ/2) σx, etc. So the operator we're interested in is (n_x σx + n_z σz) (ħ/2). So the matrix is (ħ/2) (n_x [[0 1],[1 0]] + n_z [[1 0],[0 -1]]).

Alternatively, it can be written as (ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. Because the (1,1) element is n_z*(1) from σz, and the (2,2) is n_z*(-1) from σz. The (1,2) and (2,1) elements are n_x*(1) from σx, but σx is [[0 1],[1 0]], so those elements become n_x. Wait, but in matrix terms, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so n_x times σx is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]. Similarly, σz is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], so n_z times σz is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. So adding them gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So the operator matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by this.

Now, to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

( n_z * ħ/2 + (n_x * ħ/2) * something )? Wait, perhaps better to set up the equation.

Let me denote the matrix as (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So the eigenvalue equation is M |v> = λ |v>, where λ is +ħ/2.

So,

( (ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] ) * [[a],[b]] = (ħ/2) [[a],[b]]

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [[a],[b]] = [[a],[b]]

Which gives the equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me write these:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Wait, no, let me re-derive.

Wait, the first component after multiplying:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
Second component: n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

So we have the system:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Hmm, to find non-trivial solutions (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Let me write the coefficient matrix:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x        ]
[ n_x         (-n_z -1) ]

The determinant is (n_z-1)(-n_z -1) - n_x^2 = 0.

Expand that: (n_z^2 -1) - n_x^2 = 0 → n_z^2 - n_x^2 = 1.

But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So substituting n_z^2 = 1 - n_x^2 into the determinant equation:

(1 - n_x^2) - n_x^2 = 1 → 1 - 2n_x^2 = 1 → -2n_x^2=0 → n_x =0.

That's interesting. So n_x must be zero. But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so n_x could be zero, but that would make it along the z-axis. But if n is in the x-z plane, n_x can be non-zero. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should think of the eigenvector in terms of spin states. For spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates of S·n (where n is a unit vector) are spin-up and spin-down along n.

So the eigenstates can be found using the eigenvalue equation S·n |↑> = (ħ/2)|↑>.

Wait, so the spin-up state along n is given by a specific spinor. Let me recall that the spinor for spin-up along the z-axis is (1, 0), and for x-axis it's (1/√2, 1/√2), and for any direction, it's a linear combination involving angles.

Alternatively, the general spin-up state along direction n=(sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) is (e^{-iφ} sinθ/2, cosθ/2). Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some conventions.

Wait, no. Let me think about it. For a general direction, the spin-up state is given by:

|+n> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of the eigenvector components.

Wait, the eigenvector for spin-up along n is (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)), where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ would be 0 or π, depending on the x-component.

Wait, no. If n is in the x-z plane, then φ is either 0 or π. Because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane corresponds to φ=0 or π. So for a direction in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or π. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me consider the problem again. The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it's of the form (a, 0, c), where a² + c² = 1.

Wait, but since the operator is P · n, and n is a unit vector, so in this case, n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π. So the unit vector would be (sinθ cos0, sinθ sin0, cosθ) = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or (sinθ cosπ, sinθ sinπ, cosθ) = (-sinθ, 0, cosθ).

But in any case, the n_x component is sinθ or -sinθ, and n_z is cosθ.

Wait, but the eigenvector's components when expressed in the computational basis (like for spin-z) will be in terms of θ and φ. Since the direction is in x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π.

So the spin-up state |+n> would be:

( cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) )

But since φ is either 0 or π in this case, e^{iφ} would be 1 or -1.

So the components would be:

If φ=0: (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))
If φ=π: (cos(θ/2), -sin(θ/2))

But wait, the options don't specify φ, so maybe the general case is considered, which includes e^{iφ}.

Looking at the options:

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which seems off because it's more like spin-1, not spin-1/2.

Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which would correspond to φ=0, θ being the polar angle. So this is a possible form.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, but I'm not sure where those come from.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by ħ, but wait, eigenvectors are typically normalized, so having ħ as a factor might not be right, unless the components are being scaled in some way.

Wait, but the operator P is given with factors of ħ/2, but eigenvectors are usually dimensionless. So perhaps the options with ħ are incorrect. So I can probably rule out option A and D, since they have factors of ħ. So eigenvectors shouldn't have dimensions of energy times time, etc. So the correct answer is likely option C or B.

Wait, but option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which aligns with spin-up along a direction θ from z, with φ=0. But what about the general case where φ is not zero?

Ah, but in the problem statement, n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so φ can be any value between 0 and 2π, but for this plane, it should be 0 or π. So the general form would involve e^{iφ}.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), but that's not matching the spinor form. Because for spin-1/2, the components are cos(θ/2) and e^{iφ} sin(θ/2).

Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which would correspond to φ=0.

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(θ/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(θ/2)), which includes a factor of ħ, which I think is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.

So the correct form is (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)), which matches option B only if the components are written as cosθ and something else, but option B's first component is cosθ, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the angles wrong. Let me think again about the spinor.

In the standard parametrization, the spin-up state along direction (θ, φ) is:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>

So the components are [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)}]^T.

So the first component is cos(θ/2), the second is e^{iφ} sin(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)), which is of the form in option C when φ=0, but in general it's the expression I wrote. 

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which is the case when φ=0. But the problem says n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so φ can be any angle, but perhaps in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, because x-z plane is φ=0 (along +x) or φ=π (along -x). So n is either (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ). 

Wait, but the eigenvector depends on the direction, so for a general direction in x-z plane, the phase factor e^{iφ} would be either 1 or -1. For example, if φ=0, e^{iφ}=1; if φ=π, e^{iφ}=-1.

So the general eigenvector should be (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)).

Looking again at the options, option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which doesn't match because the angles are θ, not θ/2.

Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which would be the case when φ=0. But the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the answer should include the phase factor e^{iφ}, but none of the options except B and C have that. 

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B says (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which seems to represent a spherical harmonic function, perhaps for l=1, m=0, but for spin-1/2, it's the θ/2 and φ terms.

Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which is correct when φ=0.

But the problem says the direction is arbitrary, so perhaps the correct answer is the general form, which would have the phase factor. But none of the options except B have that, but B's components are cosθ and sinθ, not cosθ/2.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think about the spin states again.

Wait, another approach: Let me construct the operator P·n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as n = (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

As earlier, the matrix is (ħ/2) times [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

We need to find its eigenvectors for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the equation is (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

Which gives:

( (n_z -1) a + n_x b ) =0
( n_x a + (-n_z -1) b )=0

Wait, perhaps I should set up the matrix equation again.

The matrix (P·n - λ I) is:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x         ]
[ n_x       (-n_z -1) ]

The eigenvector (a,b) must satisfy this. So the equations:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → equation (1)
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0 → equation (2)

We can solve for b from equation (1):

b = [ (1 - n_z) a ] / n_x

Assuming n_x ≠0. But wait, what if n_x is zero? Then n is along z-axis. Then from equation (1), (n_z -1) a =0. Since n_z is ±1, but since n is a unit vector, if n_x=0, n_z is 1 (along +z) or -1 (along -z).

But the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so for P·n with n along +z, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and the eigenvector would be (1,0). Similarly, for n along -z, the eigenvalue would be -ħ/2.

But in our case, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so n must have n_z positive.

Wait, no. Because P·n has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2) * |n·P| or something? No, the eigenvalues depend on the direction. So for n along z, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2 as usual.

So if n_x=0 and n_z=1, then equation (1) becomes (1-1)a + 0*b=0 → 0=0. Equation (2) becomes 0*a + (-1-1) b=0 → -2b=0 → b=0. So the eigenvector is (a, 0), with a ≠0, so normalized as (1, 0).

So the eigenvector is (1,0), which is option C when θ=0, φ=0, because cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0.

But in the general case where n_x is not zero, let's proceed.

From equation (1): b = [ (1 - n_z) a ] / n_x

Substitute into equation (2):

n_x a + (-n_z -1) [ (1 - n_z) a / n_x ] =0

Multiply through by n_x:

n_x² a + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) a =0

Factor out a:

[ n_x² + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) ] a =0

Since a isn't zero, the coefficient must be zero.

Compute the coefficient: n_x² + [ (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) ]

Expand the product:

(-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) = (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)
= -n_z + n_z² -1 + n_z
= n_z² -1

So the coefficient is n_x² + (n_z² -1 ) = (n_x² + n_z²) -1 = 1 -1 =0.

So the equation is 0*a=0, which is always true. So we have a free parameter.

Thus, the eigenvectors are of the form (a, b) where b = [ (1 - n_z) a ] / n_x.

Let me express this as:

a = any value,
b = (1 - n_z) a / n_x

We can choose a = n_x; then b = (1 - n_z).

Wait, but wait. Let me try a = n_x. Then b= (1 - n_z).

So the vector is (n_x, 1 - n_z). But we need to normalize it.

The normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² =1.

So |n_x|² + |1 - n_z|² =1.

But since n_x² + n_z² =1, we can substitute.

n_x² + (1 - 2n_z + n_z²) = n_x² +1 - 2n_z + n_z² = (n_x² + n_z²) +1 - 2n_z = 1 +1 -2n_z = 2(1 -n_z).

Wait, that's 2(1 -n_z), but that must equal 1 for normalization.

So 2(1 -n_z) =1 → 1-n_z=1/2 → n_z=1/2.

But n_z can be any value between -1 and 1, depending on the direction n. So this suggests that the choice a =n_x only works when n_z=1/2, which is not always the case. So that approach is not general.

Hmm, perhaps a better way is to express the eigenvector in terms of θ and φ.

Wait, perhaps I should parameterize n in terms of θ and φ. Since n is in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, so let me take φ=0 for simplicity.

So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Thus, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

The eigenvector is [a, b] = [a, (1 - cosθ) a / sinθ ]

So let's compute the normalization:

|a|² + |b|² = |a|² [1 + ( (1 - cosθ)^2 ) / (sinθ)^2 ) ].

Simplify the term in brackets:

[ (sin^2θ + (1 - cosθ)^2 ) ] / sin^2θ.

Compute numerator: sin²θ +1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ = (sin²θ + cos²θ) +1 - 2 cosθ = 1 +1 -2 cosθ = 2(1 - cosθ).

So the term becomes [ 2(1 - cosθ) ] / sin²θ.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So sin²θ = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2).

So substituting:

2(2 sin²(θ/2)) ) / (4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)) )

= (4 sin²(θ/2)) ) / (4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)) )

= 1 / cos²(θ/2) ) 

So the normalization factor becomes sqrt( [ 1 + ... ] ) = sqrt( 1 / cos²(θ/2) ) = 1/ |cos(θ/2)|.

So the normalized eigenvector is:

a = cos(θ/2),
b = (1 - cosθ) / sinθ * a = (2 sin²(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) * cos(θ/2)
= [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ] * cos(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] when φ=0. 

But wait, if φ= π, then n_x = -sinθ, and the calculation would be similar. Let me see:

n_x = -sinθ, n_z=cosθ.

Then, from equation (1), b = (1 - n_z) a / n_x = (1 - cosθ) a / (- sinθ) ) = - (1 - cosθ)/(sinθ) a.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So:

b = - [ 2 sin²(θ/2) / ( 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] a 
= - [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ] a 

So the vector is [a, - tan(θ/2) a ]

To normalize:

a² + [ a^2 tan²(θ/2) ] = a² (1 + tan²(θ/2) ) = a² sec²(θ/2) =1 → a = cos(θ/2).

So the vector becomes [ cos(θ/2), - sin(θ/2) ].

So the general form is [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ], where φ is 0 or π for the x-z plane.

Looking back at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which is the case when φ=0.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ ), which doesn't match the spinor form.

So the correct normalized eigenvector should have components (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)), which is the general case for arbitrary φ. But looking at the options, none of them match exactly except option C for φ=0.

Wait, but option B has components cosθ and e^{iφ} sinθ, which doesn't align with the spinor components. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, there's another possibility. Let me think again about the eigenvector equation.

Wait, when I did the eigenvector calculation earlier, I assumed n_x is not zero. But in the case where n is along the z-axis (n_x=0), the eigenvector is (1, 0), which is option C when θ=0.

Wait, in option C, when θ=0, cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0 → (1,0), which is correct.

Similarly, when θ=π, cos(π/2)=0, sin(π/2)=1 → (0,1), but the eigenvalue would be -ħ/2, but the question says the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector should correspond to when n is along +z direction.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization factors. Let's check.

Wait, the eigenvector I found is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which is option C. But why are the other options presented?

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively. That suggests a specific angle, perhaps theta=60 degrees, but the problem states an arbitrary direction.

So I think the correct answer is option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $\hbar/2$ times specific 2x2 matrices. The task is to determine the eigenvector components for the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Operator Formulation**:  
   The operator $\vec{P}$ is a vector operator, and the eigenvalue equation involves $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, where $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be written as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

   The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ simplifies to:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix},
   \]
   where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$.

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   The eigenvalue equation is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the system becomes:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \\
   n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
   \end{cases}
   \]

3. **Solution for Eigenvector**:  
   Solving the system, the eigenvector components are found to be proportional to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ e^{i\phi} \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},
   \]
   where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. For an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, $\phi$ can be 0 or $\pi$, corresponding to $n_x = \sin\theta$ or $n_x = -\sin\theta$.

4. **Normalization**:  
   The eigenvector is normalized such that $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$. Substituting the components:
   \[
   |\cos(\theta/2)|^2 + |\sin(\theta/2)|^2 = 1,
   \]
   confirming the normalization.

5. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Contains factors of $\hbar$, which are inconsistent with normalized eigenvectors (dimensionless).  
   - **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ does not match the spinor form for spin-1/2 systems, which involves $\theta/2$.  
   - **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the spinor form for $\phi = 0$, which is a valid case for $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.  
   - **Option D**: Includes factors of $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which suggest a specific angle $\theta$, but the problem specifies an arbitrary direction. Thus, this option is not general.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector for an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane is given by **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

ANSWER: C
