Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Wait, why would more massive stars have the same radius? Oh, maybe because the other star is a bit older or larger but similar in size. Interesting.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the alignment. The formula for the probability is (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, no, I think the transit probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to something else. Wait, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet), but it's actually the ratio of the size of the star and the size of the orbit.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area of the orbit. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 - (R_star/a_planet)^2 )) or something like that? Or maybe it's just (R_star / a_planet). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I remember that the transit probability is the area of the circle (from the star's perspective) divided by the area of the planet's orbit. So it's (pi * (R_star)^2) / (pi * a^2) ) which simplifies to (R_star / a)^2. No, wait, that can't be right because that would be the area ratio, but the probability isn't just the area. Oh, wait, the probability is the ratio of the star's size to the orbital distance, so P = (R_star / a) * (something else). I think the correct formula is P = (R_star / a) * (something), but I'm not exactly
