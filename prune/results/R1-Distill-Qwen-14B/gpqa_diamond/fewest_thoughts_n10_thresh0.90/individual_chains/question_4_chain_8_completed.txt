Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me try to recall each one.

The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E equals rho over epsilon_0. So ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. This relates electric fields to charges.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero. ∇·B = 0. This is why in our universe, you can't have isolated magnetic poles, right? Because if you did, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore.

3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is negative the time derivative of B. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This deals with induced electric fields due to changing magnetic fields.

4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition: The curl of B is mu_0 times J plus mu_0 epsilon_0 times the time derivative of E. ∇×B = μ₀(J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). This covers how magnetic fields relate to currents and changing electric fields.

Now, the question says in a parallel universe, magnets can have isolated North or South poles. So in that case, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. Because in our universe, ∇·B =0, which ensures that magnetic monopoles don't exist. If they do exist, then ∇·B would not be zero. So equation 2 would change.

Wait, the options are about which equations are different. Let me look at the options.

Option A: The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equation 2. So if equation 2 changes, that's one equation. But I should check the other options.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and divergence of B. So that would be equations 3 and 2. Wait, equation 3 is about the curl of E, which is Faraday's Law. So if the universe allows for magnetic monopoles, does Faraday's Law change? Hmm. Let me think about that.

In our universe, Faraday's Law is about the curl of E being related to the time derivative of B. If you have magnetic monopoles, does that affect Faraday's Law? Or only Gauss's Law for magnetism?

Wait, Maxwell's equations include the four I listed. The presence of magnetic monopoles would change equation 2 (∇·B = 0 becomes ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where μ_m is the magnetic permeability and ρ_m is the magnetic charge density). So equation 2 changes.

But what about the other equations? Let's think about Ampère's Law. Ampère's Law relates the curl of B to currents and the time derivative of E. If there are magnetic currents, would Ampère's Law need to change? Or would it be a new equation?

Wait, in the case of magnetic monopoles, there are two additional terms in Ampère's Law. Because you would have magnetic current density, J_m. So the Maxwell's equations would be modified. The Ampère's Law in that case would include magnetic current terms.

Wait, no, let me get this straight. Without magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations have four equations. With monopoles, the four equations would change in two of them.

Wait, I think that when magnetic monopoles exist, the divergence of B is non-zero (equation 2 changes), and the curl of E would have an extra term. Wait, no, Faraday's Law remains the same because it's about induced E fields due to changing B fields, which relates to how B is changing, not the sources.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Without monopoles, equations are:

∇ · B = 0 (equation 2)
∇ × E = -∂B/∂t (equation 3)
∇ × B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) (equation 4)
∇ · E = ρ/ε₀ (equation 1)

If there are monopoles, then equation 2 becomes ∇ · B = μ_m ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 changes.

What about Ampère's Law (equation 4)? In our universe, Ampère's Law relates the curl of B to the current and the displacement current. If there are magnetic currents, equation 4 would have an additional term.

Wait, I think with monopoles, the Ampère's Law (equation 4) would have a term involving J_m, the magnetic current. So equation 4 would become ∇ × B = μ₀ (J + J_m) + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. Or wait, no, perhaps the magnetic current would appear in another way.

Wait, maybe the correct way is that with magnetic monopoles, the four equations become:

∇ · E = ρ/ε₀ → equation 1 unchanged.

∇ · B = ρ_m μ_m → equation 2 changed.

∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ_m J_m → equation 3 changed? Because there's a term involving the magnetic current.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recall. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell's equations are modified in two places. Equation 2 (Gauss's Law for B) changes as divergence of B is non-zero. And equation 4 (Ampère's Law) would also change because magnetic currents would contribute to the curl of B.

Wait, another way: the usual equations are symmetric in E and B when you consider magnetic charges. So if you have magnetic charges, you can write Maxwell's equations in a symmetric way.

So the modified equations would be:

∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)
∇·B = ρ_m μ₀ (new, equation 2)
∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (equation 3, now includes J_m)
∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e (equation 4, now includes J_e)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me think. Without magnetic monopoles, equation 4 is:

∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

If there are magnetic currents, then perhaps the equation for the curl of E and the curl of B would each get an extra term. Because in the symmetric case, you have for both E and B similar terms.

So, perhaps equation 3 becomes:

∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

And equation 4 becomes:

∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + (something involving J_m?)

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the modified Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles. Let me recall that.

In such a scenario, the four equations become:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀ → unchanged.

2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m → equation 2 changed.

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m → equation 3 changed.

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e → equation 4, where J_e is the electric current. But wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, would equation 4 change? Because Ampère's Law in our universe already includes the displacement current. So if there's a magnetic current, does equation 4 get a term from that?

Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 would have a term involving J_m. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: in the absence of magnetic monopoles, the four equations have ∇·B=0 and ∇×E=-∂B/∂t. If monopoles exist, then ∇·B = something (non-zero), and perhaps ∇×E would have an additional term involving the magnetic current.

So, which equations change? Equations 2 and 3.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options are about which equations are different. So the modified Maxwell's equations would have equations 2 and 3 changed? Or equations 2 and 4?

Wait, the question says: which of Maxwell’s equations look different. So the two equations that are modified are the ones involving the divergence of B and the curl of E.

So in the options, let's look.

Option C says: the ones related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. Wait, what's the circulation of the magnetic field? That's the curl of B (∇×B), which is Ampère's law. The flux of the electric field, I'm not sure. Wait, no—Gauss's law for E is about divergence of E, not flux.

Wait, option C says "the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field." Hmm, I'm not sure if that's right.

Alternatively, option B says: the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. That would be equations 3 and 2. That's the two that we thought would change.

Option D says: the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. That would be equations 2 and 4. Because equation 2 is divergence of B, equation 4 is curl of B.

Wait, but in our scenario, equation 2's divergence of B changes, and equation 3's curl of E changes. So equation 3 is about the curl of E, which is the circulation of E.

Wait, the options:

Option C) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field.

Wait, the 'circulation of the magnetic field' is the curl of B. The flux of the electric field is the integral of E over a surface, which is ∫E·dA, which is related to the divergence of E (Gauss's law). So option C is about ∇×B and ∇·E? But in our scenario, ∇·E remains the same, only ∇·B and ∇×E change.

So which options are correct?

Wait, the question is about which equations are different. So two equations would change: equation 2 and equation 3.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Related to the circulation of E and the divergence of B.

Which would be equations 3 and 2. So that's two equations.

Option D: The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So that's equations 2 (∇·B) and 4 (∇×B). Because equation 4 is the curl of B.

Wait, equation 4 in our scenario would also change because if you have magnetic monopoles, you might have magnetic current terms. So equation 4 would have a term involving J_m (magnetic current).

Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again.

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell's equations are:

∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m → equation 2.

∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m → equation 3.

∇ × B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e → equation 4.

Wait, no. Because without magnetic monopoles, Ampère's Law is equation 4: ∇ × B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. If there are magnetic currents, equation 4 would need to include a term for J_m as well. So equation 4 would become:

∇ × B = μ₀ (J_e + J_m) + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 doesn't change, but equation 3 gains a term.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.

In our universe, the modified Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles are:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀ → same.

2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m → equation 2 changed.

3. ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m → equation 3 changed.

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t → same as before? Or equation 4 also changes.

Wait, I think that in the presence of magnetic monopoles, equation 4 would remain the same if the magnetic current is handled elsewhere. Or perhaps equation 4 gets another term.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 would have a term involving J_m. Because in the symmetric formulation, the equations for E and B are similar. So equation 4 would become:

∇ × B = μ₀ (J_e + J_m) + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another source I remember says that when magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations are modified. So equation 2 (div B) and equation 3 (curl E) are the ones that change.

Wait, but another approach: in the original Maxwell's equations, the curl of E is related to the time derivative of B, but with magnetic monopoles, there's also a term for the magnetic current density in Ampère's Law.

Wait, no. Oh wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the symmetry suggests that the equations for E and B would mirror each other. So equation 2 and equation 4 would each have similar terms.

Wait, perhaps this is the correct way:

Original equations:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀.

2. ∇·B = 0.

3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t.

4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

With magnetic monopoles:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀.

2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m.

3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m.

4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

Wait, no, because Ampère's Law (equation 4) would need to include a term for J_m, but in the symmetric equations, perhaps equation 4 would have a term involving the magnetic current.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the standard formulation.

In the standard (without monopoles):

Equation 2: ∇·B = 0.

Equation 3: ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t.

Equation 4: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

If monopoles exist, then equation 2 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m.

Equation 3 would have an additional term for the magnetic current. So equation 3 becomes ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m.

But in equation 4, perhaps the magnetic current would appear, leading it to be ∇×B = μ₀ (J_e + J_m) + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 remains the same, and the magnetic current appears elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe equation 4 doesn't change, but equation 3 gains a term, and equation 2 changes.

So in this case, the two equations that are different are equation 2 (divergence of B) and equation 3 (curl of E).

So which option matches that?

Looking back at the options:

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.

Circulation of the electric field is the curl of E (equation 3). Divergence of B is equation 2.

So option B says these two equations are different, which would be correct.

Wait, but another option, D, says divergence and curl of the magnetic field. So that would be equations 2 and 4.

Because equation 4 is the curl of B.

So in our case, equation 2 and equation 3 change, but equation 4 may or may not change.

Wait, earlier I thought equation 4 would not change. Because equation 4 is ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. But if magnetic monopoles exist, there's a current of magnetic charge, which would have to appear in another equation—maybe equation 4, or maybe a new term in equation 3.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 would have a term involving J_m. Let me think.

Wait, in the symmetric case, you'd have for E and B:

Equation 1: ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀.

Equation 2: ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m.

Equation 3: ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m.

Equation 4: ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

Wait, but now equation 4 is Ampère's Law. Without monopoles, equation 4 has J_e and the displacement term. If there are magnetic monopoles, perhaps equation 4 would not include J_m, but equation 3 would have a J_m term.

Wait, this is getting a bit unclear. Let me think about which equations are modified.

In the universe with monopoles:

- Gauss's Law for B (equation 2) changes because divergence of B is non-zero.

- Faraday's Law (equation 3) would have an additional term because of magnetic current. So equation 3 changes.

Do the other equations (equation 1 and 4) change? Equation 1 is about electric charge, so it remains the same. Equation 4, Ampère's Law, relates to electric currents and displacement current. Without a magnetic current term in Ampère's Law, equation 4 remains the same? Or would it need to include J_m?

Wait, maybe Ampère's Law would include a term for J_m. Because in the absence of monopoles, equation 4 is about the curl of B being proportional to J and displacement current. If you have J_m, perhaps equation 4 would have something like J_e + J_m. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 remains the same because J_m is handled in equation 3. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

But the original question is, which equations are different? The options are:

A) Only equation 2.

B) Equations 3 and 2.

C) Equations 3 and something else.

D) Equations 2 and 4.

Hmm.

Wait, let me make a table:

In our universe:

1. ∇·E = rho / eps0 → no change.

2. ∇·B = 0 → changes to ∇·B = mu0 rho_m.

3. ∇×E = -dB/dt → may change if J_m exists.

4. ∇×B = mu0 J + mu0 eps0 dE/dt → may change.

If we have J_m, then equation 3 would have ∇×E = - dB/dt - mu0 J_m.

So equation 3 changes.

So the equations that change are 2 and 3.

Which option matches that?

Option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field (equation 3) and the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2). So option B.

Alternatively, option D says the divergence and curl of the magnetic field, which would be equations 2 and 4. So that would imply that equation 4 changes.

But according to my earlier reasoning, equation 3 and 2 change. So option B is correct.


In a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles, the existence of magnetic monopoles modifies two of Maxwell's equations. These modifications arise because the presence of magnetic monopoles introduces magnetic charge density and magnetic current density, which affect the symmetry of the equations.

### Analysis of Maxwell's Equations:
1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity (∇·E = ρ/ε₀):**  
   This equation remains unchanged because it relates electric fields to electric charges, which are unaffected by the presence of magnetic monopoles.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇·B = 0):**  
   In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, ensuring the non-existence of isolated magnetic poles. However, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation changes to:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m,$$  
   where $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density. Thus, this equation is modified.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction (∇×E = -∂B/∂t):**  
   In our universe, this equation describes the induced electric field due to a time-varying magnetic field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, the presence of magnetic current density ($\mathbf{J}_m$) modifies this equation to:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m.$$  
   Therefore, this equation is also modified.

4. **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition (∇×B = μ₀(J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t)):**  
   This equation relates the curl of the magnetic field to electric currents and the displacement current. While the presence of magnetic monopoles introduces magnetic currents, these are accounted for in the modified Faraday's Law (equation 3) rather than directly altering Ampère's Law. Thus, this equation remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The two equations that are different in a universe with magnetic monopoles are:  
- **Equation 2:** The divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B).  
- **Equation 3:** The circulation of the electric field (∇×E).  

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Only the divergence of the magnetic field changes. This is incorrect because Faraday's Law (equation 3) also changes.  
- **Option B:** The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. This is correct, as both equations 2 and 3 are modified.  
- **Option C:** The ones related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. This is incorrect because the flux of the electric field (equation 1) remains unchanged, and the circulation of the magnetic field (equation 4) does not change.  
- **Option D:** The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. This is incorrect because the curl of the magnetic field (equation 4) does not change.

### Final Answer:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as both the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field are modified in the presence of magnetic monopoles.

Answer: B
