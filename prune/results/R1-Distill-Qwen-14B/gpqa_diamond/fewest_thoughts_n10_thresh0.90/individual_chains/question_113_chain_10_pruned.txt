Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are different chemical formulas, and I need to pick the right one based on the data provided.

First, I'll start by going through each piece of data one by one and see what information each gives about the compound.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching because the hydrogen bonds can vary in strength, leading to a broad peak. So that makes me think the compound has either an -OH group or perhaps a carbonyl group, but wait, another peak is at 1700 cm⁻¹. Oh, the 1700 is a strong peak, which is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Then there's another peak at 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what that could be. Let me think. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl group, maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, like an aromatic ester or something. Or maybe it's an amide, but the options don't include nitrogen, so probably not. Another possibility is that it's a C=C stretch, but those are usually around 1600-1650. Wait, so if both 1700 and 1650 are present, maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and maybe a conjugated double bond? Or perhaps an ester or a ketone combined with something else.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, typically in the range of 4.5-7 ppm and can be deshielded. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the molecule has a double bond, perhaps conjugated or isolated. 

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about what fragments could give that. 45 is a common mass for a fragment. One possibility is the CH3CO+ ion, which is 43, but wait, 45 would be different. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH2)3O or something else. Alternatively, 45 could be the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (15 for O, 12*2 + 3*1=27 for (CH3)2). But wait, (CH3)2O is 31? Or wait, 12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH2CH2O (which doesn't make sense). Another possibility is that 45 could come from a ketone group. Wait, maybe the fragment is CH2CH2CHO? No, that's probably not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl ester losing some parts. Wait, another approach: 45 corresponds to the molecular formula of a fragment. Let's see, possible fragments: like a fragment with formula C3H7O, which would be 3*12 +7*1 +16=36+7+16=59. No, that's too big. Another approach: 45 could be a (CH2)2O group? Let's calculate: (CH2)2O is O plus two CH2 groups. So O is 16, each CH2 is 14 (12+2). So 16 + 2*14=44. But that's 44, not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CO group: CH2CO is 12+2 +12 +16=42. Hmm, not 45. Or perhaps an ethyl group attached to something else. Wait, maybe it's a COCH3 group, which is 43 (12 +16 +15?), but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion breaks down in a way that gives a fragment of 45.

Let me think about the molecular formulas in the options. The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight would be 6*12 +12*1 +2*16=72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114.

D) C6H12O: 72 +12 +16=100.

So the compound's molecular weight is either 116, 98, 114, or 100. The mass spectrum shows a peak at m/z=45. So that's a fragment. Let me think about which of these could give a fragment of 45.

If the compound is C6H10O2 (option C), its molecular weight is 114. Could it lose a fragment of 45? So 114 -45=69. Does 69 make sense as a possible fragment? Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks into a smaller part with 45. Let me think about the possible structures. If the molecule has an ester group, for example, which would have the structure R-O-CO-R'. Esters typically lose the R-O-CO part as a fragment. Alternatively, if it's a cyclic ester, but that's more of a lactone.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an aromatic ester, like methyl benzoate. Let's think about methyl benzoate's structure: it's benzene ring with a -O-CO-OCH3 group. Wait, no, methyl benzoate is benzene with an ester group, O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, the structure is benzene ring with a COOCH3 substituent. So the molecular formula would be C8H8O2, but that's not one of our options. Hmm, so maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, the options have C6H10O2, which would be a formula with six carbons, 10 hydrogens, and two oxygens. So maybe it's something like a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is a five-membered ring, but that's four carbons and oxygen. Alternatively, maybe a larger ring. Alternatively, maybe an ester with a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester? Or maybe a molecule with both an ester and a hydroxyl group. But let's think about the IR data again.

The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak around 2500-3300. However, the question says it's very broad at 3000, which could fit either. But if it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700. But in the IR, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700, but the 1650 might be something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's an aromatic ring with an ester group. The ester carbonyl is around 1700, and the aromatic C=C would be around 1650. Alternatively, if it's an aromatic ring with a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone, perhaps. But then, the 1700 would be the ketone, and the 1650 might be the ring's C=C stretching.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the molecule has a double bond, perhaps an aromatic ring, which would have multiple hydrogens. Alternatively, it could be a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-), but that's less likely if it's a six-carbon compound.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures based on the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: esters, or diols with ketones, but more likely an ester. Alternatively, a cyclic ester (lactone).

Option B: C6H10O: a ketone or an alcohol. But the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which would fit an alcohol's O-H. But also, the IR has a peak at 1700 which suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps a ketone. But wait, a ketone's carbonyl is around 1700, so in that case, the O-H might not be present. Hmm, but the broad peak at 3000 might be from an alcohol. So if it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would complicate the formula. Let me check the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Degrees of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12, O=2.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. (2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2 degrees. So either two double bonds, a double bond and a ring, or two rings.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6+2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2 degrees. So same as option B.

Option D: C6H12O. (2*6+2-12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which indicates at least one double bond. So the degrees of unsaturation should account for that plus any rings or other double bonds.

So, for example, if the compound has one double bond (vinyl) and a ring, that would be two degrees, so the formula would have two degrees.

Looking back, options B and C have two degrees. So the correct formula is either B or C.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl at 1700, which is another double bond (the C=O). So that's another degree. So we need to account for that.

So the degrees of unsaturation for the formula would be:

If the compound has a double bond (like vinyl), a carbonyl (another double bond), and maybe a ring.

Wait, let me re-calculate:

For each compound, the number of degrees of unsaturation is:

For option B: C6H10O. Degrees = (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

So two degrees: perhaps one double bond (like a vinyl) and one ring, or two double bonds.

But if there's a carbonyl group (C=O), that's another double bond. So the degrees would then be 3, which isn't possible because the formula only allows two. Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a carbonyl group and a ring. Let's think:

If a compound has a carbonyl (C=O) and a ring, that's two degrees (one for each), but then the vinyl would require a third? Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, the vinyl group is a double bond (CH2=CH-), which is a double bond, so that's one degree. The carbonyl is another (C=O), so that's two degrees. If the compound has a ring, that's a third degree. But the options B and C only have two degrees. So perhaps the compound only has one double bond (the vinyl) and a ring, but then where is the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the carbonyl is conjugated with the ring. Like in an aromatic ring, the C=O is part of the ring? No, that's not typical. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester group attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like an ester with a vinyl group. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Such as methyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that would have the formula C4H6O2. Our options are C6. So perhaps a similar structure but with a benzene ring. For example, a vinyl ester of benzoic acid. Wait, but benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Hmm, not matching the options.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. Like a lactone with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the mass spectrum fragment of m/z=45. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could correspond to a (CH2)3O+ group? No, that's 3*(14) +16= 46. No. Or maybe a (CH3)2CHO+? Let's see: (CH3)2CHO is C4H8O. The molecular weight would be (12*4)+(8*1)+(16*1) =48 +8 +16=72. No, that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2CH2OCH3? That would be a larger fragment.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion (CH2CO⁺), which has a mass of 43 (12 +2 +12 +16=42? Wait, no. Let me think: a ketene is O=C=CH2, but that would be a neutral molecule, not a fragment. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH3CO-O- something. Wait, another approach: 45 could be a (CH3COO-) group. Wait, CH3COO- is 60 (12*2 + 3*1 + 16*2 + 1 from charge? No, that's not right. Wait, the mass of CH3COO- would be 12*2 +3 +16*2 +1 (since charged). But the fragment is at m/z=45, so that's a neutral fragment. Let me compute: CH3COO- would be 60, but that's higher than 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is CH2CH2O+, but that's 44. Close, but not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the loss of a larger group. Let's think about the molecular formulas again. If the molecule is C6H10O2 (option C), which has a molecular weight of 114. If it breaks into a fragment of 45, the remaining would be 114-45=69. 69 could be a possible fragment, maybe a benzene ring with something attached.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. Let me think about the options again.

The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which suggests an -OH group. So the compound is either a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, or perhaps an ester with a hydroxyl group (but that's less common).

Wait, but in the IR, there's a strong peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So if it's an ester, then the carbonyl would be around 1700-1760 cm⁻¹. So perhaps the compound is an ester with an -OH group. But wait, that's possible in a hemiacetal or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a methyl ester of a substituted benzoic acid. But then, the formula would be C8H8O2, which isn't one of the options. So that's not it.

Alternatively, the compound might be a diester, but that's less likely with the given options.
