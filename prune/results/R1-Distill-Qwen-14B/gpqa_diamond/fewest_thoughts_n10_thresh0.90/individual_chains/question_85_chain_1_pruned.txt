Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Both planets are detected via transit and radial velocity methods.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have same albedo, so that might not matter. They're in circular orbits.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So, equilibrium temperature, I remember, depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula I think is T = [(L/(16πσ D² (1-A)))]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, D is the distance, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann, and A is albedo.

Wait, but the formula can be simplified if we know the star's properties. Oh right, the star's luminosity can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR_star²σTeff^4. So L is proportional to R² T_eff^4. 

So for the equilibrium temperature of a planet, the formula is:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) * ( ( M_planet / M_star )^(something) ) ... Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mass of the planet doesn't directly affect the equilibrium temperature. Because equilibrium temperature is about energy balance, which depends on the star's output and the planet's distance. The planet's mass affects things like orbital velocity or the RV method's measurements, but not the temperature.

But wait, the question gives data about the RV shifts. Oh, but for equilibrium temperature, the planet's mass doesn't matter. So, maybe the RV data is a red herring, or perhaps it's used to find the mass of the planet, but since equilibrium temp doesn't depend on planet mass, I can ignore that info except for what's needed to calculate other parameters.

Wait, the RV method gives us the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV shift is due to the Doppler effect. The formula for RV semi-amplitude K is: K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1 / (1 + M_planet/M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + (M_planet/(M_star))^(1/3) )^(1/2) ) ) ? No, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Maybe a better approach is to recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) * c ) ) )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), the equation simplifies. Also, since M_planet is much less than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So the formula for K simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_planet ) / ( (M_star)^2 ) )^(1/3) * (1 / c) ) multiplied by something else... Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula correctly.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) / (2π * (1 - e²)^0.5 * c) ) * (1 / ( (1 + (M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the formula from memory. Oh right, the correct formula is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) ] / ( (2π * (1 - e²)^0.5 * c ) )

Given that M_p << M_*, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) * (2 π c ) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

But because e=0 (circular orbit), the denominator becomes 1.

So K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) * 2 π c ) ) 

Wait, perhaps I can approach this differently. Since the problem gives the Doppler shifts (0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2), and the same line is used, the K (semi-amplitude) is proportional to the Doppler shift. So, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes would relate to the RV shifts.

Wait, the question says both planets induce a periodic shift in the [OI] line. The shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The RV measurements are the same line, so their semi-amplitudes are in the ratio of 0.03/0.04 = 3/4.

Wait, but RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the distance (semi-major axis). So, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But in this case, both planets orbit the same star, so M_* is same. e=0, so no issue. Also, the orbital periods can be determined via Kepler's third law.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I need to go into the RV semi-amplitude to find the planet's distances. Because the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance D from the star.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (D1 and D2) of the two planets, which would help in finding the equilibrium temperature ratio.

Given that equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L / D² )^(1/4). Since L is the star's luminosity, which is given, so L1 = L2 (same star), so T1 / T2 = (D2 / D1 )^0.5.

So I need to find D1 and D2 for the two planets.

But how? Because the RV semi-amplitude K is given. So K is related to M_p, M_*, period, and D.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) / ( (2 π c) / P ) ) * something... Hmm, perhaps I should recall the correct formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for K is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * (1 - e² )^(1/2) * c ) * ( (1 / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (P )^(-1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the expression for the RV semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = [ ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) ] * ( 1 / (2 π c) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e² )^(1/2) ) )

But since e=0, this simplifies.

So,

K = ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * 2 π c ) )

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, another formula I remember is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( ( G )^(1/3) ) / (
