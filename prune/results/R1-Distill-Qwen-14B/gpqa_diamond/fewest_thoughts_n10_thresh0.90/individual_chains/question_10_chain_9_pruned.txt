Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are A to D, each corresponding to one of a-d. 

So, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. The formula is density = mass/volume. Since volume is proportional to the radius cubed (because volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³), if two planets have the same composition, their densities should be similar because both mass and radius scale in a certain way.

Let's look at each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet would have that density.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the question says which one has the highest density. So this planet's density is given as 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition as Earth means same density, right? Because density depends on what it's made of. So if Earth's density is 5.5, this planet's density is the same. But wait, mass is 5 times more. Since density is mass/volume, and mass increases by 5, but what about the radius? Let's think. If the composition is same, then mass is proportional to radius cubed. Because mass scales with volume, and volume with radius³. So for Earth, mass M, radius R. For a planet with 5M, the radius would be (5)^(1/3) times R, which is about 1.71 times. So the volume would be (1.71)^3 ≈ 5 times Earth's volume. So the density is 5M/(5V) = M/V, same as Earth. So this planet has same density as Earth—5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same reasoning. Mass scales down by half. So the radius would be (0.5)^(1/3) times Earth's radius, about 0.7937 times. The volume would be (0.7937
