Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, no, actually, the formula is plx (in parsecs) equals 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

The problem says N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So substituting d in terms of plx, since plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx) is d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then for each unit increase in d, N increases by a factor of d^5. But wait, the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/(plx) is d, so 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes per unit range of distance. That might be a different way of putting it. So perhaps they're asking for the rate of change of N with respect to distance.

Wait, let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a region at distance d would be N = k*d^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, no. Wait, the total number of stars in a region at a certain distance isn't just a function of d. Because the region is a specific part of the sky, so perhaps the area is fixed. Wait, but the question says "in that region of the sky." So maybe it's about the number density or the surface density.

Wait, no. Let me clarify this. The number of stars observed in a region is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. Thus, 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5.

So N ∝ d^5. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because if you go further away, you'd expect fewer stars, not more. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait, no. Because when you're looking at a region of the sky, the number of stars you can see depends on how far away they are. Wait, but if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is inversely proportional to distance, 1/(plx)^5 is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases. But that seems wrong because when you look further away, you're seeing fewer stars, not more. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the number of stars in a region varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So as parallax decreases (which corresponds to increasing distance), the number of stars increases. But that would mean that as you look further away, you see more stars. That doesn't make sense because stars are more spread out. Wait, maybe I'm getting the relation wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars you see in a region might depend on the volume of space you're looking at. The volume increases with the cube of distance, so the number of stars would increase with d^3. But the question says it's varying as 1/(plx)^5. So what's 1/(plx)^5 in terms of d? Since plx = 1/d, substituting, 1/(plx)^5 = d^5.

So according to the problem, N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, N increases as the fifth power. But that seems incorrect because higher distance should mean that stars are farther apart and fewer are visible in a given area. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the actual physics here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the number of stars in the region increases with the number of stars within a certain volume. The volume grows as d^3, so the number of stars would be proportional to d^3. But according to the problem, it's varying as 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5. So the question is how does the number change with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) would be increasing rapidly as you go further.

But wait, the question is phrased as: How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Hmm. Maybe I need to think in terms of differential number. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to the surface area of the shell multiplied by the volume element, but perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, if N is proportional to d^5, then the rate of change of N with respect to d is dN/dd = 5d^4. But wait, the options don't have 5 as a coefficient; they're just looking for the functional form.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance)". So they might be asking for the change in N per unit change in r. So for each additional distance unit, how does N change.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually about the differential. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N per unit change in d is dN/dd = 5d^4. Which would mean that the number of stars increases by about 5d^4 per unit change in d. But the options don't have 5, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, but the options are about the dependence on r. So perhaps they're considering the rate as a function of r. So the number of stars in a region at a distance r is N = k * r^5. Then, the number per unit distance would be something else, but the question is about how N changes with r.

Wait no, the question is phrased as the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And since plx is 1/r (if r is in parsecs), then N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So for each unit increase in r, N increases by r^5. But that's more about the overall dependence. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5, meaning the number grows rapidly with distance. But again, this seems counterintuitive. Wait, why would the number of stars increase with distance? Because you're looking at a larger volume? Wait, no, because when you look further away, each star is dimmer, but perhaps the density of stars is such that the number increases.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the surface density, not the volume density. Wait, but I'm not sure. The problem says "in a specific region of the sky," which suggests a fixed area. So in a given area (like a certain square degree), the number of stars would be proportional to the volume along the line of sight, but that depends on distance.

Wait, no. The number of stars in a given area would depend on the depth into the galaxy. So for a specific region, as you go further away, the number of stars you can see in that region would decrease because stars are dimmer, but that's not matching the given relation. So maybe the problem is that in this specific region, the number of stars is inversely proportional to plx^5, which is directly proportional to r^5. So the number increases with r^5. But that's weird because you'd think it's the opposite.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the number of stars is higher when the parallax is lower (i.e., when distance is higher), but that's not how it works in reality. In reality, at larger distances, you can't see as many stars in a region because they're too faint. So the given relation here seems to suggest that the number of stars increases with distance, which is counterintuitive. But perhaps that's just the setup.

So going back to the question. If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So how does N change with r? It increases as r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So perhaps they want the derivative of N with respect to r, which would be dN/dr. If N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the change per unit r is proportional to r^4. But the options don't have a 5. Alternatively, perhaps they're just asking for the functional dependence, so N ∝ r^5, so the number increases with r^5, which would mean the rate is increasing as r^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A) ~ r^3, B) ~ r^5, C) ~ r^4, D) ~ r^2.

Hmm. So the question is, when you look at how the number changes with distance (per unit range), are they asking for the rate, which would be dN/dr, or just the overall dependence.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question states that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting, N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of r. So the number of stars in that region increases with r^5. So the correct answer would be B) ~ r^5.

But wait, the question is about the change with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the derivative. Let me think.

N is proportional to r^5. So dN/dr =5 r^4. So the change in N per unit change in r is proportional to r^4. So the rate of change would be proportional to r^4. But the options have C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. The question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, if the number of stars is N = k r^5, then for each increase in r by a small amount dr, the change in N would be dN =5 k r^4 dr. So the change per unit dr (i.e., the slope) is 5k r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases at a rate proportional to r^4.

So if the question is about the rate of change (dN/dr), the answer would be r^4, which is option C.

Alternatively, if the question is about the overall number, then it's r^5, which is option B.

Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. The key is to parse the question correctly.

The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

So per unit range of distance, probably meaning per unit change in r, which implies the derivative.

So the correct answer would be option C, ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = 1/r \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \) becomes \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This implies the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( dN/dr \). If \( N \propto r^5 \), then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

Thus, the rate at which the number of stars changes with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
