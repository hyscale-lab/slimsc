Okay, so I've got this question about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2, given a specific metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think through this.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in differential geometry, the area element is found using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Oh right, the area is the integral of the square root of det(g) over the surface.

So, let's parse the metric. It looks like it's in two dimensions because there are dx² and dy² terms. The metric tensor components are the coefficients for these terms and the cross terms. But in this case, the cross terms are zero because it's written as (dx² + dy²) multiplied by a scalar function.

So the metric tensor g is diagonal. The (1,1) component is 32/(4 - x² - y²), same for (2,2), since both dx and dy have the same coefficient. So the determinant of g is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

The area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So sqrt of [32/(4-x² - y²)]² is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Now, I need to find the total area by integrating dA over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator, 4 - x² - y², must not be zero, so the domain is where 4 - x² - y² >0, because if it's zero or negative, the metric blows up or becomes imaginary, which doesn't make sense.

So the region is x² + y² < 4. That's a circle of radius 2 in the xy-plane. So the integration is over the disk x² + y² < 4.

So the area A is the integral over this circle of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, how to set up this integral? Maybe switching to polar coordinates would make it easier. Yeah, because the region is a circle, and the integrand has radial symmetry.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So x² + y² = r². The integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dθ dr

Because dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first. The θ integral is straightforward. The integrand doesn't depend on θ, so integrating from 0 to 2π just multiplies by 2π.

So A = ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r * 2π dr

Simplify this: 32 * 2π = 64π. So A = 64π ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr

Hmm, this integral. Let's make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to 0) [ (-1/2) * (1/u) ] du.

Wait, the limits flip because when r increases, u decreases. So the integral from u=4 to u=0 would be the same as integrating from 0 to 4 with a negative sign. Let me write it out:

∫ r/(4-r²) dr = ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = ( -1/2 ) ∫ du/(u) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is ( -1/2 ) [ ln|u| ] from 4 to 0. But wait, when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. Wait, but the substitution gives:

Original r goes from 0 to 2. So u goes from 4 down to 0. So when we switch the limits, it becomes ∫ from 0 to 4, but with the negative sign.

Wait, perhaps I should express it as:

A = 64π * (1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) (-du)

Which becomes 32π ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

Wait, that's 32π times the integral from 0 to 4 of (1/u) du. But the integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so:

32π [ ln(4) - ln(0) ].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this would be 32π ( ln4 - (-infty) ), which is 32π (infty) → infinity.

Wait, but wait a second. If the integral goes to u approaching zero from the positive side, the denominator approaches zero, making 1/u blow up. So the integral ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/u) du diverges to infinity. So the area A is infinite.

So the area is infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The metric given is for a pseudosphere, which is a surface with constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere is indeed infinite, because as you approach the edge (where r approaches 2), the area element becomes larger and larger, leading to an infinite total area.

Ah, I think that's right. So the area is infinite, so the correct answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element \( dA \), which is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric is diagonal, with components \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The determinant of the metric is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is where the metric is defined, which requires \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \). This corresponds to the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), a circle of radius 2 in the \( xy \)-plane. To compute the total area, we integrate \( dA \) over this region:

\[
A = \int_{x^2 + y^2 < 4} \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral is straightforward, as the integrand does not depend on \( \theta \):

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the total area \( A \) is infinite.

The area of the pseudosphere is infinite, which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
