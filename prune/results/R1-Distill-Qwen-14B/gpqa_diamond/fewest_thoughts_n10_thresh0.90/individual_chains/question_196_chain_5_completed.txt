Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by understanding the question.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, so in the relativistic case, the equations are different from the classical case, right? Because at high speeds, relativistic effects come into play. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But in relativity, energy considerations change because of the total energy being gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Let me recall the setup for a harmonic oscillator. In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². The maximum kinetic energy is when the potential is zero (at the equilibrium point), so the speed is maximum there. The total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². At maximum displacement, all energy is potential, and at equilibrium, all is kinetic.

But wait, this is a relativistic oscillator. Oh right, relativistic harmonic oscillators are a bit more complicated because the equations of motion change. The potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. It should be part of the total relativistic energy.

In special relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But wait, in the case of oscillations, the particle's energy is oscillating between kinetic and potential. So perhaps the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.

Wait, but for small amplitudes, the classical approach holds. But for large amplitudes, relativistic effects are significant. So the maximum speed would approach c, but not exceed it.

So, let me think about the setup. The system is a harmonic oscillator with relativistic effects. The equation of motion is different. The Lagrangian for a relativistic oscillator might involve terms that include the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential.

Alternatively, the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator can be written using the force law, but considering relativistic mass. Wait, no, the concept of relativistic mass is a bit outdated; instead, we use energy and momentum with gamma factors.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this using energy conservation. The total energy in the system is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The total mechanical energy in the relativistic case should be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy (which is (gamma -1)mc²) and the potential energy (1/2 k x²). Or maybe I should think of the total energy as being made up of the rest energy plus the potential and kinetic. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy (excluding rest energy) would oscillate between kinetic and potential.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a system where the total energy (including rest energy) is conserved. So, at the maximum displacement (x = A), the kinetic energy is minimal, and the potential is maximum. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic.

So, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic plus potential. But wait, in the classical case, the potential and kinetic energies sum to a constant, but in the relativistic case, maybe the rest energy is separate.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the total energy (including rest energy) is the sum of the kinetic and potential. But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about it.

In the classical case, E_total = (1/2)kA², and when the mass is at x=0, all that energy is kinetic (1/2 mv²), giving v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But that's the classical case.

But this question is about the relativistic case. So how does it differ?

In relativity, the kinetic energy (K) is (gamma -1) mc². The potential energy (U) is (1/2)k x². The total mechanical energy (E) is then K + U + mc²? Or is E = K + U? Wait, no. Wait, the total energy in relativity is E = gamma mc². So, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy.

So, if the oscillator is at rest, E would just be mc². But when it's moving and oscillating, the energy comes from the potential and kinetic. But I'm a bit confused about how the energy is partitioned.

Wait, perhaps for the relativistic oscillator, the total energy is E = gamma mc², and when it's at the maximum displacement x=A, all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA² + mc². But wait, that doesn't seem right because then E would be mc² plus the potential energy, but that would imply that when the mass is at rest (x=A), the kinetic energy is zero, so gamma is 1. So E would be mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, when the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, so E would be (1/2)kA² + mc²? No, that doesn't make sense because at x=0, the potential is zero, so E should be mc² plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach this differently. Let me think about the energy conservation.

At the maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is zero (classically), but in reality, in the relativistic case, even when the mass is at x=A, it's momentarily at rest, so kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy is the sum of rest energy and potential.

Wait, no. That can't be right because the potential energy would have to contribute to the total energy. Wait, but in relativity, the potential energy is a form of energy, so it should contribute to the total energy.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is (1/2)kA² (the maximum potential) plus the rest energy mc², because at x=A, the kinetic energy is zero. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But then, when the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So E_total should also be equal to the relativistic kinetic energy plus the rest energy. Wait, no. Wait, the total energy is mc² plus the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) mc². So E_total = gamma mc².

So, at x=0, the potential is zero, so the total energy is just the kinetic energy plus rest energy. So E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy. But K is (gamma -1) mc², so E = gamma mc².

But E must also equal mc² + (1/2)kA², as that's the total energy when x=A. So setting them equal:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but that can't be right because at x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy would be mc² + (1/2)kA². But in reality, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic plus potential, so maybe I should think of E = mc² + K + U. Hmm, but then I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy E (excluding rest energy) is (1/2)kA², which is the same as the classical case. Then, the total energy is E_total = mc² + E, where E is the mechanical energy. So, when the mass is at x=A, the mechanical energy is all potential, so E = (1/2)kA². When it's at x=0, the mechanical energy is all kinetic, so E = K.

So, E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA², which must equal the total relativistic energy at x=0, which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy: E_total = mc² + K.

Setting them equal: mc² + (1/2)kA² = mc² + K. So, K = (1/2)kA².

But K is also (gamma -1) mc². So,

(gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So, gamma -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, that gives gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call this equation (1). So, I can solve for v_max.

Let me rearrange equation (1):

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) = [ (2 m c^2) + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 ).

Wait, maybe it's better to let me write:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) = [2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Wait, perhaps that's a miscalculation. Let me compute it correctly:

Wait, (1 + x) equals (something). So, x is (k A²)/(2 m c^2). So, gamma = 1 + x.

So,

gamma = 1 + x.

But gamma is 1/√(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/√(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + x.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + x)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + x)^2.

Rearranging:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + x)^2 ].

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 ].

But x is (k A²)/(2 m c^2). So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ].

Take the square root:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Wait, looking at the options, let me see:

Option D says v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy setup.

Wait, let me double-check. I assumed that the total mechanical energy (excluding rest energy) is (1/2)k A^2, which is the same as the classical case. So, when the mass is at x=0, all that energy is kinetic, so E_kinetic = (1/2)k A^2.

But in relativistic terms, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c^2. So,

(gamma -1) m c^2 = (1/2)k A^2.

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is what I used earlier. So, that part looks correct.

So, the expression for v_max becomes as I derived. So, the correct option should be D.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c²)))^2 )

Yes, that's the same as what I derived.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic equation of motion. The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is more complex, but perhaps I can use energy conservation another way.

Wait, another approach: The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator can be written as d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But that's a differential equation. Let's see if I can get the velocity at the equilibrium point (x=0).

Wait, but when x=0, the acceleration is zero, so it's a point of maximum velocity. So, perhaps I can find the velocity when x=0 by integrating the equation of motion. But that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, using energy conservation is probably the right approach.

So, I think my earlier approach is correct, leading to option D as the correct answer.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we analyze the system using energy conservation. The oscillator has mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeys Hooke's law \( F = -kx \). The speed of light is \( c \).

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the system includes the rest energy \( mc^2 \), the relativistic kinetic energy, and the potential energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is maximized, and the kinetic energy is zero. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic. The total energy at this point is:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Solving for \( v_{\text{max}}^2 \):

\[
v_{\text{max}}^2 = c^2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}\right).
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**D) \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}} \).**

Answer: D
