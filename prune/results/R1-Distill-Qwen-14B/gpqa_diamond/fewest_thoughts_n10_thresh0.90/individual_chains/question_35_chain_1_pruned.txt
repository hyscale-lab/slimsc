Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator which is given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h over 4π. Oh wait, S is another matrix. The first row of S is (0 -i) and the second row is (i 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The question is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to find its eigenvalues and see which of the options (A to D) is correct.

Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. Let me first write down the matrix Ay properly.

Wait, let me compute Ay:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

So the matrix elements are:

Ay[1][1] = 0
Ay[1][2] = -(i h)/(4π)
Ay[2][1] = (i h)/(4π)
Ay[2][2] = 0

So the matrix is:

[0, (-i h)/(4π)]
[(i h)/(4π), 0]

The characteristic equation is determinant of (Ay - λ I) = 0.

So,

| (-λ)      (-i h/(4π)) | 
|(i h/(4π))  (-λ)       |  = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π))*( -i h/(4π) ) ].

Calculating each part:

First term: λ².

Second term: (i * (-i)) (h/(4π))^2.

Wait, (i * (-i)) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So the second term is 1*(h^2)/( (4π)^2 ).

So the determinant is λ² - (h^2)/(16 π²) )=0.

So λ² = h^2/(16 π²)

Taking square roots: λ = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait a second. Hmm, the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4 π). But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the determinant was:

( -λ )*( -λ ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

So (i)*(-i) is -i^2, which is -(-1)=1. So it's (i * (-i)) = 1. So the product inside is (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) = (i*(-i))*(h^2/(4π)^2) ) = (1)*(h^2/(16 π²)).

So determinant equation: λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) )=0 → λ²= (h/(4π))² → λ= ± h/(4π )

So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4 π ). Wait, but wait. The problem statement says that Ay = c S, where c is h/(4π), and S is that matrix. So each eigenvalue of Ay is c times the eigenvalues of S. Because if S has eigenvalues s, then Ay has eigenvalues c * s.

So what are the eigenvalues of S? Let's compute them. Since S is a 2x2 matrix.

S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]

The trace is 0, and determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i²) = 0 - (-(-1)) = 0 - (1) → determinant is -1? Wait no,
