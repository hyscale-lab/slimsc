Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. 

Hmm, wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. So the Ca-EDTA complex must be a complex ion where EDTA is bound to Ca²+.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Because the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex, the free [Ca²+] would be low, right? Because most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex.

I think I need to use the formation constant (K) to relate the concentration of the complex to the concentrations of the individual ions. The formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. 

So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I'm assuming that the complex is dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, and I need to find the [Ca²+] in the solution.

At first, I might think that the concentration of Ca²+ is the same as the concentration of the complex because they form a 1:1 ratio. But no, because the formation constant is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the [Ca²+] would be very low, much less than 0.02 M.

So let me model this. Let's say the concentration of the complex is [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x, where x is the amount that dissociates. But since K is so large, x will be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

When the complex dissociates, it releases x amount of Ca²+ and x amount of EDTA^4−. So [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4−] = x.

Putting this into the K expression: K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) → 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) → 2/(5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x is the square root of 4e-13. sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So x = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7
