Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, I think this might actually be a pure state. Let me check. For a qubit, a pure state can be written as |ψ><ψ|. If the density matrix is a sum of projectors onto orthogonal states, each multiplied by their probabilities, then it's a mixed state.

But wait, in this case, the coefficients are 1/2 for each term. So |0><0| and |1><1| are each multiplied by 1/2. So rho = ½ |0><0| + ½ |1><1|. That looks like a classical mixture of states |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability. So this is a mixed state, not a pure state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Qubit space is two-dimensional, right? Oh, wait, I think when we represent density matrices, they can be visualized in the Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices are 2x2 Hermitian matrices with trace 1 and positive semi-definite.

Wait, the Bloch sphere represents pure states as points on the surface, and mixed states as points inside. So what's the Bloch vector for this rho?

The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (rx, ry, rz). So when you expand that, you get a matrix with elements:

(1 + rz)/2   (rx - i ry)/2
(rx + i ry)/2   (1 - rz)/2

So for our rho, let's compute it. Let me write rho explicitly. The given rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let's compute each term.

|0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then, rho is (1/2) I.

So rho equals (I)/2. So in the standard form, that's (I + 0·σ)/2. So the vector r would be (0,0,0). Because when you compare to (I + r·σ)/2, the coefficients for σx, σy, σz are all zero.

So the Bloch vector is at the origin. That corresponds to the completely mixed state, which makes sense because each basis state is equally probable. So in the Bloch sphere, this would be the center, at (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with a probability of \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we analyze its Bloch vector representation. For a single-qubit density matrix, the general form is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the matrix elements of \(\rho\) are:

\[
\rho = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1 + r_z}{2} & \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} \\
\frac{r_x + i r_y}{2} & \frac{1 - r_z}{2}.
\end{pmatrix}
\]

For the given \(\rho\), explicitly compute the terms:

\[
\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Adding these gives the identity matrix \(I\), and scaling by \(1/2\) results in:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this to the general form \(\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), it is evident that the coefficients of \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are all zero. Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Answer: C
