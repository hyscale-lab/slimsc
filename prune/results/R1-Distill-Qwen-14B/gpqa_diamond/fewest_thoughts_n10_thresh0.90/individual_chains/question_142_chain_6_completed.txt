Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. The question is about the geometric position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out in a more matrix form. Each term |n><n| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the nth position. So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together would give [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix becomes (1/2)I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. So ρ is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]].

Wait, but what does this represent? I think when a density matrix is a multiple of the identity matrix, it's a maximally mixed state. That's like a completely random state, right? So it's in the center of the Bloch sphere, which makes me think about the Bloch representation.

In the Bloch sphere model, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector on or inside a unit sphere. The state |0> is at (1,0,0), and |1> is at (-1,0,0). Wait, no, actually, the Bloch sphere uses a coordinate system where |0> is (1,0,0) and |1> is (-1,0,0), but I might be getting that mixed up. Alternatively, the Bloch vector for a pure state |θ,φ> is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). 

But wait, the density matrix for a pure state is a projector. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture. The maximally mixed state, which ρ seems to be, has all the off-diagonal terms zero, and the diagonal terms equal. So, in the Bloch sphere representation, this would correspond to the origin, because it's completely mixed. So the Bloch vector would be (0,0,0). 

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which makes sense. So the density matrix given is the maximally mixed state, hence its position in the qubit space is at the center, which is the origin.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is equivalent to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. This represents a maximally mixed state, which corresponds to a completely random quantum state. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states like \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) are located at the poles of the sphere, but a maximally mixed state like \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\) corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, as it represents equal probability for both states with no coherence.

Among the given options, the geometric position of the density matrix in the qubit space is:

- **A)** \(r = (1,1,0)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.
- **B)** \(r = (0,0,1)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **C)** \(r = (0,0,0)\): Correct, as this represents the origin in the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.
- **D)** \(r = (1,1,1)\): Incorrect, as this is unrelated to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix represents the maximally mixed state, which is located at the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
