Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, it's about stars' luminosities and how they compare based on some given factors. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius that's 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Wait, radial velocity—so that's the speed at which they're moving away or towards us. But how does that affect luminosity? Hmm, maybe it's about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength.

But the main question is about luminosity. They computed that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a certain factor. The options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, so a bit more than 2. So I guess I need to calculate the ratio of their luminosities.

Luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. Oh, right, because a star radiates energy from its surface area, which is 4πR², and the temperature's the fourth power from the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

So the key factors are R and T for each star. We know R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. So R1²/R2² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that's a factor of 2.25 just from the radius part.

But temperature is also important. The problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, is that right? Because if λ_max is same, then T1 = T2. Because λ_max = b / T. So if λ_max same, T same. So temperature ratio T1/T2 is 1.

So then, luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (1.5 R2 / R2 )² * (T1 / T2)^4 ) = (1.5)^2 * 1^4 = 2.25. So that would make L1 = 2.25 * L2. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. There's also something about radial velocities. Oh, right, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Does that affect the calculated luminosity? Because if a star is moving, its observed wavelength (like the peak) would be Doppler shifted.

Ah, right! Because when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength increases (redshift), and approaching would decrease it (blueshift). But in this problem, the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the Doppler shift must have been accounted for. So, the given wavelengths are the observed ones, so we have to relate the actual temperatures.

Wait, maybe I should think about this. Let's say star 2 is moving away at 700 km/s. Then the observed wavelength λ_obs for star 2 would be longer than its emitted wavelength λ_emit. So λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) ) )? Or wait, no. The Doppler shift formula is more accurately given by λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), assuming v is much less than c. Since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), we can approximate it as a linear shift.

Wait, but let me think. For a star moving away with velocity v, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), approximately. Similarly, for a star moving towards us, it's λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 - v/c). But since Star_1's radial velocity is zero, its observed wavelength is λ_emit1. For Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are same. So, the observed λ_max for both stars is same. But the emitted λ_max would be different, unless the temperatures are adjusted for their velocities.

So, for star 1: observed λ_max1 = emitted λ_max1, since v_r1=0.

Star 2: observed λ_max2 = emitted λ_max2 * (1 + v_r2/c). But since the observed λ_max is same for both, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So, λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T. So, λ_emit1 = b / T1, λ_emit2 = b / T2.

So, substituting, (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c). The b's cancel, so 1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) / T2 → T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, but wait. Wait, no: (b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c). Divide both sides by b: 1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) / T2 → T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

Hmm, but since Star 1's temperature is T1 and Star 2's temperature is T2, but now considering the Doppler effect, the actual T's (emitted) would be different. Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.

Let me write down the equations.

Star 1: observed λ_max1 = emitted λ_emit1.

Star 2: observed λ_max2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c) ≈ λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

And λ_max1 = λ_max2. So,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But λ_emit is given by Wien's law: λ_emit = b/T.

So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) / T2 → T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

But v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute that.

v = 700 km/s.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

v/c ≈ 700 / 3e5 → 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333...

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333), using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

But wait, if I'm precise, T1 = T2 / (1 + 700/(3e5)).

So, 700/(3e5) = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333333...

So 1 + 0.00233333 = 1.00233333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.00233333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.00233333) → approximately T2 multiplied by 0.997666667.

So, T1 ≈ 0.997666 * T2.

So, T1 is about 0.997666 times T2.

Wait, but how does this affect the luminosity?

Luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ (T2 * 0.997666)^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

So, L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (0.997666 T2)^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Simplify numerator:

( (1.5)^2 R2^2 ) * ( (0.997666)^4 T2^4 )

Denominator: R2² T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5²) * (0.997666)^4.

What's 1.5 squared? 2.25.

0.997666^4: Let's compute that.

0.997666 is approximately 0.997666.

Let me compute (0.997666)^4.

But wait, 1 - 0.002333 is 0.997666. So, (0.997666)^4 ≈ (1 - 0.002333)^4.

Using binomial approximation for (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x + 6x² - 4x³ + x⁴.

x = 0.002333.

Compute term by term:

1st term: 1.

2nd term: -4 * 0.002333 ≈ -0.009333.

3rd term: 6 * (0.002333)^2 = 6 * 0.00000544 ≈ 0.0000326.

4th term: -4 * (0.002333)^3 ≈ -4 * (0.0000000126) ≈ -0.00000005.

5th term: (0.002333)^4 ≈ 0.0000000003.

Adding all terms:

1 -0.009333 + 0.0000326 -0.00000005 + 0.0000000003 ≈ approximately 0.990669.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute 0.997666^4 numerically.

Let me compute step by step.

0.997666 squared:

0.997666 * 0.997666.

Let me compute 1 - 0.002334 is 0.997666.

(1 - a)² = 1 - 2a + a².

a = 0.002334.

So, (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.002334) + (0.002334)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004668 + 0.00000544 ≈ 0.99533644.

Then, square that to get to the fourth power.

(0.99533644)^2.

Again, approximate: (1 - 0.00466356)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00466356 + (0.00466356)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00932712 + 0.00002175 ≈ 0.99069463.

So, (0.997666)^4 ≈ 0.99069463.

So, putting it all together.

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99069463 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99069463.

Compute that: 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275. Then, 2.25 * 0.00069463 ≈ about 0.001561. So total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.001561 = 2.22906.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 2.25 * 0.99069463.

2.25 * 0.99069463.

Let me compute 2 * 0.99069463 = 1.98138926.

0.25 * 0.99069463 = approximately 0.24767366.

Add them: 1.98138926 + 0.24767366 = 2.22906292.

So, approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Wait, 2.229 is about 2.23, so option D is ~2.23.

But wait, earlier I thought the Doppler shift would make the temperatures a bit lower for Star_1, but now the luminosity ratio comes out to about 2.23.

But wait, let me think again. Are the temperatures the same in the emitted spectrum, or do we have to account for the Doppler shift in the observed wavelengths?

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (i.e., the observed λ_max) are the same. So, considering the Doppler shift, the actual emitted wavelengths would be different, but the observed ones are same.

So, for Star_1, λ_max1_emit = observed λ_max.

For Star_2, λ_max2_emit = observed λ_max / (1 + v_r2/c). Because, when a source is moving away, the observed λ is longer. So, λ_emit2 = λ_observed / (1 + v_r2/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_emit is proportional to 1/T.

So, λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

So, T1 < T2.

So, when we compute L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We have R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25.

T1/T2 = [T2/(1+v/c)] / T2 = 1/(1 + v/c).

So, (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c)]^4.

v is 700 km/s; v/c is 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333.

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333.

So, [1/1.002333]^4 ≈ (0.997666)^4 ≈ 0.99069 as calculated before.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 2.25, but that was before considering the Doppler shift. So, the correct answer after considering the Doppler shift is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Doppler effect. Let me double-check.

Wait, when a star is moving away, the observed λ is longer. So, observed λ = emitted λ * (1 + v/c).

So, for Star_2, which is moving away, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But λ_obs1 = λ_emit1, because Star_1 is not moving.

But the problem says λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c).

Divide both sides by b: 1/T1 = (1 + v_r2/c) * (1/T2).

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c).

Which is what I had before. So, that's correct.

So, T1 is less than T2. So, when computing the luminosity ratio, it's (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Which is 2.25 multiplied by [1/(1 + v_r2/c)]^4.

As calculated, [1/(1.002333)]^4 ≈ 0.99069.

So, 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.229, which rounds to 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius Ratio**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \).
2. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of \( v_{r1} = 0 \), and Star_2 has \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).
3. **Observed Wavelengths**: The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \)).

### Step 1: Temperature Ratio
The observed wavelength at which a star appears brightest is related to its temperature via Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, since \( v_{r1} = 0 \), the observed wavelength equals the emitted wavelength: \( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{emit},1} \).

For Star_2, the observed wavelength is Doppler shifted:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs},2} = \lambda_{\text{emit},2} \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{v_{r2}}{c} \right)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \), we equate the emitted wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit},1} = \lambda_{\text{emit},2} \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{v_{r2}}{c} \right)
\]

Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto \frac{1}{T} \), we find:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_{r2}}{c}}
\]

Substituting \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \):

\[
\frac{v_{r2}}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \approx 0.997667
\]

Thus, \( T_1 \approx 0.997667 T_2 \).

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \) and \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.997667 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( 1.5 \right)^2 \cdot \left( 0.997667 \right)^4
\]

1. Compute \( \left( 1.5 \right)^2 \):
   \[
   \left( 1.5 \right)^2 = 2.25
   \]

2. Compute \( \left( 0.997667 \right)^4 \):
   Using the approximation \( \left( 1 - x \right)^4 \approx 1 - 4x \) for small \( x \), where \( x = 0.002333 \):
   \[
   \left( 0.997667 \right)^4 \approx 1 - 4 \cdot 0.002333 \approx 1 - 0.009332 = 0.990668
   \]

3. Multiply the results:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.990668 \approx 2.229
   \]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Comparing this to the options:

- **A)** ~2.25
- **B)** ~2.32
- **C)** ~2.35
- **D)** ~2.23

The closest match is **D) ~2.23**.

**Answer: D**
