Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, okay. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. That probably means that the molar ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1. So, the complex is CaEDTA²−, right? Or maybe it's CaEDTA with a different charge, but the key is that each calcium ion binds one EDTA molecule.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, I think the overall concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, what's the dissociation of this complex? Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and the complex formation is typically represented as:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA²− 

And the formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

In this case, K_Ca-EDTA is 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is very stable. That means that the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low.

But wait, how much EDTA is present? Let me think. If the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, that means initially, the concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates very little (because Kf is large), the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4- will be very small.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the initial conditions. Let's assume that the solution only contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So, when it dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would each be x, and their product would be (x)(x) = x².

So, the formation constant equation would be Kf = [CaEDTA^2−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) → 5e10 = 0.02 / (x²).

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me clarify: the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's say the complex dissociates a little, releasing x moles of Ca²+ and x moles of EDTA^4-. So, the concentrations would be:

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x

But since Kf is very large (5e10), the dissociation x must be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, Kf ≈ 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / (5e10)

Calculating x²: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me calculate that. Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 10^-13 is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5.

Wait, 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. So 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting x = 2e-6
