Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different compounds, so I need to figure out which one fits the spectral data.

First, let's look at the IR data. The medium to strong bands are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad peaks, which probably indicate either N-H stretching (from amides or amines) or O-H stretching (like in carboxylic acids or their derivatives). But wait, the compound's formula doesn't have an -OH group because it's O2. Hmm, wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count: 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 2 oxygens. So possible functional groups could be esters, amides, formamides, maybe something else.

The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). Ester carbonyls are usually around 1720-1740, amides a bit lower, around 1650-1680. So 1720 suggests an ester or maybe a formamide? Wait, formamide usually has a higher wavenumber, around 1680-1700 I think. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but the formula doesn't have a ketone. So ester seems more likely.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, probably a methyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ethoxy group. So maybe an ethyl ester or something similar.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating to 2H. Could be an NCH2 group, maybe from an amide. Or perhaps a CH2 next to an oxygen, but the broadness suggests it's exchanging or maybe a CH2 connected to something else. Alternatively, a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2, but why broad? Or maybe an amide's NH2, but that would be a different region. Wait, no, amide protons are usually broad, but in this case, the integration is 2H, so maybe it's a CH2 connected to something else. Not sure yet.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests splitting into four, which usually comes from two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 connected to another CH2. Like OCH2CH2O, but wait, quartet in this region. Another possibility is a carbonyl adjacent group. For example, in an ester, the CH2 next to the oxygen could be around 4.5 as a quartet, but wait, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 is usually a quartet around 4.1 ppm, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a methylene adjacent to an oxygen and another CH2, so perhaps an ethyl group attached to an O linked to another group, like OCH2CH2CO... Wait.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Each doublet has two protons, so the ring has two substituents in para positions. The downfield shift at 8.0 suggests the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro, carbonyl, etc. So maybe one substituent is an -OEt (ethoxy) and the other is a carbonyl group, like a formyl or an amide.

Now, let's look at the options and see which fit.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy in the meta position relative to the amide. Wait, but benzamide is PhCONH2. So the substituents would be OEt and CONH2. If they are in meta positions, the H NMR would show different splitting. But in the given NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests a para-substitution. So maybe this isn't A.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is Ph-OEt with formamide (HCONH- attached). So the substituents would be OEt and HCO-NH- on the benzene ring, para to each other. That would fit the para substitution. The formamide would contribute a carbonyl (so 1720 cm-1 in IR? Wait, formamide's carbonyl is usually around 1680-1700. So 1720 is higher than expected. The given IR has a strong band at 1720, which would fit more with an ester or maybe a ketone, but formamide might not hit 1720. So maybe this is not it.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be Ph-NH2 with a propionoate group (CH2CH2COO-). Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NHPh. Alternatively, the propionate could be attached to the benzene in the para position. So the substituents are NH2 and COOEt perhaps? Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2, so let's count. Benzene (6 C) plus propionate (3 C) plus amine (NH2). So for the substituents: propionate (O2) and amine (N). So the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. So the structure is O=C(O-)CH2CH2-O- attached to the benzene with an NH2 group. Wait, how?

Alternatively, it's the propionate group as an ester, but the formula would have that. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2, but that's unlikely because NH2 protons are usually broad but in a different region. Or perhaps the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, propionate would have a CH2CH2COO- group. So maybe the NMR shows the OCH2CH2COO group. Let me see.

In the NMR, 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) would be the CH2CH3 group. Then, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. The 4.0 ppm (2H, bs) could be another CH2, maybe the one next to the O. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester with NH2 in the para position. So the ester group would be OEt, and the amine is NH2. So the substituents on the benzene are OEt and NH2, but wait, wait. Wait, benzoate ester would be OEt attached to the carbonyl. So the substituents would be OEt and NH2 in the para positions. Let me check the NMR.

In this case, the ester group would have an OCH2CH3. The OCH2CH3 would typically show up around 4.1 ppm as a quartet, but in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group is attached to something else.

Wait, let me think about the NMR for each option.

Starting with Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is: O

Benzoate ester: PhCOOEt. But with an NH2 in the para position. Wait, no, the structure would be PhCOOEt with NH2 in para, but wait, that would be 4-aminobenzoic acid, but as an ester, it's PhCOOEt with NH2 in the para. Wait, no, wait. Benzoate is PhCOO-, so if it's esterified, it would be PhCOOEt. So the substituents are COOEt and NH2 on the ring in para positions.

So the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR given (7.0 and 8.0 ppm). The downfield shift at 8.0 is because of the electron-withdrawing groups (COOEt and NH2). Wait, but NH2 is electron donating, so maybe that's not the case. Hmm, perhaps the downfield shift is due to the COOEt group.

In the NMR, the COOEt group would have the OCH2CH3 as a quartet around 4.1-4.3. But in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, so that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl ester is split differently. Let me think about the splitting.

Wait, the ethyl group in the ester usually has the OCH2CH3 as a quartet integrating to 2H, and the CH2CH3 as a triplet at ~1.2 ppm. That matches the 1.20 (t, 3H) in the NMR. So for D, the OCH2 would be at ~4.1-4.2, but here it's at 4.5, so that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe that's a problem.

Looking at Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: HCONH-Ph-OEt (para). So the substituents are OEt and HCONH2 on the benzene ring. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which fits. The formamide has a carbonyl (HCONH-). The IR would show a strong band around 1720? Wait, formamide's carbonyl is usually around 1680-1690, which is lower than 1720, so the IR might not fit. The strong band here is at 1720, which suggests an ester. So maybe B isn't correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure is CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph. The propionate is a three-carbon chain attached to the benzene via the NH group. So the substituents are NH2 and COOEt on the benzene? Wait, no, wait. If it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the NH of the benzene. So the benzene has NH2 and CH2CH2COO- as substituents in para positions. The NMR would show the CH2CH2COO group.

The 1H NMR would have:

- The ethyl group from propionate: the CH2CH2COO would have a triplet for the -CH2CH3, which is at 1.20 (t, 3H) as given. Then the CH2 next to the COO would be a quartet at around 4.5 ppm (which matches the data), and the CH2 connected to the oxygen would be a triplet at around 3.5-4.0, but in the data, there's a quartet at 4.5 and a broad singlet at 4.0. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps for propionate, the structure is O=C-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but attached to the benzene as O=C-O-CH2CH2-CH2-NHPh? No, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is part of an ester. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count: phenyl (C6H5), then the substituent would be something with 3 carbons, 1 N, 2 O.

Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be a different formula. Alternatively, maybe the propionate is attached as a substituent in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is O=C-O-CH2CH2-CH3, attached to the benzene. Wait, but the formula would be Ph-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, but that's an ester. But the formula is C9H11NO2. Ph is C6H5, ester would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3, which is 3 carbons. So total would be 6 + 3 + O2. Wait, the formula for that would be C9H10O3, which doesn't match. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So it's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, 1 N, 2 O. Let's consider each option:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure is benzamide (PhCONH2) with an ethoxy in the meta position. The formula would be C9H10NO2, because Ph is C6H5, CONH2 is 1 carbonyl, 2 H from NH2, and OEt is O and 2 C. Wait, let's count: benzamide is C7H7NO2 (Ph is C6H5, CONH2 is 2 O and 2 C: O2 comes from the amide. So adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would make it C7+2 (from OEt) = C9, H: 5 (Ph) + 2 (CONH2) + 6 (OEt CH2CH3) but wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, 3-ethoxybenzamide would have the formula C9H10NO3? Wait, OEt is O, so benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding OEt (C2H5O) would make C9H12O3N? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look at the options and their molecular formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide with OEt in meta. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding OEt (which is C2H5O) would make C9H12O3N? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2, so molecular formula is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would replace a hydrogen on the benzene. So the formula would be C7 + C2 (from OEt) = C9, H: 7 (from benzamide) -1 (replaced by OEt) +5 (from OEt) = 11 H. O: 2 (from benzamide) +1 (OEt) =3 O. N:1. So the formula would be C9H11NO3. But the question's formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't fit. So A isn't possible.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the formula would be:

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2 (Ph is C6H5, OEt is C2H5O). Then formamide adds HCONH–, which is 2 O, 1 N. So total C: 6+2=8; +1 from HCONH would be 9 C. H: 5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) + HCONH (has 1 H, but connected to the benzene, so maybe 5+5=10 + from formamide? Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

Ph group is C6H5. Then OEt is C2H5O, so the substituent is OEt and HCONH–. So the molecule is:

Ph-OEt and Ph-HCONH2? Wait, no. Wait, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide is HCONH–Ph-OEt. So the structure is O

HCONH– attached to the benzene which has an OEt group. So the formula would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 + HCONH– group. So for the benzene ring, it's C6H4 (since two substituents: OEt and HCONH2). The substituents are OEt (C2H5O) and HCONH2 (which is C2H3NO2). So overall:

C6 + C2 (OEt) + C1 (formamide's carbonyl) = C9. H: let's see, the benzene has 4 H (since two substituents in para). OEt contributes 5 H (CH2CH3), formamide has NH2 (2 H, but as amide, maybe not all present). Wait, this is getting messy. Alternatively, let's count the molecular formula.

Each substituent: OEt is -OCH2CH3 (which is C2H5O). Formamide is HCONH–, which is C1H1NO. So the entire molecule would be:

Ph (C6H5) → but with two substituents (OEt and HCONH2). So:

Ph is C6H5 → when two substituents are added (OEt and HCONH2), the formula becomes C6H5 → but each substitution replaces an H.

So substituting OEt (C2H5O) and HCONH2 (C2H3NO2) into the benzene:

Wait, actually, each substitution replaces an H, so the benzene becomes C6H3.

So the molecule is C6H3(OCH2CH3)(HCONH2). Let's count:

C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (OEt) + 2 (HCONH2: C=O and NH2) → Wait, HCONH2 has 2 C? No, HCONH2 is H-C(=O)-NH2. So that's 2 C: one from the carbonyl C and one from the H attached. Wait, no, HCONH2 has one C (the carbonyl C), with H attached. So substituent HCONH2 adds 1 C, and OEt adds 2 C. So total C:6 +2+1=9. That matches.

H: Benzene ring has 3 H (since two substituents in para). OEt contributes 5 H (CH2CH3). HCONH2 contributes 2 H (NH2). So total H: 3 +5 +2 =10. But the formula is C9H11NO2. So that's not matching. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, HCONH2 is H-C(=O)-NH2. So the substituent is HCONH2, which contributes 3 H (the H attached to C, and two from NH2). So the benzene ring would have 3 H (since two substituents). So H count:

OEt (5 H) + HCONH2 (3 H) + benzene (3 H) =11 H. So total H is 11. That matches the formula. O: OEt has 1 O, HCONH2 has 2 O. So total O is 3. But the formula is O2. So this isn't matching. So B is not correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure is benzene ring with NH2 and propionoate group. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the molecule would be Ph-NH-COO-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the propionate could be attached as O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, perhaps it's Ph-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 with an NH2 group. Let me think about the formula.

Ph is C6H5. Propionate ester would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (that's 3 carbons, adding to the 6 in benzene). So C6 +3 =9 C. O: from the ester, it's 3 O (two from COO, one from O in propionate). Then, the NH2 adds 1 N. So the molecular formula would be C9H10O3N, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So doesn't match.

Alternatively, if it's an amide, it would have different O count. Hmm, not sure.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester (PhCOOEt) with NH2 in the para position. So the substituents are COOEt and NH2 on the benzene.

PhCOOEt would have the formula C9H10O2: Ph is C6H5, COOEt is C3H5O2. So C6 +3=9 C, H: 5 (Ph) +5 (COOEt: 2 from COO and 3 from Et) → wait, PhCOOEt is C6H5COOCH2CH3, which is C9H10O2. Adding an NH2 group in the para position would replace a H on the benzene. So the formula becomes C9H9O2N. But the given formula is C9H11NO2, which has two more H than that. So D's formula would be C9H10O2N? Or am I miscalculating.

Wait, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be PhCOOEt with NH2 in para. So the structure is:

Ph (with NH2 at position 4 and COOEt at position 1). So the formula would be:

Ph: C6H5
COOEt: C3H5O2
NH2: adds N and replaces a H.

So total C: 6 +3=9
H: Ph has 5, COOEt has 5 (CH2CH3?), NH2 replaces a H. So H count: 5 (Ph) -1 (replaced) +5 (COOEt) = 9 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's 9 H, but the given has 11. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps I didn't account for all the hydrogens correctly. Let me recalculate:

PhCOOEt is C6H5COOCH2CH3. That's 6 carbons in benzene, 2 in COO, 2 in ethyl → 10 carbons? No, wait, Ph is 6, COO is 2 (from -COO-), and Et is 2 → total 6+2+2=10? No, wait, the formula of PhCOOEt is C9H10O2.

Wait, correct formula for benzoic acid is C7H6O2. As an ethyl ester, it's C7H6O2 + C2H5 → but that would be C9H10O2. So the molecular formula is C9H10O2.

Adding NH2 in para would replace one H on the benzene. So the formula becomes C9H9O2N. But the given compound is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't fit. So D's formula doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the substituent isn't NH2 but something else. Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong structure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR data. The NMR has 1.20 ppm triplet (3H), which is likely the CH2CH3 from an ethyl group. Then, 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) would be OCH2, perhaps from an ester (OCH2CO). The 4.0 ppm bs (2H) could be a NHCH2 group, but that's a stretch.

Looking at the aromatic region: two doublets, each 2H, suggests para substitution. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) is likely due to an electron-withdrawing group, like an ester or amide.

Looking back at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong band, which I thought was an ester. So the compound likely has an ester group.

Now, looking at the options, which have an ester?

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That has an ester group (COOEt), which would give a strong peak around 1720. The amine group would have N-H stretches, which would appear in IR as broad peaks. The given IR has bands around 3420 and 3325, which could be N-H stretches. So that fits.

Now, let's think about the NMR.

PhCOOEt (without the NH2) would have:

- The ethyl group as triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H) and quartet at 4.1 ppm (2H).

But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, that's higher than usual. So maybe the ester's OCH2 is at 4.5.

Wait, maybe the substituent is causing the shift. If the benzene ring is para-substituted with an NH2, the OCH2 could be deshielded, appearing at a higher ppm. So the quartet at 4.5 could be the OCH2 group.

Then the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 group. Wait, but NH2 protons are typically broad, but in the aromatic region. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in a different part of the structure.

Wait, in D, the structure has an ester (COOEt) and an NH2 in para. The NMR would show:

- 1.20 (t, 3H) for the ethyl group.
- 4.5 (q, 2H) for the OCH2 of the ester.
- 4.0 (bs, 2H) could be the NH2, but usually NH protons are broad but in a different region, maybe around 1-5 ppm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group attached to an amine. Wait, but in D's structure, the amine is directly attached to the ring, so there's no CH2 attached to it.

Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Looking at the NMR again:

1.20 ppm: triplet, 3H → ethyl CH2CH3.

4.5 ppm: quartet, 2H → OCH2CO.

4.0 ppm: broad singlet, 2H → maybe a NH2 group. But I'm not sure why it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen and another group, but that doesn't fit D.

Wait, in D, the structure is PhCOOEt with NH2 in para. The NMR would have the ethyl group as triplet and quartet, which matches. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which matches. The IR has N-H stretches, which would be from the NH2 group. The 1720 cm-1 is the ester carbonyl. So that fits.

But then, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) in NMR: what is that? If it's an amine, perhaps it's the NH2 protons, but they usually appear as broad peaks in the range of 1-5 ppm, but integration 2H. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to an O, but in D's structure, there's no such group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the NH2, but the splitting is a singlet because it's exchanging and the two H are equivalent. Wait, but in para substitution, the NH2 would have two equivalent H, but in reality, NH2 protons are usually broad and might not split into a quartet or anything, but appear as a broad peak integrating to 2H.

So perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2 group. But in that case, why is it a singlet? Because the NH2 is on the benzene ring and not split by any neighboring protons.

Wait, but in the NMR data, it's a broad singlet. So that fits an NH2 group. So the NMR would have:

- Ethyl group triplet at 1.20.
- OCH2 quartet at 4.5.
- NH2 broad singlet at 4.0.
- Aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0.

So all the data would fit Option D.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the molecular formula, I thought D's formula is C9H10O2N, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, maybe my calculation was wrong.

Let me recalculate the molecular formula for Option D.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is C6H4(NH2)(COOEt). The formula would be:

C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (Et) = 10? No, wait, the benzene is C6, COOEt is C3 (COO has 2 C, Et has 2 C → but wait, COOEt is O=C-O-OCH2CH3? No, ester is O=C-O-R, so COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3, which is 3 C (the C from COO, and the two from Et). So C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) +1 (the NH2 doesn't add C) → total C9.

H: Benzene has 4 H (since two substituents in para). COOEt has 5 H (CH2CH3). NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 4 +5 +2 =11. O: benzene has O from COOEt (2 O) and the NH2 doesn't add O. So O2. N: 1.

So the formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula. So earlier calculation was wrong. So D fits.

So the IR shows N-H stretches (broad) and ester carbonyl. The NMR shows ethyl triplet, OCH2 quartet, NH2 as a broad singlet, and aromatic doublets.

So the correct answer should be D.


The compound to be identified has the molecular formula **C9H11NO2**, and the spectral data provided includes IR and 1H NMR. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### IR Analysis:
- **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These broad peaks suggest the presence of N-H stretching, likely from an amine or amide group.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This indicates a carbonyl group, likely from an ester, as esters typically absorb in this range.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a methyl group adjacent to an oxygen atom, likely part of an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, which could correspond to an NH2 group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, likely from a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen atom, such as the OCH2 group in an ester.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets each integrating to 2H, indicative of a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Option Analysis:
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (PhCONH2) with an ethoxy group in the meta position.
- The aromatic region would show more complex splitting due to meta substitution, not the observed para substitution. Additionally, the IR and NMR data do not fully align with this structure. **Eliminated.**

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH–) attached to a benzene ring with an ethoxy group in the para position.
- The aromatic region matches the para substitution, but the IR data does not align with the expected carbonyl absorption for a formamide (~1680–1700 cm⁻¹), which is lower than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. **Eliminated.**

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: A benzene ring with an NH2 group and a propionate group in the para position.
- The molecular formula does not match the given formula (C9H11NO2). Additionally, the NMR data does not support the presence of a propionate group. **Eliminated.**

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: A benzene ring with an NH2 group and an ethyl ester group (COOEt) in the para position.
- The aromatic region matches the para substitution. The IR data aligns with the ester carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹) and N-H stretches (3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹). The NMR data also fits:
  - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: Ethyl CH2CH3 group.
