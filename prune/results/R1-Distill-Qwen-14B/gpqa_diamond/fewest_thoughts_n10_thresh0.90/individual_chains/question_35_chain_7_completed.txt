Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which equals c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So I think I'll need to write down what this matrix looks like.

Wait, c is h/(4π), so when I construct Ay, it'll be (h/(4π)) * S. Let me write S first:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So multiplying each element by c, Ay becomes:

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
      [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

I think that's correct. Now, the question is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh right, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. So I need to solve Ay * φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

But wait, since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it's manageable. Let me denote the eigenvector φ as [φ1, φ2]^T. Then the equation becomes:

Ay * [φ1; φ2] = a [φ1; φ2]

So each component gives an equation:

For the first row: (-i h/(4π)) φ2 = a φ1
Second row: (i h/(4π)) φ1 = a φ2

Hmm, so I can write these as:

(-i c) φ2 = a φ1  --> (1)
(i c) φ1 = a φ2  --> (2)

Where c is h/(4π). Let me substitute equation (1) into equation (2). From (1), φ2 = (a φ1)/( -i c )

Substitute into (2):

i c φ1 = a * (a φ1)/( -i c )

Let me rearrange this. Multiply both sides by (-i c):

i c * (-i c) φ1 = a^2 φ1.

Wait, let's compute the left side. i * (-i) is (i * -i) which is 1, because i*(-i)= -i² = -(-1)=1. And c is h/(4π). So the left side is (1) * c² φ1.

Wait no, because it's (i c) * (-i c) )= (i * (-i)) (c * c) )= (1) c².

So equation becomes: c² φ1 = a² φ1.

Assuming φ1 is not zero (since it's an eigenvector), we can divide both sides by φ1:

c² = a² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues a are +c and -c. What's c again? Oh, c = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but let me check that again. Because when I substituted, I might have made a mistake. Let me redo the substitution.

From equation (1): φ2 = (a φ1)/( -i c )

Substituting into equation (2):

i c φ1 = a * [ (a φ1) / ( -i c ) ]

So left side: i c φ1

Right side: a² φ1 / ( -i c )

So equation becomes: i c = a² / ( -i c )

Multiply both sides by (-i c):

i c * (-i c) = a².

Compute the left side: i * (-i) is 1, so it's c² = a².

So yes, a = ±c. So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

But wait, looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2π h and real parts ±h/4π. That doesn't seem right because our eigenvalues are real? Wait, wait, no. Wait a minute, is that correct?

Wait, hold on. Wait, h is Planck's constant. But wait, in quantum mechanics, angular momentum has eigenvalues in units of ħ, which is h/(2π). Oh wait, so perhaps I got the matrix S wrong? Let me think.

Wait, I've probably confused S here. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices. Oh, because the S matrix given looks like the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

Ah, right! The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, right? But wait, in the question, S is given, and Ay = c * S. So perhaps c is such that Ay is proportional to the Pauli matrix.

But the eigenvalues of S (the Pauli Y matrix) are ±i? Or wait, no. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian? Wait, no, wait. The Pauli Y matrix is Hermitian because it's equal to its conjugate transpose.

Wait, let me compute the eigenvalues of S. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So to find its eigenvalues, find the determinant of (S - λ I).

Determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (i * i) → λ² - (-1) = λ² +1 =0 → λ² = -1 → λ = ±i. Oh, right, so the eigenvalues of S are i and -i.

Wait, but in our case, Ay = c * S, so the eigenvalues would be c * i and c * (-i) → a = ±i c.

Wait, but wait! I thought earlier that a was ±c, but that's only if I had the equations correct. Let me re-express this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. So let's recast the problem. The matrix Ay is c * S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So the matrix Ay is:

Ay = c * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which is:

[ [0, -i c],
  [i c, 0] ]

So the eigenvalues of this matrix are the same as the eigenvalues of S scaled by c. Since S has eigenvalues ±i, then Ay has eigenvalues ±i c.

Wait, but c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±i h/(4π). But I thought that when we considered Ay acting on φ, we got a real eigenvalue? I must have messed up earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check my approach. Because I started by solving the eigenvalue equation and thought the eigenvalues are real, but that's not the case. Wait, no, in the previous approach I might have made a mistake.

Wait, I had the equations:

(-i c) φ2 = a φ1 → equation (1)

(i c) φ1 = a φ2 → equation (2)

Let me rearrange equation (1):

φ2 = a φ1 / ( -i c )

Plug into equation (2):

i c φ1 = a (a φ1)/( -i c )

Multiply both sides by (-i c):

i c * (-i c) φ1 = a² φ1.

Compute left side: i * (-i) = 1, so it's c² φ1.

So equation is c² φ1 = a² φ1 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are ±c, which would be ± h/(4π). But this contradicts the previous result. Hmm, what's going on here?

Wait, but S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±i. So if Ay is c*S, then its eigenvalues should be c * i and c * (-i), which are purely imaginary.

But according to the equations I solved, the eigenvalues are real, ±c. So which one is correct?

I think I might have made a mistake in the setup. Wait, in the problem statement, the operator is Ay = c · S. Now, S is the Pauli Y matrix. But if we're looking for eigenvalues, perhaps I should compute the characteristic equation.

The matrix Ay is 2x2:

[0, -i c ]

[i c, 0 ]

The characteristic equation is det(Ay - a I ) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[-a, -i c ]

[i c, -a ]

The determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - (-i c)(i c ) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (i²) c² * (-1) → wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = (1) c².

So determinant: a² - (1 * c²) = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

Wait, so that would imply that the eigenvalues are real, ±c. But this contradicts the earlier thought that the eigenvalues of S are ±i.

Wait, but perhaps S is not Hermitian? Let me check. The Pauli Y matrix is Hermitian because S† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S. Therefore, it should have real eigenvalues because Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues. Wait, but earlier I found that the eigenvalues of S are ±i, which are imaginary. That's a contradiction.

Wait, no, I must have made a mistake in calculating the eigenvalues of S. Let me compute the eigenvalues correctly.

The Pauli Y matrix is:

σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

To find its eigenvalues, compute the determinant of (σy - λ I) = 0.

Matrix is:

[-λ, -i]

[i, -λ]

Determinant: (λ)(λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

Compute (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant equation: λ² - (1) =0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. That makes more sense because σy is Hermitian. So earlier calculation was wrong.

Wait, wait, that's conflicting. Let me recheck. The Pauli Y matrix is:

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

So determinant of (σy - λ I) is:

(0-λ)(0-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

(-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is λ² - 1 =0 → λ=±1.

Ah, okay, so S has eigenvalues ±1. So when we have Ay = c * S, the eigenvalues a are c * 1 and c * (-1) → a = c and a = -c.

So eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π).

But wait, looking back at the options, none of them directly state this. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That's not correct because our eigenvalues are purely real.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Doesn't fit.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Wait, but let's think about the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π).

Now, looking at the options, none of them directly match. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Because sometimes, angular momentum operators have eigenvalues in units of ħ, which is h/(2π). Let me think. Oh, wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices for spin-½ particles are S_x = ħ σ_x / 2, S_y = ħ σ_y / 2, etc. But in this problem, the operator A_y is given as c·S, with c = h/(4π). Let me check: (h/(4π)) * S. So if S is the Pauli matrix, then A_y is (h/(4π)) * σ_y. So the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * λ, where λ is the eigenvalue of σ_y, which we found to be ±1.

So a = (h/(4π)) * (±1) → ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are real and equal to ± h/(4π). So looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2π h or –2π h, which is not correct. Option B says imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. No, so options A and B don't fit. So the correct eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π). Looking at the options, I don't see an option that matches this directly. Hmm. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Hmm, what's A²? A² is the operator squared. For angular momentum, the square operator has eigenvalues a², which is the same for any direction. So if a particle is in an eigenstate of A_y, then it's also in an eigenstate of A² because [A², A_y] = 0.

So eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A² as well. So option C is correct in that part. But what about Az, the Z-component? The operators A_y and A_z don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So a state which is an eigenfunction of A_y is not an eigenfunction of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the basis functions are the eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions form a basis. But for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors are the basis vectors for the space. So option D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So if both C and D are correct, I need to see which one is correct in the options.

Wait, let's look again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I thought earlier, this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Hmm. Well, any eigenfunctions would form a basis, but I'm not sure if the statement is exactly correct. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors are a basis, but only if they are not degenerate. In this case, the eigenvalues are non-degenerate, so yes, the eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis. So D might be correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's think about each option.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A squared, but not of Az. True, because A² commutes with Ay, but Az does not.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for R². So yes, D is correct.

So the question is which of these statements is correct.

Looking back, the question says, "During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct?"

So let's reevaluate the options.

Option C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So which options are correct? Let me look again at the options.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. So I need to pick the correct statement.

But the question is about the process during the calculation. So which statement would be correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the operator A is the component of the angular momentum. So the intrinsic angular momentum for a muon (which is a lepton, spin-1/2) would have S being the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but in the problem, the operator Ay is given as c * S, where c = h/(4π). So perhaps c is ħ/(2π), since ħ = h/(2π). Wait, no: ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2.

Wait, so c = h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) / 2 = ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) * (±1) = ± ħ/2.

But ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π), which matches our earlier result. So eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

So looking back at the options, none of the options A or B match, as they have imaginary parts, which isn't the case here.

Thus, looking at options C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Yes, because A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator, and for spin-½ particles, A² is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * ( σ_x^2 + σ_y^2 + σ_z^2 ) = ( (ħ/2)^2 ) (3I), since the Pauli matrices satisfy σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z² = 3I. So any eigenstate of Ay will have a definite A².

On the other hand, Az doesn't commute with Ay, so if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it won't be an eigenstate of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the options are exclusive; only one is correct.

Hmm. So looking at the options again, perhaps option D is correct because when you diagonalize a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form the basis. So when you work with the operator, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis for the space on which Ay acts. So yes, D is correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is option D.

Alternatively, option C is also correct. But perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think.

Looking back, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), which are real. So the eigenvalues are real, so the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Because it's a quantum operator, which should be Hermitian to have real eigenvalues.

Wait, let me check if Ay is Hermitian.

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The conjugate transpose of Ay would be:

( h/(4π) ) * [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is (h/(4π)) * [[0, i], [-i, 0]] = (h/(4π)) * [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

But the original matrix is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

Which is the same as (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Wait, what's the conjugate transpose of Ay?

Each element (i,j) becomes (j,i)*.

So element (1,2) is (-i c), so its conjugate is (i c). The transposed position is (2,1), so Ay† would have (2,1) as i c. So Ay† is:

[[0, i c],
 [-i c, 0]]

Which is the same as Ay if c is real, which it is. So Ay is equal to its conjugate transpose, hence Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues are real, which matches our earlier conclusion.

So eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are incorrect.

Now, options C and D are left. Both seem correct, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Well, because A² commutes with Ay, [A², Ay] = 0, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But Az doesn't commute, so no.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors (eigenfunctions in this 2D space) form a basis. So D is correct.

So the statements in options C and D are both correct. But the options are separate; only one can be correct.

Wait, but the problem is a multiple-choice question where only one option is correct.

Wait, let's read the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. That's also correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is option D because during the calculation, you would diagonalize the matrix, which uses the eigenvectors as the basis. So during the calculation, you're considering the eigenfunctions as the basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because it's a statement about the properties of the eigenfunctions.

Hmm. But perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another angle: The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, which statement holds.

So during the calculation, when we find eigenvectors, they form the basis for the space. So option D is a correct statement.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps all statements should be evaluated.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², which is correct, because A² commutes with Ay.

But wait, the muon's angular momentum is spin-½. So A² would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2 * 3 (since for spin ½, S² = (½)(½+1)ħ² = 3/4 ħ². So if A is the component, then A² would have eigenvalues ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * (3) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, A is the component, so A² would be (Ay)^2.

Wait, no, A² is the square of the magnitude of the angular momentum vector. Which is A_x² + A_y² + A_z². But in any case, for a spin-½ particle, A² (the square of the total angular momentum) has eigenvalues (½)(½+1)ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

But when you have a state that's an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A² because A² commutes with Ay. So option C is correct.

So between options C and D, which is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the 2x2 matrix. So when you diagonalize Ay, you use the eigenvectors as the basis.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So if during the calculation, you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the eigenvectors are the basis of the matrix, then option D is correct.

Alternatively, the statement in option C is a correct statement that would hold during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but another way: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. But the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for R². So yes, option D is correct.

But I'm going to have to make a choice. Let's see what the options are.

Looking at the options again, the correct statement is option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, but I'm not completely confident. Alternatively, option C might be the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back, the eigenfunctions of Ay would indeed also be eigenfunctions of A², so option C is correct, but option D seems also correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: The operator Ay has eigenvalues ± h/(4π). So the question is about the statements during the calculation. So in the process, when finding eigenvalues, you find they're real, so options with imaginary parts are wrong. So options A and B are out.

Now, the other options, C and D, which are correct.

But in the question, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Well, when you diagonalize the matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis. So that's correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², which is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But the options are likely to have only one correct choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But perhaps I should think about the initial problem. The operator is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions are two-dimensional vectors, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

Alternatively, option C is correct because it's a correct statement about the eigenfunctions.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, the problem says the first row of S is [0, -i], second row [i, 0]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay = (h/(4π)) S.

So the eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)).

So which of the options match this? None except perhaps if I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalue calculation. Let me try another approach. Suppose I compute the eigenvalues of Ay directly.

The matrix Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c=h/(4π).

The characteristic equation is ( (0 - a)^2 ) - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = 0.

So (a^2) - ( (-i)(i) c^2 ) = 0.

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So equation: a^2 - c^2 =0 → a= ±c.

So eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real. So options A and B are out.

So now, looking at the options, options C and D are left.

So in the calculation, which statements are correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Yes, correct. Because A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, so it commutes with Ay.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Yes, correct. Because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both options C and D are correct statements, but perhaps only one is an option.

But looking at the options, perhaps D is correct.

Wait, the question says during the calculation, which statement would you consider correct.

So if during the calculation, you consider the basis of the matrix, which is 2x2, you would use the eigenvectors as the basis. So D is correct.

Alternatively, during the calculation, you would know that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² as well, so C is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. But perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But another thought: the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as the eigenfunctions of S_y (since Ay is proportional to S_y), and these are states with definite S_y, which would have definite A^2 (since A^2 is S^2 times a constant).

So the correct statements are C and D.

Wait, but the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps only one is correct.

Looking back, the question says during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So in the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you would find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So during the calculation, you would note that, hence option D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. So I'll settle on that.


The problem involves determining which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the operator \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\
   i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \):
   \[
   \det 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   -a & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\
   i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -a
   \end{bmatrix}
   = (-a)^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = a^2 - \left(-i^2 \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}\right).
   \]
   Since \( -i^2 = 1 \), the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   a^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0 \implies a^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real.

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), with no imaginary components.
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), but not of \( A_z \) (the \( Z \)-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \) commute (\( [A_y, A^2] = 0 \)), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute (\( [A_y, A_z] \neq 0 \)), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix form a basis for the \( 2 \)-dimensional vector space on which \( A_y \) acts.

4. **Final Decision:**
   Both options **C** and **D** are correct statements. However, the question specifies selecting the correct statement during the calculation. Since the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) forming a basis is a fundamental property directly relevant to the calculation, **D** is the most appropriate choice.

### Conclusion:
