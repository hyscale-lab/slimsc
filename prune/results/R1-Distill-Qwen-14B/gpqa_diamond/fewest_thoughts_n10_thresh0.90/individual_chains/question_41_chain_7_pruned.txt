Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving in a lab. Hmm, I remember that when light moves through a medium, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving, so how does that affect what an observer measures?

The question says the glass has an index of refraction n. The light beam is going through the glass which is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam, so the glass is moving in the same direction the light is going. And the observer is in the lab, so the lab is the rest frame.

I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Let me think about the basic principles. The speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? Where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's from the medium's rest frame. But here, the medium itself is moving. So do I need to apply a velocity addition formula here, like from special relativity?

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, the light is moving through a medium that's itself moving. Maybe I should think about the transformation of velocities.

In special relativity, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c² ), but wait, that's when you have two frames moving relative to each other. But here, the medium is moving, and we're trying to find the observed speed of light in that moving medium.

Wait, but light's speed in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame, right? But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the speed of light within it? Or is that not the case? Wait, I think light's speed in a medium is dependent on the medium's properties, but the overall speed might still have some relativistic effects when the medium itself is moving.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because the refractive index is a property of the medium at rest. But when the medium is moving, does that change the refractive index as seen from the lab frame? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it using the frame of the glass and then transform back to the lab frame.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed c/n. Now, the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab. So from the lab's perspective, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's as straightforward as adding velocities. Because the light's speed in the moving medium isn't just a simple addition. Let me think again.

The problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So, in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So, perhaps the lab would measure the speed as (c/n + v) / (1 + (v*c)/(n c) ) ?

Wait, let me write that out. Using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. If u is the speed of light in the medium's frame, and the medium is moving at speed v in the same direction, then the observed speed u' in the lab is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)).

But wait, in this case, u would be c/n. So substituting, u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ) ]

Hmm, let's compute that. Let me write the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (c + n v)/n

Denominator: 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c )

So u' becomes [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c/(n c + v) ) ] = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, let's see: (c + n v) * c is c² + n v c, and the denominator is (n
