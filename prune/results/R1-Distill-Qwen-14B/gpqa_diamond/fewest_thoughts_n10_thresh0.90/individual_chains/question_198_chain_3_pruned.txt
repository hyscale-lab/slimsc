Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with stability constants and complexation equilibria. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The setup is a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Wait, stability constants. Right, stability constants (β) are the equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes. For a metal ion M^n+ and ligand L, the formation of complexes ML, ML2, etc., would have their own β values. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

In this case, the metal is Co^2+ and the ligand is SCN^- (thiocyanate). So the possible complexes are Co(SCN)_n where n is 1,2,3,4. The stability constants given are for each step. Hmm wait, no—wait, no, the stability constants are for the overall formation. Or wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. For a complex like Co(SCN)_n, the stability constant β_n is Kf for the reaction Co^(n+) + n SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_n. So for each n, the β is the overall formation constant for that complex.

So, with the given β's, the complexes are:

n=1: β1=9 → CoSCN^+?

n=2: β2=40 → Co(SCN)_2^0? Wait, no, Co is 2+ and each SCN is -, so two SCN would make it neutral. So the complex is Co(SCN)_2.

n=3: β3=63 → Co(SCN)_3^2−. Because 2+ + 3*(-1) = -1 per SCN. Wait, 3 SCN would make 3*(-1) = -3. So 2+ -3 = -1. So the charge would be -1, so the complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^−.

n=4: β4=16 → Co(SCN)_4^2−. Because 2+ +4*(-1) = 2-4= -2. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Wait, I'm not sure about the charges, but perhaps that's not the most critical part right now. The key is that each β represents the stability of a complex with n SCN ligands. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be with two SCN ligands, so the [Co(SCN)_2] complex. So we need to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the [Co(SCN)_2] form.

Wait, but wait. The question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." I remember that the color of the complex depends on the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is blue, I think. Or wait, wait. Let me correct that. Wait, the Co^2+ with different SCN ligands. Oh wait, [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is actually a deep blue color, which is the well-known complex. So the complex with n=4 is blue. Wait, but earlier I thought dithiocyanato is n=2, but perhaps the question is referring to the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− as the blue complex. Hmm, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think again. 

Wait, the term dithiocyanato might refer to two SCN ligands, so n=2. But wait, the common blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which
