Okay, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of equilibrium problems. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, along with some stability constants. Hmm, stability constants, right. Those are the formation constants for the complexes, I think. Each β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands.

The problem states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are 9, 40, 63, and 16 respectively. Wait, but wait, what's the order here? Usually, stability constants increase with the number of ligands, but here β3 is 63, which is higher than β2 (40), but β4 is 16. Oh, that's interesting. So the fourth complex has a lower stability constant than the second. That probably means that the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^(n), where n depends on the charge, but I'll have to figure that out.

But wait, the question is specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, so that's the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex, right? Because Co^2+ with two SCN^- (each SCN^- is -1) would give a +2 charge: 2+ (Co) + 2*(-1) (SCN) = 0 charge? Wait no, that can't be. Wait, Co^2+ plus two SCN^- would be Co(SCN)_2^0? No, that's neutral. Or wait, maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^+ because the charge would be 2+ (Co^2+) + 2*(-1) SCN^- each, so 2+ - 2 = 0. Hmm, no, that's neutral. But wait, maybe the charge is different. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where m depends on n. For example, if n=1, then [Co(SCN)]^+ (because Co^2+ plus one SCN^- gives Co^+?), wait that doesn't add up. Wait, let's think: Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+, because 2+ -1= +1. Oh, right. So each SCN adds a -1, so each Co^2+ with n SCN- will have a charge of (2+ -n). So for n=1, it's +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2. Hmm. But the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Wait, but sometimes the charge might be different, but I think that's correct.

Anyway, the problem is to find the percentage of that particular complex among all Co species. So I'll need to calculate the concentration of the [Co(SCN)_2] complex relative to all other Co species.

I remember that when dealing with complexes and their stability, we can model the situation using the stability constants and the concentrations. The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their equilibrium concentrations, then find the fraction each contributes.

The species present would be:

- Free Co^2+ (let's call it Co^2+),
- [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1),
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2),
- [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3),
- [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4).

Each of these has a certain stability constant, β. The β for each complex is the formation constant for that complex. So, β1 is for the first complex (n=1), β2 for n=2, and so on.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}].

But wait, the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the next complex. So β1 is [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]), β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-]), and so on.

Hmm, but I need to model the fraction of each complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the distribution of the species based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

Another approach is to use the concept of the formation of complexes step by step and calculate the fraction for each. Since the problem asks specifically for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^0), which is the n=2 complex, I can compute its concentration relative to all others.

But how do I model the distribution? I think I can use the method of successive approximations or consider the dominant species. Alternatively, since the problem is about the relative concentrations, perhaps I can use the formula for the fraction of each species.

The fraction f_n of each complex can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^{n-1}) ) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN^-]^{k-1} )

Wait, is that correct? Let me think: the fraction for each complex is determined by the cumulative product of the β's and the [SCN^-] terms.

Alternatively, each species [Co(SCN)_n] can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and the β's. So, [Co(SCN)_n] = [Co^2+] * β1 * β2 * ... * β_{n-1} * [SCN^-]^{n-1}.

Wait, no. Because each β is the equilibrium constant for adding one more ligand. So for the first complex:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-].

For the second complex:

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [CoSCN^+][SCN^-] = β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, for the third:

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 [Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3.

And for the fourth:

[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = β4 [Co(SCN)_3^-][SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

So, each higher complex is formed by multiplying the previous concentration by β_n and another [SCN^-].

The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all these:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}].

Substituting each term:

[Co^2+] = x (let's let x = [Co^2+]).

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN^-].

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3.

[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4.

So,

x + β1 x [S] + β1 β2 x [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [S]^4 = c(Co)

where [S] is the [SCN^-], which is 0.1 M.

We can factor out x:

x (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 ) = c(Co)

So, x = c(Co) / (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 )

Once x is found, the concentration of each complex can be calculated, and the percentage for the n=2 complex can be determined.

But wait, the problem gives the stability constants as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And [S] is 0.1 M.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute the denominator terms:

Term 0: 1
Term 1: β1 [S] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
Term 2: β1 β2 [S]^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6
Term 3: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 = 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3. Let's compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. (0.1)^3 = 1e-3. So 22680 * 1e-3 = 22.68.
Term 4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 = 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4. Let's compute 9 *40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16=362880. (0.1)^4 =1e-4. So 362880 * 1e-4 = 36.288.

So the denominator becomes:

1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 +36.288 = Let's sum them.

Add 1 +0.9 = 1.9.

1.9 +3.6 = 5.5.

5.5 +22.68 = 28.18.

28.18 +36.288 = 64.468.

So the denominator is 64.468. So x = (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Wait, 1e-2 is 0.01. So x ≈ 0.01 /64.468 ≈ approximately 0.0001551 M.

Now, the concentration of the [Co(SCN)_2] complex is β1 β2 x [S]^2.

Which is 9 *40 * x * (0.1)^2.

Wait, but x is [Co^2+], so [Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 x [S]^2.

So compute:

β1 β2 = 9*40=360.

[S]^2 = 0.01.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = 360 * x * 0.01.

We have x ≈1.551e-4.

So 360 * 1.551e-4 = Let's compute 1.551e-4 * 360.

1.551e-4 *360 = (1.551 *360) *1e-4.

1.551 *360 = Let's see, 1.5 *360=540, 0.051 *360=18.36 → total 558.36.

So 558.36e-4 = 0.055836.

Then multiply by 0.01 (from [S]^2): 0.055836 *0.01 = 0.00055836 M.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in the expression for [Co(SCN)_2], it's β1 β2 x [S]^2.

Wait, but β1 β2 is 360, x is [Co^2+] which is 1.551e-4, and [S]^2 is (0.1)^2=0.01.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = 360 * 1.551e-4 * 0.01 = 360 * 1.551e-6.

360 *1.551e-6 = 0.00055836 M.

Wait, that's 5.5836e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] is 5.5836e-4 M.
