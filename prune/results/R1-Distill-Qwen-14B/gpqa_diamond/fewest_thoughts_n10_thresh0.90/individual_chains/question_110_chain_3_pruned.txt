Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each of these instruments has different capabilities, especially regarding the brightness of the stars they can observe.

Let me start by reading the question again. The question gives five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various parameters, and I need to determine which ones can be seen by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

From the problem statement, I know that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait, the question says stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. But wait, wait, magnitude is a bit counterintuitive. Oh right, lower magnitudes mean brighter. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is less than (brighter than) 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Wait no, wait: the way it's phrased is "brighter than 17 mag", so that would be apparent magnitude less than 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, the limit is V <= 17.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the limit is V <=16.

So the star must have an apparent V magnitude that is <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES. So the star's apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 16, because that's the stricter limit. Wait, no: because both instruments must be able to observe it. So the star must be bright enough for both. So, the apparent V must be <=16 for HIRES and <=17 for ESPRESSO. So the star's V must be <=16. Because if it's 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't (since HIRES only goes down to 16). So the star must have V <=16.

Wait wait, no. Let me think again. Let's think in terms of what each can observe. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <=17 (i.e., up to 17, so brighter than 17 is fainter than what they can observe). HIRES can observe stars with V <=16.
