Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the expectation value of spin along the y-direction. Hmm, let me think. The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused about how spin states are represented. I think spin states are usually written as column vectors, right? Like, for a two-level system, it's a two-element vector. So maybe (3i, 4) is the state vector, which would be [3i, 4]^T? Or perhaps it's a row vector? Oh wait, in quantum mechanics, spin states are column vectors. So the state is ψ = [3i, 4]^T. 

The question asks for the expectation value of S_y. I remember that the expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Right, so I need to find the matrix representation of S_y. Oh, wait, the note says σ_y is given as a matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

And since S_y is the spin operator, it's ħ/2 times σ_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. That part I'm pretty sure about. So, the matrix would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that σ_y matrix. 

So σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, and S_y is also a 2x2 matrix. The expectation value is the bra-ket product of ψ with S_y acting on ψ. So first, I need to compute S_y |ψ⟩, then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|.

Let me write down the steps. First, compute S_y |ψ⟩. Let's compute that. 

The state ψ is [3i, 4]^T. Let me denote it as a column vector:

ψ = [3i; 4]

So S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y, which is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

So when I multiply S_y by ψ, I get:

S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [ [0*(-3i) + (-i)*4] , [i*3i + 0*4] ]^T.

Wait, wait, no, matrix multiplication is done row times column. Let me compute each element:
