Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the excitation levels of atoms are related to their temperatures. Oh wait, this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution, right?

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait. So the ratio of the populations is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2 for that energy level. But wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, 1.38 is a familiar number... Oh, right! 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So that energy difference must be related to kT.

In LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (say, upper and lower) is given by n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. So I think it's the ratio of the number of excited atoms in that level relative to another. Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the upper level to the lower level. Let's say for each star, the ratio is n1_upper/n1_lower for star 1 and n2_upper/n2_lower for star 2.

But the problem states that for star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So let's write that down: (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower).

Wait, no, the sentence says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... compared to star_2." So perhaps the excitation is the number in the upper state. So the ratio of the upper level to the lower level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But perhaps it's better to model it as the ratio of the excited state to ground state. Let me think again. So, let me denote the ratio as R1 = (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) for star 1, and R2 = (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) for star 2. The problem says R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, no, the problem states that the excitation is twice, so R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( - ΔE/(k T) ). Assuming that the energy levels are the same for both stars (same ΔE), and that the statistical weights g are the same (since it's the same transition in the same element), then g
