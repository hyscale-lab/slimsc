Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of energy levels in atoms is governed by the Boltzmann equation when the gas is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. So, the population ratio matters here. Let me think, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, the problem states that iron atoms are twice as excited in star_1. So, n1/n2 = 2. But wait, no, wait. Star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So in star_1, the number of atoms in that energy level is higher. So n1 = 2 * n2? Or maybe it's the ratio n1/n2 = 2? I think that's right.

Assuming that the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) are the same for both stars, since they're the same element. So the ratio of the populations is (n1/n2) = exp[ -(E_i - E_j)/(k T1) ] / exp[ -(E_i - E_j)/(k T2) ]? Wait, no. Wait, the energy difference is the same for both stars because it's the same energy levels. So the energy E is the difference between two levels, which is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me note that down.

So the ratio n1/n2 = [ (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ] because each star has its own temperature. Oh wait, but wait, the ratio n1/n2 is 2. So:

2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Because the statistical weights would cancel if they're the same for both stars, which they are since it's the same transition in the same element.

Simplifying that, 2 = exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

Which can be written as ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the exponents. Let me re-express the ratio:

n1/n2 = exp( [ -(E1 - E2)/k T1 ] ) / exp( [ -(E1 - E2)/k T2 ] )

Wait, no. Let me think again because the energy levels are for each star. For star 1, the exponent is -ΔE/(k T1), and for star 2, it's -ΔE/(k T2). So when you take the ratio, you
