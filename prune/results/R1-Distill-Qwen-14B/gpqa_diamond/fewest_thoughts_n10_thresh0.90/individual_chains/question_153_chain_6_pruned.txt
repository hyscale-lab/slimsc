Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the reactants and products. Then, I have to match them with the options given.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt and EtOH. The product is A.

Wait, okay, the Michael addition involves a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, in this case, I think dimethyl malonate is the enolate source, right?

Dimethyl malonate is a good diethyl ester, and under basic conditions (like NaOEt), it can form an enolate. The enolate will attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. 

So, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituent. Wait, no, wait, the (E) configuration: the carbonyl is on one end, and the p-tolyl group is on the other end of the double bond. So it's CH2-CH(p-tolyl) connected to the acrylate part.

Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So, the structure is probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the beta carbon? Wait, noâ€”wait, for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, I might be getting that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2
