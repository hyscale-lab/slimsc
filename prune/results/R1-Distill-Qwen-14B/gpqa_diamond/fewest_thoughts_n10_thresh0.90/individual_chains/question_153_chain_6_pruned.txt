Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. It's a conjugate addition, right? So the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, and that creates an enolate intermediate which is resonance-stabilized. 

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them to the options given.

Let's start with part A. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? I think it's a dienophile or a dienophile isn't it? Or wait, no, in the Michael reaction, dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile because it's a good electron donor. Oh right, the enolate form. So in this case, the base NaOEt would deprotonate the alpha position of the malonate. Wait, but malonate is a diacid, so deprotonation would form an enolate.

So the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, the substituents. Let me think: the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl), so the structure would be something like CH2=CH- with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, wait, perhaps more accurately: the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, the numbering. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. So perhaps it's CH2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=COOCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=C(CO2Me)-p-tolyl. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the carbonyl is at C3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2 end. Wait, no, the (E) configuration implies that the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite. So for (E)-3-(
