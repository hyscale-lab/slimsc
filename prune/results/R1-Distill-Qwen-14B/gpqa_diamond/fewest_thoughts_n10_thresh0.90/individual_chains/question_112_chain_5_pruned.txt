Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's start by understanding what the problem says.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, but since it's proportional, I think I need to normalize this state first. Because to find probabilities, the state should be a unit vector.

So the state is a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states. Let me write it as |alpha> = c_up |up> + c_down |down>, where c_up = (1+i) and c_down = (2-i). But since it's proportional, the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, divided by the normalization factor.

The normalization factor N is the square root of (|c_up|^2 + |c_down|^2). Let me compute each modulus squared.

|c_up|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i)=1 +1=2. Wait, no, modulus squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 because (1+i) has real part 1 and imaginary part 1, so yes, modulus squared is 1^2 +1^2=2.

Similarly, |c_down|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total modulus squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is sqrt(7), so the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but the question says it's proportional, so maybe the state isn't necessarily normalized yet. But for probabilities, I think I need it to be normalized. So I'll proceed with this normalized state.

Next part of the question: Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, A is a 2x2 matrix since the basis is |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of Sz (spin-z). So let me write out matrix A.

Because for a 2x2 matrix, the elements are A11, A12, A21, A22.

The problem says Aij is ħ/2 if i≠j, else zero. So A11=0, A22=0, A12=A21= ħ/2.

Wait, wait no: Wait, matrix indices for a spin-1/2 system are usually either up and down. So A_ij is defined as the element in row i, column j. So for i≠j, Aij= ħ/2, else zero. So the matrix is:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0   ]

Hmm, that's the matrix. Now, we need to find the eigenstates of this operator A. Because the question asks about measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. So the possible outcomes when measuring A would be the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to find the eigenstates of A first.

So, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. The matrix is:

0   ħ/2
ħ/2 0

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ^2 - (ħ^2/4) = 0.

So λ^2 = ħ^2/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v =0 → [ -λ   ħ/2     ] [v1]   =0
[ ħ/2   -λ   ] [v2]

So substituting λ = ħ/2:

Row 1: (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 1). So the eigenvector can be written as (1,1)/sqrt(2), but I'll just note that the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/√2, since that's the standard basis for spin-x (since the Pauli X matrix has the same form as A/ (ħ/2)).

Wait, A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, which are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

Therefore, the possible measurement outcomes are ± ħ/2, and the probabilities are the square of the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

Let me compute the overlap with each eigenstate.

First, let me compute < + | alpha >.

|+> is (|up> + |down>)/√2. So,

< + | alpha > = [ ( < up | + < down | ) /√2 ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ].

Multiplying through:

= [ (1+i) * <up|up> + (2-i) * <down|up> ) + (1+i) <up|down> + (2-i) <down|down> ) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

But <up|up> = 1, <down|down> =1, <up|down>=0, <down|up>=0.

So this simplifies to:

[ (1+i) + (2-i) ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

Wait, let me compute numerator: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i =3.

So < + | alpha > = 3 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

The probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9 /14 ≈ 0.642857.

Hmm, wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857. So the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is 9/14 ≈ 0.643.

Now, < - | alpha >.

|-> is (|up> - |down>)/√2. So,

< - | alpha > = [ ( < up | - < down | ) /√2 ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

Again, multiplying through:

= [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2-i) <down|up> ) - (1+i) <up|down> - (2-i) <down|down> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Simplify:

= [ (1+i) - (2-i) ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Because <up|down> is zero, and < down| up> is zero.

So the numerator is (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + (i + i) = (-1) + 2i.

So < - | alpha > = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 / 14.

The modulus squared of (-1+2i) is (1^2 + 2^2) = 1+4=5.

So the probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but wait, wait! Let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, the numerator is (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 + i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i. So yes, that's correct.

The modulus squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So 5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let me compute those:

9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is approximately 0.643.

5/14 ≈ 0.35714, which is approximately 0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to these values. Option B is 0.54 and 0.46, which doesn't match. Option C is 0.28 and 0.72, which also doesn't match. Option D is 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't match.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product for |->.

Wait, let's see:

< - | alpha > is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) ?

Wait, no, wait: The state |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) /sqrt(7).

So when I compute < - | alpha >, it's [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ) ] multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product is:

( (1+i) * <up|up> + (2-i) * <down|up> ) - ( (1+i) * <up|down> + (2-i) * <down|down> ) ) / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

But <up|down> is zero, so the terms with those are zero.

So it's ( (1+i)*1 + (2-i)*0 ) - ( (1+i)*0 + (2-i)*1 ) )

So that's (1+i) - (2 -i) ) = (1 -2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

Yes, that's correct. So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait, wait: Another approach: perhaps the operator A is a Hermitian matrix, so it's diagonalizable, and the eigenstates are |+> and |-> as I found. Then, the probabilities are |< + | alpha >|^2 and |< - | alpha >|^2.

So the first probability is 9/14, which is approximately 0.642857, and the second is 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Looking at the options, option A gives 0.64 and 0.36, which is very close. So the probabilities would be approximately 64% and 36%, matching option A.

But wait, the question also asks for the average value of the operator A.

The average value (expectation value) is < alpha | A | alpha >.

But since |alpha> is already expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, perhaps it's easier to compute this using the matrix form.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, its expectation can be found as the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation is the weighted average of the eigenvalues.

So, the expectation value would be P(+) * (ħ/2) + P(-) * (-ħ/2).

Which is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) /14 ] * ħ/2 = (4/14) * ħ/2 = (2/7) * ħ/2 = ħ/(7).

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is ħ/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me double-check the expectation value calculation using another method.

Another approach: Compute < alpha | A | alpha >.

So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

A is the matrix:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

So <alpha| A |alpha> is [ ( (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Let me compute this.

First, the vector <alpha| is ( (1 - i) , (2 + i) ) / sqrt(7).

Multiplying by A: A * |alpha> is:

Row 1: 0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)*(2 - i) → (ħ/2)(2 - i)
Row 2: (ħ/2)(1 + i) + 0*(2 - i) → (ħ/2)(1 + i)

So A |alpha> is [ (ħ/2)(2 - i) ; (ħ/2)(1 + i) ]

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of <alpha| with A|alpha>:

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 - i) , (ħ/2)(1 + i) ) ]^T

= (1 - i)(2 - i) (ħ/2) / sqrt(7) + (2 + i)(1 + i) (ħ/2) / sqrt(7)

Wait, let me compute each term.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = (2-1) -3i = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 +i) = 2(1) + 2i + i(1) +i^2 = 2 + 3i -1 = (2-1) +3i =1 +3i.

So adding the two terms:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the total is [ 2 * (ħ/2) ) ] / sqrt(7) → (2 * ħ/2) ) / sqrt(7) → ħ / sqrt(7) / sqrt(7)? Wait, no. Wait, let me redo the calculation.

Wait, the inner product is [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(7).

Wait, wait, no: The inner product is ( (1 - i) * (ħ/2)(2 - i) ) + ( (2 + i) * (ħ/2)(1 + i) ) ) divided by sqrt(7).

So each term is multiplied by (ħ/2).

So let me compute:

Term1: (1 - i)(2 -i ) * (ħ/2) = [ (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) ] * (ħ/2).

Which is (2 -i -2i + i^2 ) → 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 = -1) → (1 -3i).

Term2: (2 +i)(1 +i) * (ħ/2) → [ 2*1 + 2i +i*1 + i^2 ] → (2 +3i -1) → (1 +3i).

So sum of terms inside is (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So the inner product is (2) * (ħ/2) / sqrt(7) → (2 (ħ/2)) / sqrt(7) → (ħ) / sqrt(7).

Wait, so the expectation value is ħ / sqrt(7), but earlier when I computed
