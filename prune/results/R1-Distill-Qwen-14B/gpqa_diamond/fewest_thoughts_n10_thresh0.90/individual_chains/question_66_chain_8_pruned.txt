Okay, I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT symmetry question. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. I remember that effective theories are used when you have some high-energy physics that you can't see directly, so you write down all possible interactions respecting certain symmetries.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let's go through each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT should respect this because all the operators are built from the Standard Model fields, which already obey Lorentz symmetry. Effective theories usually preserve the symmetries of the underlying theory, which the Standard Model does. So operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz covariant.

Then Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But in an effective theory, you might have higher-dimensional operators which can break some symmetries like scaling (like in the Standard Model, because it's not renormalizable). But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's valid below a certain cutoff. Do they respect Poincare? I think all operators must have the same spacetime indices structure to respect Poincare. But wait, the question is whether all operators must respect it. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but I'm a bit confused about Poincare. Wait, Lorentz symmetry is included in Poincare, which includes translations as well. But the SMEFT is valid at low energies, so it's built in a way that allows for Lorentz symmetry but maybe not necessarily translation symmetry in a strict sense? Or perhaps in the effective theory, the operators are local, so they do respect translations. Hmm. I think that SMEFT operators are indeed Poincare-invariant because they're written in terms of the SM fields, which are Poincare-symmetric. So both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected.

Next, CP symmetry. SMEFT doesn't necessarily require CP symmetry. In fact, beyond the Standard Model physics often violates CP, like in the case of certain operators that generate the strong CP problem, or in models of CP violation. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So not all operators must respect CP. So option 3 is out.

CPT symmetry. From what I remember, CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. The SMEFT is built within the framework of QFT, so it must respect CPT symmetry. All the operators constructed in SMEFT are CPT-invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4 which is option C. Wait, the options given are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So the correct answer would include Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the underlying Standard Model while incorporating higher-dimensional operators. Let us analyze the symmetries in question:
