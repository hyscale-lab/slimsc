Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you consider all possible higher-dimensional operators that can be added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, respecting certain symmetries. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Let me think. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare, CP, and CPT. So I need to figure out which of these are symmetries that SMEFT operators must obey.

First, what's the deal with these symmetries? Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their constant velocity or orientation in space. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time, right? But wait, in a field theory, Poincare includes the symmetries of spacetime translations, Lorentz transformations, etc. So if SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. Because all the operators in SMEFT are built as Lorentz-invariant operators, right? So options 1 and 2 are probably correct.

CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). CPT symmetry is the combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. But wait, in the Standard Model, CPT is a symmetry, but not all theories necessarily respect CP. SMEFT, as a low-energy effective theory, should respect all the symmetries that the underlying theory (like the Standard Model) respects. So if the Standard Model is CPT symmetric, then SMEFT must respect it as well because you're adding terms that don't break it. But wait, does SMEFT require CP symmetry? Because I remember that the SM doesn't have CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix. So maybe SMEFT doesn't require all operators to respect CP symmetry, because the SM itself doesn't. But CPT is a different story. Because in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT is a symmetry. Wait, no, is that true? Because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the CPT theorem says that if a theory is Lorentz symmetric and has some other conditions, then it must have CPT symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So let me list the options again.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Must be respected because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory.

2. Poincare symmetry: Since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, and SMEFT must respect all spacetime symmetries, including translations. Wait, but operators in SMEFT come with higher dimensions, but when you add operators, they should still transform properly under Poincare. So yes, Poincare symmetry is part of what SMEFT respects.

3. CP symmetry: The operators may or may not respect CP. For example, if the underlying SM has CP violation, then the effective operators can include terms that violate CP. So SMEFT doesn't require all operators to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must for all operators.

4. CPT symmetry: As I thought earlier, since SMEFT is Lorentz invariant, the CPT theorem applies. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So looking at the options, which of the four statements must hold for all SMEFT operators.

So the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3). So which options include 1, 2, and 4? Let's look at the options.

The options are:

A) 1,2 → includes only 1 and 2.

B) 3,4 → 3 and 4. But 3 isn't required, so this is wrong.

C) 1,2,4 → yes, this includes all three.
