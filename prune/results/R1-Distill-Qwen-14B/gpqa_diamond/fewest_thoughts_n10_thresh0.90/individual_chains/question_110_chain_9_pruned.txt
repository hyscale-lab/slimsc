Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are detectable by both. Let me think through each star step by step.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth, its apparent magnitude, is what matters here. Because both spectrographs have different brightness limits. So ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can see brighter than 16 mag. So the star's apparent V magnitude needs to be less than (or equal to) 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Because lower magnitudes are brighter, right?

Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, so that would be apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent magnitude ≤16.

Wait, wait. If a star is brighter (has a lower apparent magnitude), both can detect it. But if a star is too faint (high mag), some can't.

So each star must have apparent V mag ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because only if the star's mag is ≤16, it's detectable by both? Because if it's above 17, ESPRESSO can't, and if it's above 16, HIRES can't. So for both to detect it, the apparent V must be ≤16.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be detectable by ESPRESSO and by HIRES. So for detection, the apparent V mag must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So the star's apparent V must meet both conditions. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16. Because if it's, say, 17, HIRES can't detect it because it's only up to 16. But if a star is 16, both can detect it. So the
