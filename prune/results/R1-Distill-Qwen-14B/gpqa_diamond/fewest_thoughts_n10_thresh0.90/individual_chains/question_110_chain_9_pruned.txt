Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that both these spectrographs are high-resolution ones used for various astronomical observations. But each has its own limitations when it comes to the brightness of the stars they can observe. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can handle stars brighter than 16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag (which is fainter) can't be seen by ESPRESSO, but brighter than 16 mag (which is fainter) can't be seen by HIRES. Wait, wait, I think I got that backwards. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. Oh right, so a star with a V magnitude of 17 is dimmer than a star at 16. So, ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 mag (so up to 17, or including 17?), while HIRES can see up to 16 mag. So both would need a star that is bright enough for both, which would mean the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 for HIRES, and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be bright enough that it's within the observing range of both instruments.

So, let's look at each star and compute their apparent V magnitude. Wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes given, others have apparent. Let me go through them one by one.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude 15.5, at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d is 10 pc, so log10(1) is 0. So m = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Now, can ESPRESSO and HIRES see this? ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so yes. HIRES can up to 16. So 15.5 is ≤16
