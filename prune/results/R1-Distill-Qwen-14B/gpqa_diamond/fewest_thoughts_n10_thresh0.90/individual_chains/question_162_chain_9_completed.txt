Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry, I'm not exactly sure. The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2 using a given metric.

The metric is given as ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, wait. I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor defines the geometry of spacetime, and for a sphere, we can compute its area using the metric.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, in relativity, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, which is also called a hyperbolic space. But wait, in this case, the metric is given in terms of x and y, so it's probably a 2-dimensional space, since dx and dy are the differentials.

Wait, but the question mentions a pseudosphere, which is a 2-dimensional object. So maybe this is a 2D space described by the metric. And the question is about the area of this pseudosphere. Or wait, perhaps it's the area of the universe described by this metric?

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a 2-sphere, but given the form, I'm thinking it's a 2D hyperbolic space because the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Wait, for a 2-sphere, the metric is usually in terms of radius, but this seems different.

Wait, the standard metric for a 2-sphere is ds² = a² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²), but this is different. Alternatively, if the metric is given in flat space coordinates, perhaps it's conformally flat. The given metric is conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric (dx² + dy²). So the line element is multiplied by a function, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, the area in such a metric would be computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface. But for a conformally flat metric, it's easier because the determinant is just the square of the conformal factor.

So the metric in 2D is:

g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

So the determinant of g is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The area element dA would be (1/2) * sqrt(det g) dx dy? Wait, or is it sqrt(det g) dx dy? Let me think. In 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Because the volume element (in 2D, area) is sqrt(det g) dx^i dx^j? No, wait, the line element squared is g_{ij} dx^i dx^j. The area element is sqrt(det g) dx^1 dx^2. So yes, it's sqrt(det g) times dx dy.

So, the determinant det g is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the area element is sqrt([32/(4 - x² - y²)]²) dx dy. The square root of a square is the absolute value, but since 4 - x² - y² must be positive for the metric to be real (since otherwise the denominator becomes zero or negative, which would cause the metric to blow up), so 4 - x² - y² > 0. So the square root is positive, so we have 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy as the area element.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the area would then be the integral of 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy over the region where x² + y² < 4. So the integral is over a disk of radius 2, because x² + y² <4. So the integral would be the area of a circle times some scaling factor.

Wait, the area is ∫∫ (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ, where r is the radial coordinate and θ is the angle. Converting to polar coordinates. So let's do that.

Make substitution with x² + y² = r². So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to r=sqrt(4) (which is 2), and θ from 0 to 2π.

So A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So factor out the 32 and the r: 32 ∫ from 0 to 2π dθ ∫ from 0 to 2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the integrals step by step.

First, the angular integral: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

Next, the radial integral: ∫0 to 2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So the integral becomes ∫u=4 to u=0 [ (1/u) * (-1/2) du ].

Which is (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du = (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

Wait, let's re-express. The substitution:

∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

= ∫ [r/(u)] dr, where u=4-r².

du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-1/2) * (1/u) ] du.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (4 → 0) (1/u) du.

= (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

= (-1/2) [ ln 0 - ln 4 ].

But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral is (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] which is (-1/2)(-infty - ln4) → positive infinity? Because (-infty) is negative, so [ (-infty) - ln4 ] is negative infinity, multiplied by (-1/2), becomes positive infinity.

Wait, but that suggests that the integral diverges, so the area is infinite.

But wait, why is that? Let me think about the metric. The denominator is 4 - r², which approaches zero as r approaches 2. So the conformal factor blows up at r=2, which is the boundary of the space. So the area integral would have a singularity there.

Wait, but in the case of a sphere, the area is finite because the metric doesn't blow up. But here, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²), which goes to infinity as r approaches 2. So the area element becomes infinite near the edge. So the total area would be infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

So the area is infinite. So the correct answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere, we calculate the area element \(dA\) using the determinant of the metric tensor. For a conformally flat metric of the form \(g = \lambda^2 (dx^2 + dy^2)\), the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \lambda^2 \, dx \, dy.
\]

Here, \(\lambda^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\), so the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The total area \(A\) is obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the region where the metric is defined, which corresponds to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\) (to keep the denominator positive). Converting to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\). The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \cdot \frac{-1}{2} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln u\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). This indicates that the area element becomes infinite at the boundary \(r = 2\), where the metric blows up. Therefore, the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
