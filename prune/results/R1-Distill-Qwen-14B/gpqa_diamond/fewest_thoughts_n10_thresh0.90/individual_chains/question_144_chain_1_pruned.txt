Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's see if I can think this through step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, which gives me a clue about what formula to use.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, right? Because Γ is the decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime. But wait, I'm a bit confused between lifetime and mean path. Oh, right, the mean decay distance depends on the velocity of the particle and its lifetime. So the mean path L would be L = v * τ * c, or something like that. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula.

Wait, another thought: because particles decay, their mean lifetime is given by τ = (ħ)/(Γ). But since we're dealing with units where ħ is in GeV·s, or something like that, I need to make sure I'm handling the units correctly.

Wait, let me get this straight. The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to be careful with units. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, if Γ is in GeV, then τ would be in seconds.

But wait, in this problem, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV. So, tau would be ħ / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that.

But wait, the particle is moving, so its lifetime is dilated due to its velocity. So the proper lifetime is τ, but the observed lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), but wait, in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², so gamma would be E/(m c²) but since c is taken as 1, it's E/m.

Wait, the energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So the Lorentz factor gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So the observed lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ. So the mean lifetime experienced in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma * tau.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The mean lifetime in the rest frame is tau. But when the particle is moving, from the lab frame, it's moving with velocity v, so the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the lifetime observed is gamma * tau. So the lifetime I use in the mean path calculation is gamma * tau.

But let's see, the mean path length is L = v * t, where t is the observed lifetime. So L = v * gamma * tau. But tau is ħ / Γ.

Wait, but let's think in terms of units. I'm getting a bit stuck on the unit conversions here. Let me try to write down the formulas step by step.

First, compute the proper lifetime tau in the rest frame:

tau = ħ / Γ.

But ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, the particle is moving, so from the lab frame, its lifetime is longer by gamma. So the observed lifetime is gamma * tau.

Gamma is E / m. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6666667.

So the observed lifetime is 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371111e-23 s.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = c * gamma * beta * tau.

Because L is velocity times time, and velocity is beta c.

Hmm, I think I might have confused gamma and beta earlier.

Wait, let me think again. The mean lifetime observed is tau' = gamma tau. The velocity beta is v/c, so v = beta c.

So the mean path is L = v * tau' = beta c * gamma tau.

But tau is ħ / Gamma, so L = beta gamma c (ħ / Gamma).

Ah, right, so putting it all together: L = beta gamma c (ħ / Gamma).

But wait, since E = gamma m c^2, and E is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV/c^2. So gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV c²) * c². Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so gamma is E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 ≈6.6667.

So gamma is 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Also, beta can be found from gamma and the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So let's compute beta.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) → sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/gamma → 1 - beta² = 1/gamma² → beta² = 1 - 1/gamma².

Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444
