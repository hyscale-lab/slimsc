Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that they're spread out evenly in space. But I'm not totally sure what that implies. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Oh right, parallax is related to distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Wait, I remember that the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is closer, it has a larger plx. Parallax is measured in arcseconds.

The problem is asking how the number of stars per unit parallax changes with plx. So like, if you have a certain range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there per unit dplx?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that means their spatial density is uniform. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. But wait, how does that relate to parallax?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So for a given parallax range dplx, what's the corresponding distance range?

Let me think: plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So a small change in plx, say dplx, would correspond to a change in distance. Let's calculate that. If plx increases by dplx, how does d change?

If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let's take the derivative of d with respect to plx. So dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So the change in distance dd is approximately -dd/dplx * dplx, which is -( -1/(plx^2) ) * dplx = (1/plx²) * dplx. So the distance changes by about dplx/(plx²).

Wait, but when plx increases, distance decreases. So if plx is small, the number of stars in that small range would be in a larger volume, or smaller volume?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance. The number of stars in a shell would be proportional to the volume.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d
