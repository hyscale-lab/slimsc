Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and various hydrogens and oxygens.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably O-H stretching. Broad usually means it's an alcohol or something with hydrogen bonding, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, the problem mentions that the FTIR shows a very broad absorption, which is typical for an -OH group. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Next, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone (around 1700-1750) or maybe an ester or aldehyde. Wait, but 1650 is a bit lower than 1700. I'm thinking maybe conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Oh, like maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Or perhaps it's an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not. Another possibility is that the 1650 could be from an aromatic ring, like C=C stretching. Hmm.

Wait, but 1700 is a strong peak. So maybe there are two carbonyl groups? Like a ketone and an ester? Or perhaps one is another group. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else, like an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the problem states that there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so that suggests the compound has an alkene group. So, that's another functional group: a C=C double bond.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm. What fragments give m/z 45? Let's think about possible ions. 45 is  C3H7O maybe? Or maybe it's from a common fragment like C3H7 or something else. Alternatively, 45 could be a ketene ion (like CH2CO), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the molecular ion could be breaking down into smaller parts.

Now, let's think about the possible formulas given the options. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, I'll consider the degrees of unsaturation for each. The formula is C6HxOy. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no halogens or nitrogens are present, DoU = (2*6 + 2 - H - 0)/2.

So for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2
H=12. DoU = (14 - 12)/2 = 1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond, so at least one DoU. But option A has only one, so maybe another group, like an ester or something else. Wait, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: C6H10O
H=10. DoU = (14-10)/2 = 2. So two double bonds or rings. Maybe an aromatic ring (like benzene, which has three double bonds, but that's three DoU) but maybe a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2
H=10. DoU = (14-10)/2 = 2. So same as B, two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O
H=12. DoU = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU. But from the NMR, we have vinyl hydrogens, so that implies at least one. But if the only DoU is one, that would be a single double bond or ring.

Wait, but the FTIR suggests a carbonyl group (1700 cm^-1) which is a double bond, so that's one DoU. And the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, another double bond. So that would be two DoU. So which options have two DoU?

Looking again:

Option B: DoU 2 (so two DoU). Option C: DoU 2. Options A and D: DoU 1 each. So our compound must have two DoU. So the correct option is either B or C.

Wait, but let me think again. The FTIR shows a carbonyl (1700) and another peak at 1650. Could that 1650 be an aromatic ring? Because if the compound has a benzene ring, that's three DoU (from the three double bonds in benzene). But wait, the options B and C have DoU 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl group. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring, but that would require more DoU. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring plus a carbonyl group. But that would make the DoU 4 (3 from benzene, 1 from carbonyl). But the options B and C have DoU 2. So that doesn't add up. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 cm^-1 is not an aromatic ring. What else could that be? Maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). Because in such a structure, the conjugation between the double bond and the carbonyl can cause a shift in the carbonyl peak. So the peak at 1700 would be the carbonyl, and 1650 could be the C=C. So that way, the FTIR would show both peaks.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the DoU would be two: one for the carbonyl and one for the double bond (from the vinyl group). So that would fit options B and C, which have two DoU.

So maybe the compound has an ester group (which would have a carbonyl) and a double bond (the vinyl). Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an ester group, but that would require more oxygens.

Looking at the options, B is C6H10O, so one oxygen. C is C6H10O2, two oxygens. So for a carbonyl, like a ketone, we need one O. If the compound has an ester, that's O2.

Wait, the FTIR shows two carbonyl peaks? No, the 1700 and 1650. So maybe the 1700 is the carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring. But then that would require more DoU.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is due to an amide, but the options don't have N. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl. For example, in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the carbonyl peak might be at around 1700, and the C=C at 1650. So in that case, the FTIR shows two peaks indicating the presence of both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond.

So the compound has both a carbonyl (which adds a DoU) and a vinyl group (another DoU), giving a total of two DoU. So it's either option B or C.

Now, looking at the NMR: there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So that's the double bond.

Next, the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about what that could be. 45 is a common m/z for certain fragments. For example, the CH3CO+ ion is 45 (molecular weight of 45). Alternatively, the fragment could be from a ketone, like (CH3CO) would be 45. Wait, wait: molecular weight of CH3CO is 45 (12 + 3*1 + 12 + 16 = 44? Wait, wait: C: 12*2=24, H:3 + 2 = 5? No, wait. Wait, CH3CO is (CH3)2CO? No, no, wait. No, CH3CO is the acetyl group, which is C2H3O. Wait, molecular weight of CH3CO is 2*12 +5*1 +16 = 24 +5 +16 =45. So the fragment [CH3CO]+ would be at m/z 45.

So if the compound has an acetyl group (like an ester or ketone), the mass spectrum would show a peak at 45. So the fragment could be the acylium ion or something similar.

So let's think about the possible structures based on the options.

Option B: C6H10O. That could be something like an ester, but let's see. Wait, C6H10O, molecular weight is 6*12 +10*1 +16 =72+10+16=98.

Wait, but another way: alternative structures. For example, if it's methyl cyclopentane with a ketone group, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester. Wait, no, because an ester has two oxygen atoms. So option B has only one O, so it's not an ester; probably a ketone or an alcohol.

Option C: C6H10O2. This would have two O atoms, so possibly an ester or a ketone plus an alcohol. But esters have two O atoms. So for example, a cyclic ester (lactone) or a regular ester.

So, considering the mass spec fragment at 45, maybe the molecule breaks off into the acetyl group.

So, let's think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. So formula is C6H12O2. That would have a molecular weight of 6*12 +12 + 32=72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. Molecular weight: 6*12 +12 +16=72+12+16=100.

So, the molecular ion in mass spec would be around these values. But the given fragment is at 45, which is less than all of these molecular weights.

So, the fragment m/z 45 is likely a piece of the molecule. So, which of these compounds, when fragmented, would release a 45 m/z ion?

If the fragment is the acetyl group (CH3CO+), then the molecule would have an acetyl group, like an acetyl ester or a ketone.

Now, looking at the possible formulas.

Option C is C6H10O2. So, if the molecule is something like an ester with an acetyl group, maybe methyl acrylate or something similar.

Wait, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let's count the carbons: 3 from the acrylate part and 1 from methyl, so 4. But the formula here is C6, so perhaps it's a substituted version. Alternatively, maybe something like a diester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, another approach: the molecular formula must include an oxygen count that matches the functional groups.

From FTIR, we have an O-H (broad peak) and a carbonyl. Wait, wait. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which could be O-H (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid). But wait, the 1700 peak is a carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad and strong, which fits. But a carboxylic acid would have a formula with at least two oxygen (since it's RCOOH: O2). So looking at the options:

Option A: O2.

Option C: O2.

Option D: O1.

So if it's a carboxylic acid, then options A or C would be possible.

Wait, but the IR's 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which for a carboxylic acid is usually a bit lower, like around 1700 is correct, but sometimes higher.

Wait, but wait, another thought: maybe the compound is an ester. Esters have carbonyl groups (around 1700), and they don't have O-H groups unless they are alcohol-based, but if it's an ester and an alcohol, that would complicate.

Wait, but in the FTIR, the broad peak is at 3000, which suggests O-H. So more likely an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, not an ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol. But a ketone would have a peak around 1700, and an alcohol's O-H is broad around 3000.

But then, the compound would have both groups. So the oxygen count would be two (O from ketone and O from alcohol). So for option C, which has two oxygen atoms, that would fit.

Alternatively, a carboxylic acid has two O's: one from the -COOH group.

Let me try to think of a structure with a ketone and an alcohol. For example, cyclohexanol acetone? Not exactly, but perhaps something like that.

But maybe another approach is better. Let's see.

The molecular formula is either C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A), or others.

Wait, the problem says that the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So, that's another DoU.

So now, the total DoU is the number of rings plus double bonds:

Each DoU is a ring or a double bond.

So, for a molecule with a carbonyl (one DoU), a vinyl (another DoU), and an O-H group (maybe from an alcohol, which adds another O but doesn't contribute to DoU). So total DoU is 2.

So the formula should have DoU of 2.

Looking back, the options with DoU 2 are B and C.

Wait, option B: C6H10O. DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. So it can have two double bonds or one ring and one double bond. Alternatively, two rings.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is (14-10)/2=2.

So both have two DoU. So the compound has either an ester and a double bond, or a ketone and a double bond, etc.

But, in the FTIR, the broad peak at 3000 suggests an O-H, as in an alcohol. So, our compound has an alcohol group (O-H), a carbonyl group (O=C), and a double bond (C=C).

So that would be three functional groups. So the formula must have at least two O's, because it's an alcohol (O) and a carbonyl (O). So that's two O's. So the options A and C have two O's.

So, now, the options are:

A) C6H12O2: DoU=1 (since (14-12)/2=1) which would be a single ring or double bond. But we have a double bond and a carbonyl, which is two DoU, so this can't be A.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought the formula for A had DoU 1, but if the molecule has a carbonyl and a double bond, that's two DoU, but option A's DoU is only 1. So that's a conflict. Therefore, option A can't be right.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. That could be a carbonyl (1 DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), which fits. So that's possible.

So, if the formula is C6H10O2, that would have two O's. So, the functional groups could be an alcohol (O-H) and a ketone (O=C), and a double bond (C=C). But let me think about whether that's possible.

Wait, another possibility: if the compound is an ester and an alcohol. But that would require three O's, but option C only has two. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid (which has two O's: -COOH). So, the structure could be a substituted acrylic acid. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOH. But that would be C3H4O2. But our compound is C6H10O2, so perhaps it's a larger structure, maybe a substituted version.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, a lactone, which would have a ring and an ester group. But then the DoU would be based on the ring. Hmm.

Wait, the mass spec fragment at 45 suggests the presence of an acetyl group. So, perhaps the molecule has an ester group that includes an acetyl. For example, something like methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but that's four carbons. Our compound is six, so maybe it's a substituted version.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diethyl acetyl ester? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is something like methyl cyclohex-2-enecarboxylate. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound must match the options. So, considering the data, the correct option is C (C6H10O2) because:

1. FTIR shows O-H (broad 3000), carbonyl (1700), and possibly a C=C (1650).

2. NMR shows vinyl H's, so a double bond is present.

3. Mass spec has a fragment at 45, which suggests an acetyl group.

4. Formula must have two O's, which options A and C have. But option A has DoU=1, which can't account for the two functional groups (carbonyl and double bond), so option C is better.

So, the correct answer is option C, C6H10O2.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The options provided are:

- **A)** C6H12O2  
- **B)** C6H10O  
- **C)** C6H10O2  
- **D)** C6H12O  

### Analysis of the Data:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
   - A strong absorption peak at **1700 cm⁻¹** suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), such as a ketone or ester.
   - A peak at **1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl group or a C=C double bond.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (hydrogens on a double bond) indicate the presence of a C=C group.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is consistent with the acetyl group (CH3CO⁺), suggesting the presence of an acetyl group in the compound.

4. **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**:
   - The DoU is calculated as:  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
     \]
   - For the options:
     - **A)** C6H12O2: DoU = 1  
     - **B)** C6H10O: DoU = 2  
     - **C)** C6H10O2: DoU = 2  
     - **D)** C6H12O: DoU = 1  

   The compound must have **two DoU** to account for the carbonyl group (C=O) and the vinyl group (C=C). This eliminates **A** and **D**, which have only one DoU.

5. **Functional Groups and Formula**:
   - The FTIR data indicates the presence of an O-H group, a carbonyl group, and a double bond. These functional groups require at least **two oxygen atoms**, which rules out **B** (C6H10O, which has only one oxygen).
   - **C (C6H10O2)** satisfies all the criteria:
     - Two oxygen atoms for the O-H and carbonyl groups.
     - Two DoU to account for the carbonyl and vinyl groups.
     - The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with the presence of an acetyl group.

### Conclusion:
The compound must be **C6H10O2**, as it aligns with the FTIR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data, as well as the degree of unsaturation.

**Answer: C**
