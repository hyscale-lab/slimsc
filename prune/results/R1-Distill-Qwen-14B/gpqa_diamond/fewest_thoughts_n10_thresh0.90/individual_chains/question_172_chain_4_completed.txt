Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels in a thermal distribution. The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), right? Where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given, so E_i - E_j = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. The problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so n_i1 / n_j1 = 2, and n_i2 / n_j2 = 1 (if I'm comparing to the same energy level ratio in star_2). Or maybe I should think in terms of the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, maybe I should set up the ratios for both stars. Let's say for star 1: n_i1/n_j1 = 2. And for star 2: n_i2/n_j2 = 1. But wait, the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same energy levels being considered. So E_i - E_j is the same for both.

Wait, the question says that the energy difference is the same for both considered levels. So, the same ΔE applies to both stars.

So, the ratio for star 1 is (n_i1)/(n_j1) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2.

Similarly, for star 2: (n_i2)/(n_j2) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = 1.

Wait, but if the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, then their ratio would be 1. So the ratio simplifies to exp(-ΔE/(k T)) for each star.

So for star_1: 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

And for star_2: 1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, that can't be right. Because if star_2's ratio is 1, then ΔE/(k T2) would be zero? That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I mixed up the levels. Because when the energy is higher, the population is lower. So maybe in star_2, the excitation is such that the higher energy level is less populated. Wait, the problem says star_1 has iron atoms twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the higher energy level (i) is more populated in star_1.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) = 2 for star_1, and 1 for star_2.

So, for star_1: 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: 1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio would be larger. So star_1 has a higher temperature than star_2. Because 2 is bigger than 1.

Wait, let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So higher T makes the exponent smaller, so the ratio becomes larger. So if star_1 has a higher T, then the ratio (n_i/n_j) is larger than star_2.

So for star 1: 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: 1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, when star_2's ratio is 1, then exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = 1 → -ΔE/(k T2) = 0 → ΔE =0, which isn't the case. So maybe I messed up the ratio.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is n_i/n_j = something else. Let me think: the ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So in star_1, the ratio is 2, in star_2, it's 1. Let's suppose g_i/g_j is the same for both stars, so let's call that factor G.

So for star_1: 2 = G * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: 1 = G * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can divide the two equations to eliminate G.

Divide star_1 equation by star_2 equation:

2/1 = [ G exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ G exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

The G cancels out, so:

2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) )

Which simplifies to:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ].

Wait, but wait, the exponent is [ (ΔE)/(k) ) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

Let me rearrange that:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE / (k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, given that ΔE is positive (since the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is positive), and T1 is higher than T2 (since star_1 has higher excitation), then T1 - T2 is positive. So the right side is positive, which matches ln(2) positive.

So the equation is ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But wait, the question is about finding the correct equation regarding T1 and T2, so we can write this as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But looking at the options, none directly have ΔE, but the choices are about expressions involving T1 and T2. So perhaps we can rearrange this equation to express it in terms of T1 and T2 without ΔE.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the value of ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. And k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that's interesting. ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k in units.

So ΔE = k * something. Let me compute ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, so ΔE/(k) equals 1 K? Because 1.38e-23 J is the value of k (approx 1.38e-23 J/K). So yes, ΔE = k * 1 K → ΔE/k =1.

So substituting back:

ln(2) = (1) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So option D.

Wait, let me double-check. Because I thought the division was star_1 over star_2, so when I took the ratio, I ended up with that equation. So the correct option is D.


To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of energy levels in a thermal distribution:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the energy levels, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1, the excitation ratio is given as \(n_{i1}/n_{j1} = 2\), and for star_2, it is \(n_{i2}/n_{j2} = 1\). Assuming the statistical weights \(g_i/g_j\) are the same for both stars, the equations simplify to:

\[
2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing the equation for star_1 by the equation for star_2 eliminates the statistical weight factor:

\[
\frac{2}{1} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
