Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a diamond crystal. So the structure is a bit complex, but the key thing is it has two bromine atoms attached at the 1 and 3 positions.

First step: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction here. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, are the bromines on adjacent carbons in adamantane? Let me think. In adamantane, each carbon is bonded to three others, right? So 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So perhaps the reaction isn't a simple elimination. Hmm, maybe it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that KOH could cause a cleavage of the C-Br bonds. When two bromides are present, maybe it's a case for the formation of an epoxide or a similar structure. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the product's NMR spectrum, there's a peak around 4.79 ppm integrating for 2H. That's usually indicative of an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide. Oh wait, but in epoxides, the protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or something else.

Oh wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product after KOH might have a ketone group. Wait, but how? If we have two Br atoms, maybe a double elimination? Or perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to a ring-opening or some kind of cleavage.

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide reacts with a strong base like KOH, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But if the dihalide isn't vicinal, you can't form a double bond directly. Alternatively, maybe the base causes the cleavage of the carbon-bromine bonds, leading to the formation of a ketone. Oh! Because in some cases, when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, especially in a cyclic structure, the base can cause the cleavage of both C-Br bonds, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, in the cleavage of 1,2-dihaloalkanes with strong bases, you can get ketones.

So in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have both Br atoms cleaved by KOH, leading to the formation of an adamantyl group with a carbonyl. Wait, but where? Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so if Brs are at 1 and 3, after cleavage, perhaps the structure becomes something like a ketone in the center, maybe cyclohexanone or similar. Wait, but adamantane is more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone? Or perhaps it's a single ketone. The NMR data: the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2- group, but the IR has a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's an ether, but I'm not seeing the connection. Wait, perhaps it's not an elimination but a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution. Unless in a very polar aprotic solvent, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another angle. Let me think about the product's structure. The IR has a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is a ketone. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Wait, that seems like a CH2 next to an oxygen. Maybe it's a diether or something else. Alternatively, maybe the 2H is part of a cyclopropane ring or something else. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, if the product is an epoxide, the NMR would show two protons as a triplet or something else, but the IR would show an epoxide's C-O stretch, which is usually around 1250 cm^-1. But the IR here shows 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, another reaction possibility: the Cleavage of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Since both Brs are on the adamantane structure, perhaps the KOH abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to the formation of two alkenes, but if they are not vicinal, that would not form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the compound undergoes a ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a diketone. So, if each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, that would form a 1,3-diketone. But the NMR doesn't show any carbonyl protons, because ketones don't have protons attached. So the NMR here shows 4.79 ppm as 2H. Maybe that's for some kind of CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol? But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base causes the formation of an enolate. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a product. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester, but that would have a carbonyl, but I don't see an ester group in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alcohol. But how? Unless the Br is replaced by OH. But that would require a substitution, and KOH is a base, not a nucleophile. Unless it's a double substitution, but that's unlikely without a good leaving group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but as the Brs are not adjacent, that wouldn't form a double bond. Unless it's a more complex structure where the Brs are in positions that allow for the formation of a ring. Wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so perhaps the elimination forms a bridge.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR data. The product 1 has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). What's a 10H multiplet in that region? That's probably the adamantyl group. Adamantane has a lot of CH groups, so a multiplet integrating to 10H makes sense. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to something else.

The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, maybe like an ether or a carbonyl. But the IR has 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the structure is a ketone where the CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone. But in that case, the CH2 wouldn't be there. Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-like reaction, but KOH isn't a Grignard reagent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane ring opening. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a vicinal diol, but that would require a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone and an epoxide? No, that doesn’t seem to fit either.

Wait, wait. Let me think about what 1,3-dibromoadamantane looks like. The structure is such that each Br is attached to a carbon that's part of a bridge. So perhaps when treated with KOH, it undergoes cleavage of each C-Br bond, and the base abstracts a proton to form a carbonyl group. So each Br would be replaced by a carbonyl, but wait, that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent to another Br, which they are not. Or perhaps the structure ends up with a single carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps one Br is eliminated as HBr, and the other remains, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. Let me imagine that when KOH is heated with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, it cleaves both C-Br bonds, and the two adjacent carbons (from each Br) form a carbonyl group. But for that, each C-Br must be adjacent to a carbon that can form a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps the adamantane structure allows for the formation of a bridge or a ring where the two carbons are connected, leading to a ring-opening and forming a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think about the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone. So the product after KOH is a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone derived from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

So, in the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 next to a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a structure like (CH2)CO. Wait, but a ketone would have a carbonyl, say R2C=O. If the CH2 is adjacent, maybe it's an acetyl group attached to an adamantyl structure.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like (adamantyl)COCH2. But then the 4.79 ppm would be the CH2 next to the carbonyl, and maybe a triplet due to coupling with adjacent protons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester, but that's less likely because KOH is a base, so more of a saponification would occur if it were an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone, like bicyclic where the bridge is opened to form a ketone. But I'm not entirely sure.

Okay, moving on to the next step. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps product 1 is treated in a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but ketones aren't typically used as acylating agents unless it's in an acylation reaction. Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's used in a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is reacting in some kind of ring-opening or cyclization. Wait, another possibility is that product 1 is a diol, but no, the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of rearrangement or ring expansion. Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation where product 1 acts as the alkylating agent. But product 1 is a ketone, which isn't a typical alkylating agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bromide, but no, because KOH was used, and KOH would deprotonate or eliminate, not leave Br.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a substituted cyclohexanone. Let me think. If product 1 is cyclohexanone, then heating with Al isopropoxide might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl group within the adamantane structure, making it a highly substituted ketone.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a quinone or some polycyclic ketone. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, undergoes some kind of cyclization. But I'm not clear on that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a aldol condensation. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes aldol addition to form a larger ring. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about what product 2 is, which then undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is used to break double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must contain a double bond.

Wait, so product 2 has a double bond. Then product 3 is the ozonolysis product. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically cleaves it and forms carbonyl groups. The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton, excluding those that exchange.

So, let's map this out:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH) → product 1 (ketone) → (Al isopropoxide) → product 2 (with a double bond) → ozonolysis → product 3.

So product 2 has a double bond, which upon ozonolysis forms carbonyl groups. So what type of double bond would product 2 have?

So, product 2 is likely an alkene. The reaction leading to product 2 from product 1 being treated with Al isopropoxide suggests a possible elimination reaction, perhaps. Because Al isopropoxide can act as a Lewis acid catalyst, promoting elimination.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol that is dehydrated. Wait, no. Wait, product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps product 2 is an enone, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Because in the presence of a Lewis acid, a ketone could undergo some kind of elimination to form an enone.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe product 1 is a geminal diol, but that's if it's a dihalide that underwent hydrolysis. But I thought product 1 is a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol that, upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, loses water to form an alkene.

Wait, maybe I got product 1 wrong. Let me reevaluate.

1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH at high temp. Let me think about dibromide reactions. When you have a dihalide, especially 1,3-dibromo, and you treat with a base, you might get a double elimination, leading to a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening of adamantane to form a ketone.

Wait, another thought: if two vicinal dihalides are present, but in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent. Wait, maybe the reaction is a reverse of a Diels-Alder? Or perhaps the base abstracts protons to form a diradical that leads to ring opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the adamantane structure. Oh, wait! I remember that when adamantane derivatives undergo cleavage with strong bases, they can form a ketone. For example, 1,3-dibromoadamantane might undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a diketone? But wait, in that case, the IR would show two carbonyl peaks, but the question says a characteristic absorbance, so maybe it's a single strong peak.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen, leading to a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single ketone. Let's imagine that the treatment with KOH leads to the formation of a ketone somewhere in the adamantane structure. Then product 1 is a ketone.

Then, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, used in Friedel-Crafts, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of enolate formation and elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, another reaction that forms alkenes is the elimination from an alcohol. But product 1 is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, could product 1 be an aldehyde? Then it would have a peak around 9-10 ppm, but the given NMR doesn't show that. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol. Wait, but the IR doesn't show an -OH stretch. The given IR only mentions 1720 cm^-1, which is the carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on what product 1 is. Let's think again. The 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 2.41-2.23 multiplet integrates to 10H, which must be the CH groups in the adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to something else. The 4.79 (2H) is maybe a CH2 attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. So maybe the structure is a cyclic ether with a ketone group. Alternatively, maybe it's a lactone. Wait, a lactone would have an ester group, which would show up around 1720 cm^-1. So if product 1 is a lactone, then the IR makes sense.

But how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a lactone with KOH? Lactones are cyclic esters, formed from hydroxy acids, but I don't see how two Brs would lead to that. Unless the base causes some kind of cyclization.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH induces a ring-opening of adamantane, leading to a diol, which then cyclizes to form a lactone. But that would require an acid catalyst, I think, not a base. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in a way that when KOH is added, it leads to a cyclic ether. Wait, but that doesn't fit the IR. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diethyl ketone or similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward, assuming product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by treating product 1 with Al isopropoxide, forming an alkene. Then, ozonolysis of
