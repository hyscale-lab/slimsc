Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem step by step. So, the question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending up with a product whose NMR we need to analyze. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these mechanisms, but let's think it through.

First, the initial reaction: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo elimination to form an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, which is a vicinal dihalide, this should form an alkene. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent carbons? Or maybe not. Wait, no, in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is connected to three others. So, 1,3-dibromo would actually be on adjacent positions in the structure. So elimination would form an alkene. The product would be an adamantylene or something similar.

The product 1 has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, wait a second. Elimination with KOH usually gives alkenes, but here the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh, maybe I was wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Wait, what else can happen with vicinal dihalides and KOH? Oh, wait, I think of the possibility of substitution. But KOH is a strong base; in a dihalide, perhaps it's a double elimination, but wait, no, elimination forms an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but that would require perhaps two substitutions. Wait, wait, no, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the starting material isn't a dihalide but something else? Or perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution. Wait, but in that case, if both bromides are replaced by hydroxide, we'd get a diol. But then, why the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹? That's more consistent with a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps the starting material, when heated with KOH, undergoes a double elimination. Vicinal dihalides can form alkenes upon elimination with a base. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules to form an alkene. That would result in an adamantylene, which is an alkene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the products. Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit either.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromides, substitution would require two equivalents of hydroxide. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane + 2 KOH would produce 1,3-diol. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think about the NMR data.

The NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 (2H), which is probably an OCH2 group. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H) which could be CH2 groups in the adamantane structure. And 1.94 (2H) maybe another CH2. Wait, but how does that fit with a diol? Diols would have OH groups, but if it's a diol, why is there no broad peak around 1-5 ppm for the OHs? Unless they are somehow exchanged or not showing up. Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ether, but that doesn't directly explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps instead of a substitution, it's an elimination followed by something else? Or perhaps the structure is such that the elimination gives a conjugated system with a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides react with a strong base, they eliminate to form alkenes. But in this case, the product has a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe the starting material is a geminal dihalide instead of a vicinal. No, the question says 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so they're on adjacent carbons. So that's vicinal. Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the base deprotonates something to form a carbonyl. Wait, if the dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination but with formation of a carbonyl group. Like in the case of the Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Alternatively, think about the possibility of forming a ketone via elimination. Wait, maybe it's an example of a dihalide converting into a ketone via a double elimination and oxidation? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide? No, that doesn't fit the IR. Wait, maybe the product is a diketone, which would explain the IR peak. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

Product 1's NMR: 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That could be an OCH2 group. Wait, but if it's an epoxide, the CH2 would be around 3.5-4.5 ppm. But 4.79 is a bit higher, but possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or an alcohol. But the IR has 1720, which is a carbonyl. Perhaps it's an ester, but how?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a double elimination with a rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the base isn't just eliminating but also deprotonating something else. Wait, could it be a pinacol-like rearrangement? The pinacol rearrangement involves the dehydration of a 1,2-diol to form a carbonyl. But in this case, we started with a dihalide, not a diol. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a substitution to form a diol, which then undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl? Let me think. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps the first step is substitution at each bromide, giving a diol. Then, under heating, the diol could undergo elimination to form a carbonyl. But for that, the diol would need to be vicinal (1,2 diol) to eliminate into a carbonyl. Wait, but in this case, the diol would be 1,3-diol if the starting material is 1,3-dibromo. So elimination from 1,3-diol would not form a carbonyl because the OHs are not adjacent. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't substitution but elimination to form an alkene, which then oxidizes. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless there's air present, but the question doesn't mention any oxidizing conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the initial reaction. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each carbon is bonded to three others. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. When KOH is added, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But the product would then be an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl group. So why the IR at 1720?

Wait, wait, maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen? If the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. But with Br on either side, perhaps a double elimination with oxidation? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution to form a hydroxyl group, but then another reaction occurs. Or maybe the product is an epoxide, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the initial product isn't the one with the carbonyl. Let me look at the next step. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, the product from KOH is product 1, which has a carbonyl. So product 2 would be after reaction with Al isopropoxide. Then, ozone is bubbled through a solution of 2, followed by dimethyl sulfide to form 3. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups.

Wait, so putting this together: Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, after KOH, we get product 1, which has a carbonyl (IR 1720). Then, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps leading to some acylium ion or something for a Friedel-Crafts type reaction. Then, ozonolysis is done on product 2 to form product 3.

Wait, but let me start over. Let me think about the first step again.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, excess. Vicinal dihalide elimination yields an alkene. So product 1 is an alkene, but then why the IR at 1720? Because alkenes don't have that. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another angle: the IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl, which is a ketone or ester. So product 1 must be a ketone. How does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone with KOH?

Another possibility: Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation with a neighboring group participation. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the two bromides are replaced by hydroxide, leading to a diol, and then elimination occurs to form a carbonyl. But for that, the diol would need to be 1,2-diol. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, substitution would give a 1,3-diol. Then, eliminating from a 1,3-diol would not form a carbonyl because the two OHs are on non-adjacent carbons. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a dihalide but a geminal dihalide. But the question says 1,3-dibromo, so that's not the case. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a Diels-Alder type reaction, but that requires a diene and a dienophile, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe KOH is acting as a base for an E2 elimination, forming a double bond, and then some other reaction occurs. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure of adamantane allows for a different kind of elimination, like forming a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally strained and not favored unless in specific structures.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. Epoxide formation typically involves a peracid, but KOH isn't a peracid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at product 1's NMR again. The peaks are 4.79 (2H, singlet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, multiplet), 1.94 (2H, singlet). The 4.79 is a singlet, which could be an OCH2 group. The 2.41-2.23 are probably CH2 groups in the adamantane structure, and 1.94 could be another CH2. If it's a diol, the singlet might be from two OH groups, but that usually appears as broad peaks, which aren't mentioned. Alternatively, the 4.79 could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether.

Wait, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Maybe product 1 is an ester. But how would that form from KOH and a dihalide? Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. So, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless there's an auto-oxidation, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a substitution of each bromide with an -O- group. But with KOH, substitution would give a diol. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit. So this is confusing.

Let me think about another possibility. Maybe the reaction is the formation of a carbonyl via the elimination of HBr twice, but in a way that forms a carbonyl. Wait, how? Let me imagine the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's like two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Upon elimination of two HBr, we might form a triple bond? No, triple bonds aren't common in adamantane derivatives. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can form a carbonyl via a mechanism involving the formation of a carbanion. But I'm not very clear on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a elimination followed by oxidation. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene, and then oxidation with something else. But the question states that KOH is the only reagent, so that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring, but that doesn't fit the IR data either.

Hmm. I'm stuck on the first step. Maybe I should move on and see if the subsequent steps can shed some light.

So, product 1 is treated with excess Al isopropoxide, forming product 2. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride, but that doesn't fit with the KOH reaction. Or perhaps product 1 has an ester group, which could undergo a Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl. So, if product 1 is an ester, then Al isopropoxide could catalyze a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's used in some other reaction.

Wait, but looking back, the IR of product 1 is at 1720 cm-¹, which is a strong carbonyl. Esters, ketones, and aldehydes have this. So, product 1 is probably a ketone or an ester.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide (a Lewis acid) could lead to some kind of enol formation or possibly a Friedel-Crafts reaction if there's an aromatic ring. But adamantane isn't aromatic, so that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, like enol formation, but I'm not sure how that would proceed to product 2.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, but then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, perhaps product 2 is formed by some kind of rearrangement. Or maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ether formed via a Williamson ether synthesis, but that would require an alkoxide and an alkyl halide, which doesn't fit the conditions.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction with Al isopropoxide is a dehydration, forming an alkene. But product 1 has a carbonyl; I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Let's suppose that product 1 is an ester, like O=C-O-R. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide could cause the ester to undergo some reaction. Or perhaps, the ester is acting as
