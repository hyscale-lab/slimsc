Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics, specifically about the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which set of assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation. The options are a combination of four statements, numbered 1 to 4, and the options are A to D, each selecting three of these statements.

First, I need to understand what the impulse approximation is. From what I recall, the impulse approximation is an approximation used in nuclear physics where the nucleons are treated as if they are free particles. This means that the interactions are considered to be so short-lived that the internal motions (like other nucleons moving around) can be neglected. So it's like each nucleon is hit by a 'short' interaction and moves on as a free particle, hence the term 'impulse'.

The question states that the approximation is made by supposing that nucleons behave as free nucleons. So the scenario is about when this approximation holds.

Now, the four assumptions are:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

I need to figure out which of these assumptions together lead to the impulse approximation.

Let me break down each statement.

Statement 1: Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So, the interaction doesn't involve any collective effects but acts on each nucleon separately. This seems like a key assumption because if the interaction is with individual particles, it's easier to treat them as free.

Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Hmm, what does transparent mean here? I think transparent implies that other nucleons don't contribute to the interaction. So, when a nucleon interacts (like via a force), the other nucleons don't affect the process. So the nucleus is mostly transparent, meaning the interaction is only felt by the one nucleon. That makes sense because if the nucleus is transparent, it's as if the other nucleons aren't there during the interaction. So this supports the idea of each nucleon acting independently, which fits the impulse approximation.

Statement 3: Quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, why does this matter? If quarks are non-relativistic, their motion is much slower, which probably means their kinetic energy is low. But how does that relate to the impulse approximation? The impulse approximation usually assumes that the interaction is so brief that the internal structure of the nucleon (like quark dynamics) doesn't affect the outcome. If the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe their interactions are more classical, but I'm not exactly sure how this directly relates to the approximation. This might not be a necessary condition for the impulse approximation itself. Alternatively, perhaps this is a condition that allows for a simpler treatment of the nucleon as a point particle without considering complex internal dynamics. But I'm a bit confused about this one.

Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. That makes sense because binding forces (like strong nuclear force holding nucleons together) would mean that when a nucleon is hit, it's affected by its neighbors. If we ignore these binding forces during the interaction, the nucleon can be treated as a free particle moving without any external influence beyond the impulse. So statement 4 supports the assumption that the nucleon acts freely.

So the question is, which combination of these statements implies the impulse approximation.

The impulse approximation requires that each nucleon's behavior can be approximated as free, so the interaction is treated as a short, impulsive force. Therefore, the key factors would be that the interaction only affects individual nucleons, the nucleus is transparent (so no other nucleons are involved), and there are no binding forces during the interaction. 

Let me think about each option:

Option A: 1,2,4. So statements 1,2,4.
