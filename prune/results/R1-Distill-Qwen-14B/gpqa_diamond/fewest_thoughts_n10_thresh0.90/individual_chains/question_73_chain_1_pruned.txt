Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about relativistic speeds and energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The questions are about their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition formula. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the values. So the first astronaut's speed is 0.6c, and the second's is 0.5c. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

So, v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² )

Wait, let me compute the numerator first. 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. 

Denominator: 1 minus (0.3c²)/(c²) which is 1 minus 0.3, so 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. That's looking like one of the options.

Now, about the total energy. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so I think I have to add their energies.

Energy in relativity is given by gamma * m c². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So that's about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says relative speed 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D is 0.14c and E=5mc², which is less. So option C matches the energy.

Wait, let me double-check the gamma calculations.

Gamma for 0.6c: (0.6)^2 is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. 1/0.8=1.25. Correct. So E1=2.5 mc².

Gamma for 0.5c: (0.5)^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)= about 0.8660. 1/0.8660 is around 1.1547. Right. So E2=3 *
