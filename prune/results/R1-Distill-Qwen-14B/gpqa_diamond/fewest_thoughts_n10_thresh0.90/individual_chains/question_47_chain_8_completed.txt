--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. That's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. The degree of unsaturation might help. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, which aren't here. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. So that's (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That breaks down into maybe a benzene ring (which is 3) plus a double bond or another ring, but probably a benzene ring and maybe an ester or amide group.

Now the IR data: the peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, both medium to strong. Those are likely N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Esters have around 1730-1750 cm-1, but maybe if it's conjugated, it could be lower. Amides are usually lower, like around 1650, but maybe if it's an amide with electron-withdrawing groups it could be higher. Or maybe it's an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so maybe the ethyl is attached to something else, like an oxygen. So if it's an ethyl group, maybe an ethoxy or an ester.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an -NH or an -OH group, but the molecular formula has O2 and N, so probably NH. But wait, the IR shows N-H, so maybe that's the amine. But wait, wait, the broad peak at ~4 ppm could be adjacent to an electronegative atom. If it's an N, maybe it's an amide. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group.

4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H. Quartet usually suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. So like OCH2CH2O or OCH2CH2... Wait, but in an ester, the structure is OCO-O-R. So for an ethyl ester, the structure would be OCO-OCH2CH3. But wait, the quartet is at 4.5, which is more deshielded than the ethyl group. So maybe the quartet is the OCH2 group in an ester.

Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet is probably the CH2CH3 group attached to an oxygen. So like OCH2CH3. The quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 connected to the carbonyl group. Wait, but in an ethyl ester, the structure is R-O-CO-O-R' or wait no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So if it's ethyl, the structure would be R-O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R' is an alkyl. So an ethyl ester would be O-CO-OCH2CH3. Hmm, so the ethyl group is OCH2CH3, which is split into a triplet because the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group. Wait, but in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would be at around 1.2 ppm as triplet, and the OCH2 (the one attached to the carbonyl) would be a quartet at about 4.1 or so, but in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, maybe it's not an ester then.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet is part of an amide structure. Wait, amides have a CONH2 or similar. But the quartet at 4.5 with 2H could be part of a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Let me think.

The other NMR signals: at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, doublets, 2H each. That looks like a para-substituted benzene. When you have two doublets in aromatic region, it's often a para substitution because each proton is next to two equivalent protons, leading to a doublet. So maybe the benzene has two substituents in para positions. 

So, putting it together, the molecule likely has a benzene ring with substituents, one of which is an ester or amide group, and another substituent which is an amino group or something else.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's break it down. Benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents would be 3 more carbons. If it's an ethyl group and another substituent, maybe. Let's think about each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (so a benzene ring with CONH2 at position 3, and ethoxy at position 3? No, wait, 3-ethoxy would be another substituent. Wait, benzamide is a benzene ring with a CONH2 group. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have an ethoxy group at the meta position relative to the amide. So substituents at 3 and 1 (if benzamide is at position 1?), but wait, the substituents would be at 3 and whatever.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. So N-substituted: the structure would be O=C(N-(4-ethoxyphenyl))NH2. Wait, not sure, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, formamide is RCONH2, so formamide with N-substituted would be R'NHCO-R". Wait, no, the structure for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be O=CN-(4-ethoxyphenyl) attached to something. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's O=CNH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 4-ethoxyphenyl attached to the nitrogen of a formamide.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be benzene with NH2 at position 4 and a propionoate group. So, it's an amino group and a propionate group in para positions. So the amino group would be on the benzene, and the propionate is the ester.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate is the benzene ring with a COO- group. So ethyl would make it an ester: the benzoate ester with ethyl as the R group. Plus, an amino group at position 4.

So, looking at the NMR data, let's think about each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene ring with a -O-CO-OCH2CH3 (wait, no: benzoate ester is O-CO-OEt, so benzene with O-CO-OEt at position 4, and amino group at position 4? Wait, no, 4-aminobenzoate would have amino at position 4 and the ester group at position 1? Or wait, the benzoic acid is at position 4? Wait, no, benzoate ester is when the COOEt is attached to the benzene. So if it's 4-aminobenzoate, the amino is in the para position relative to the COOEt group.

So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH2CH3
attached to benzene which also has an amino group at position 4.

Wait, but in that case, the amino group would be adjacent to the carbonyl? No, because in para substitution, the COOEt is at position 1, and amino at position 4, which is across. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

Looking at the NMR of option D:

The ethyl ester group would have the OCH2CH3 as triplet at ~1.2 ppm, which matches the data. The OCH2 (the one attached to carbonyl) would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3, but the data shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe the coupling is different. Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 is split into a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. 

Also, in the NMR, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Wait, that's a bit confusing. If it's an amino group, but amino as NH2 would typically show up as a broad peak around 2-5 ppm, but that's for the NH protons. Wait, but in the case of an amine, like an amide, the NH might be exchanging and appear as a broad peak. Alternatively, if the amine is in the para position, but in a structure like ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group would be -NH2 attached directly to the benzene.

But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Hmm, maybe that's not the amino group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an -OCH2- group adjacent to something else. Wait, perhaps it's a CH2N group. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, if the structure is 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester, then the ester part is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the OCH2CH3 would be triplet at ~1.2 ppm, which matches. Then the OCH2 attached to COO would be a quartet at ~4.1-4.3, but the data shows quartet at 4.5. Hmm, maybe the OCH2 is at 4.5. Alternatively, that could be because of some deshielding effect due to the adjacent carbonyl.

But the NMR also has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, 2H. What could that be? Maybe it's the NH2 group from the amino. Wait, amino protons in aromatic substitution typically show up as broad signals. For example, in aniline, the NH2 protons are usually around 5-6 ppm, but they can be broad. But in this case, the signal is at 4.0 ppm, which is a bit low for NH2. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the amino group is not directly attached but part of another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet and singlet are from different groups. Hmm.

Looking back at the IR data: strong band at 1720 cm-1. For an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720-1740. So that fits with an ester. So the compound has an ester group.

In the NMR, the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 in the ester. The triplet at 1.2 is the CH2CH3 in the ester. So that fits. So the ethyl ester part is correct.

Now, what about the other groups? The aromatic protons are two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. That suggests a para-substituted benzene. So the benzene has two substituents in para positions: one is the ester group (COOEt) and the other is something else, maybe an amino group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see for each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The formula of benzoate ester is C8H7O2 (benzoic acid is C7H6O2; when esterified with ethanol, it becomes C8H8O2? Wait, no. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When you esterify it with ethanol (C2H5OH), the ester would be C9H10O2. But wait, the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. So that's one more N and one more H. So D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because the benzoate ester is C8H8O2, but adding an NH2 group (which adds N and two H, but also replaces a H from the benzene). Let me check: the ester is (benzene-COOEt) plus NH2. Benzene is C6H5. COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3, which adds two O and (CH2CH3). So the benzoate part is C7H7O2 (since benzene has 6 carbons, COOEt adds one C from the carbonyl and two from the ethyl, but wait: benzene (6 C) + COOEt (COOCH2CH3 has 3 C: C from COO, and CH2CH3). So total is 6 + (1 + 2) = 9 C? Wait, COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3. So the ester group is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the benzoate is C6H5COOCH2CH3, which is C8H8O2. Adding an NH2 group (as in 4-aminobenzoate) would replace a H on the benzene with NH2. So the formula becomes C8H7NO2. Wait, but the compound in question is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, the molecular formula for D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C6H5COOCH2CH2NH2? No, wait, no. Wait, 4-aminobenzoic acid is C6H5NH2COOH. Its ester with ethanol would be C6H5NH2COOCH2CH3. So the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count: C: 6 (benzene) + 1 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) + 1 (NH2) no, wait, NH2 is part of the benzene substitution. So the formula is C6H5-CONH2 becomes C7H7N O2, but when esterified, it becomes C6H5-CO-OCH2CH3, which is C9H10O2. But wait, wait, the structure is C6H5-COOCH2CH3 with an NH2 group. So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Because the benzene (6C) + COOCH2CH3 (3C, O and O), and the NH2 adds one N and two H. So I think D is C9H11NO2.

But let's check the NMR of option D. The structure is benzene with NH2 at position 4 and COOEt at position 1. The aromatic protons would be two doublets: let's see, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, so the adjacent positions (2 and 6) would have protons, each as doublets. But wait, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite, so the ring would have protons in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, no, if substituents are at 1 and 4, then positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to substituent 1, and positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to substituent 4. But in a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are in positions 1 and 3? Wait, no, para is 1 and 4. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The two substituents are in 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). So the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOEt, and the protons in positions 3 and 5 would be meta. So what would their chemical shifts be?

In such a scenario, the protons ortho to the COOEt would be deshielded and appear upfield, while the protons meta to COOEt would be more shielded. Wait, or is it the other way around? Actually, substituents can have different effects. Electron-withdrawing groups like COOEt would deshield the ortho and para protons, causing them to appear downfield. But in this case, the NH2 is also a substituent, which is activating and donating electrons, which would affect the ring protons.

Alternatively, maybe the two doublets in the NMR are due to the two different sets of aromatic protons. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm could correspond to the protons ortho and para to the substituents. Wait, but in this structure, the substituents are at 1 and 4, so the protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. The protons at 3 and 5 are meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2.

Wait, but in the NMR, when you have two doublets, it suggests that each set of protons is only coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps the two substituents are in positions that create two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 3, then the protons would be in 2,4,5,6. But that's meta, not para substitution. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternative approach: look at the options and see which match the NMR data.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester group would be OCH2CH3 as triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5, which seems correct.

The amino group would be NH2 on the benzene. Would the NH protons show up in the NMR? In some cases, NH protons can be broad and appear around 5 ppm or so. But in the given NMR, at 4.0 ppm, there's a broad singlet of 2H. That doesn't quite fit with NH2 protons, which are usually higher (like 5-6 ppm). So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak isn't from NH2. If the structure is an amide, then the NH would be different. Wait, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Formamide is HCONH2. So if it's N-substituted, the structure would be R-NH-CO- something. Wait, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be O=CN-(4-ethoxyphenyl) with another group. Hmm, not exactly sure, but perhaps the structure is O=CH2N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). No, wait, formamide has the structure RCONH2. So if it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure would be (4-ethoxyphenyl)NH-CO- something. Wait, maybe it's (4-ethoxyphenyl)NH-CO-R, but R is probably a methyl group since it's formamide.

Wait, formamide is HCONH2, so N-phenyl formamide would be PhNH-CO-H. So N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be (4-ethoxyphenyl)NH-CO-H. So the structure is Ph-O-CH2CH3 attached to the N, and the formamide is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3.

In this structure, what would the NMR show? The ethoxy group would be a triplet at ~1.2 ppm, quartet around 4.5 (the OCH2). The formamide would have an NH group, which might show up as a broad peak. Also, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, as in para substitution.

But wait, in this case, the substituents on the benzene are the ethoxy and the NHCOH group. The NH would be part of the formamide, so the H's on NH would be in the NMR as a broad signal. But the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5, triplet at 1.2, and a broad singlet at 4.0.

Alternatively, maybe the quartet at 4.5 is from the ethoxy group's OCH2, the triplet from the CH2CH3, and the broad singlet at 4.0 is from the NH group.

But formamide's NH would typically be around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak, but maybe that's not the case here. Or perhaps it's an amide NH, which can be broad. Hmm.

But the IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which would be the carbonyl of the amide. Amide carbonyls are usually around 1650-1700, but sometimes higher. So that could fit.

But looking at the options again, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have an ester and an amino group.

Wait, going back to the NMR data: the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe that's the -NH2 group. But in aromatic amines, the NH2 protons are usually around 5-6 ppm, so 4.0 seems a bit low. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an N-linked CH2 group. Let's look at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: benzene with NH2 at position 4, and a propionate group (CH2CH2COO-) attached. So the propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the OCH2CH2COO- group.

In that case, the NMR would have the CH2CH2COO- group. The ethyl part (CH2CH2) would be split into different peaks. But the data has a quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2, which suggests an ethyl group attached via an oxygen. Like an ethoxy group. So maybe option C isn't the right fit, because propionate would be longer, perhaps leading to different splitting.

Alternatively, checking the 1H NMR of option C: the propionate would have a -CH2CH2COO- group. The OCH2 would be adjacent to another CH2, leading to a quartet, but at a different chemical shift. Maybe around 3.5-4.0 ppm? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is from the OCH2 of the ester. Then, the 4.0 ppm peak is from another group, like an amino group. But as I said earlier, the amino group's protons are usually higher upfield.

Wait, another thought: what if the 4.0 ppm peak is from an OCH2 group adjacent to an NH or something else. Or perhaps it's part of an amide.

Wait, option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is O=CH2-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). Wait, no, maybe O=CN-(4-ethoxyphenyl)CH3? Hmm, no. Let me restate: formamide is HCONH2. So N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would have the structure (4-ethoxyphenyl)NH-CO-H. So the carbonyl is at the formamide part, and the ethoxy is on the benzene.

So the NMR would have the ethoxy group's triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5. The formamide would have an NH, which could show up as a broad peak around 8 ppm. But the NMR has a peak at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet of 2H.

Hmm, maybe that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is from the NH2 group of the amino, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would make it C9H11NO3? Because benzamide is C7H7NO2, adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) adds O and two CH2 groups. Wait, no: 3-ethoxybenzamide would be C9H11NO3? Because benzamide is C7H7NO2: C6H5CONH2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would replace an H on the benzene ring. So the formula becomes C6H4(OCH2CH3)CONH2. The formula would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2, so that doesn't match. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. When N-substituted with 4-ethoxyphenyl, the structure is O=CH2-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). Wait, no. Formamide is RCONH2. So N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be (4-ethoxyphenyl)NH-CO-H. So the formula would be C6H5OCH2CH3 (from ethoxy) plus NHCOH. Let's count the carbons: benzene (6) + OCH2CH3 (2) + CO (1) + H (doesn't add C). So total is 6+3=9? Wait, OCH2CH3 is 2 carbons, the CO is one, so 6+3=9. So formula is C9H11NO2. Because: benzene (C6), ethoxy (C2), formamide (CO and H). Wait, the formamide is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the formula is C6H5-OCH2CH3 plus HCONH2. Wait, no, more accurately, the formula would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 plus NHCOH. So:

C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide CO) = 9.

H: benzene (5 H, since one replaced by OCH2CH3 and another by NHCOH) + ethoxy (5 H? Wait, no: OCH2CH3 has 2 CH2 groups, 2*2=4 H, plus the benzene's 5 H (since two substituents: OCH2CH3 and NHCOH). Wait, maybe it's easier to just count all H.

N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would have:

Ph-OCH2CH3 (C8H9O)

Plus HCONH- attached to Ph-OCH2CH3.

Wait, but HCONH- would add a CO and an NH. So total formula:

C: 6 (Ph) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 1 (CO) = 9.

H: Ph has 5 H (since two substituents), OCH2CH3 has 5 H (2 from OCH2, 2 from CH3, and the O is connected to Ph), formamide's HCONH would have 2 H (NH and the H from CO). Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Yes, because:

Ph-OCH2CH3 is C8H9O.

HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3 would be C9H11NO2. Because:

Ph-OCH2CH3: C8H9O.

Adding HCONH (which is HCONH2 minus the two H from NH2, but no, wait. HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3 would have:

C: 6 (Ph) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 2 (HCONH) = 6+2+2=10? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that option B's formula is C9H11NO2, so the option is possible.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is benzene with NH2 and COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-.

So the formula would be C6H5 (Ph) + NH2 + CH2CH2COO-. So C6 + 3 (propionate) + 1 (NH2) = C10? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, which is 3 carbons. So total C: 6 (Ph) + 3 (propionate) + 1 (from NH2, which is just N and H2) = 10? No, the formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, C6H5NH2 is C7H7N. Propionate is C3H5O2. Together, it's C7 + C3 = C10, which doesn't match. So maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is OCOCH2CH2CH3, which is 3 carbons. So the formula would be C6H5 (6 C) + OCO (2 O) + CH2CH2CH3 (3 C and 7 H). Wait, but the molecular formula is C9, so 6 + 3 =9. So yes, C9H11NO2. Because:

Ph (6 C) + OCOCH2CH2CH3 (3 C) =9 C. Also, one N from NH2.

So option C's formula is correct.

So, the options that fit the formula are B, C, and D.

Now, looking back at the 1H NMR:

At 4.0 ppm, a broad singlet of 2H. What could that be? If it's an NH, as in an amide or amine, but the chemical shift is a bit low. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an O or N.

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is Ph-COOEt with NH2 at position 4.

The NMR would show:

- OCH2CH3 triplet at 1.2 ppm.

- OCH2 (part of ester) quartet at ~4.5 ppm.

- Aromatic protons as two doublets.

But where would the NH2 protons appear? They might be broad, but around 5-6 ppm. The NMR has a peak at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't fit that.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm peak is from the NH2, but that seems unlikely.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure has an ethoxy group on the benzene and a formamide group attached to the N.

So in the NMR:

- OCH2CH3 triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5.

- The formamide's NH would be a broad peak, perhaps around 8 ppm. But the NMR doesn't show a peak that high.

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't include any peaks beyond 8 ppm except the aromatic ones.

Hmm.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure is PhNH2 with a propionate ester.

In the NMR, the propionate's OCH2CH2CH3 would have triplet(s) and quartet(s). But the given data has quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2, which are more like ethyl groups than propyl. So perhaps option C isn't the answer.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester part matches the triplet and quartet. The aromatic protons would be two doublets. So the NMR would show those. But the NH2's protons are unclear.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak isn't from NH2 but from an OCH2 group. But then, where would that OCH2 come from? Maybe it's part of an amide.

Wait, in option B, the structure is O=CH2-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). Wait, that can't be right. Formamide is HCONH2, so substituting the NH2 with a phenyl group would give O=CH-NH-Ph-OCH2CH3. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, N-substituted formamide would have the structure R-NH-CO-R'. Here, R' is H, and R is 4-ethoxyphenyl.

So the structure is (4-ethoxyphenyl)NH-CO-H. The NMR would show the ethoxy's triplet and quartet, and the formamide's NH would be a broad peak, perhaps around 8 ppm, but the data doesn't have that. Alternatively, maybe the NH is exchanging and not visible, but that's unlikely.

Wait, the NMR has a peak at 4.0 ppm, which is a broad singlet of 2H. If this is an NH group, perhaps it's part of an amide. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to draw the structures and see.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene with COOEt and NH2 groups para to each other.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets. The COOEt's OCH2CH3 would give a triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5. The NH2 would have protons, but their shift is unclear.

But the NMR shows a peak at 4.0 ppm, which is 2H, broad. If the NH2 is not showing up, maybe it's because of rapid exchange or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2 group, but the shift is downfield due to being adjacent to the ester. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from a CH2 group, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of signals in the NMR.

The NMR has:

1.20 (t, 3H)

4.0 (bs, 2H)

4.5 (q, 2H)

7.0 (d, 2H)

8.0 (d, 2H)

So five signals. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which would have how many unique protons? Let's see for each option.

For option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The ethyl group gives two signals: triplet and quartet.

The aromatic ring has four protons in two doublets (two each), so that's two signals.

The amino group would have two protons. So in the NMR, we would expect the amino protons as a broad peak. But the NMR only has five signals, so perhaps the amino protons are exchanging and not showing up, or are split into another peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the amino protons are de-shielded and appear in the aromatic region, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, but in the given NMR data, there are five signals. So if the structure is D, the ethyl ester contributes two signals, the aromatic contributes two, and the NH2 contributes one. That's five. So perhaps the NH2's protons are the broad singlet at 4.0.

But I thought NH2 protons are usually higher upfield. However, if the NH2 is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like the ester, it could deshield the NH2, causing the shift to be downfield. So maybe 4.0 ppm is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an OCH2 group. But in that case, the OCH2 would be part of another structure.

Hmm. Let me think about the IR again. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. That could be an ester or an amide. But in an amide, the carbonyl is usually lower, like 1650-1700. So 1720 is more ester-like.

So if it's an ester, then the 4.0 ppm peak is probably not from the NH2. Wait, but in the case of D, the NH2 is an amino group, so its protons would be expected in the NMR as a broad peak. But the data doesn't show a peak in the expected region. So maybe D is not correct.

Looking back, option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

In this case, the formamide has a carbonyl, which would explain the IR peak at 1720 (but wait, amide carbonyls are usually lower, so maybe that's not right). Alternatively, if it's an ester, then the 1720 is correct.

Wait, formamide is an amide, so the IR would have a strong peak around 1650, but the given data is 1720. So that's conflicting. So option B might not be correct.

Hmm.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

The carbonyl would be from the ester, so IR at 1720 fits. The propionate would have a longer chain, but the NMR shows a quartet and triplet consistent with ethyl. So perhaps option C isn't fitting.

Wait, but option C's structure would have a propionate group, which is OCOCH2CH2CH3. The NMR for the OCOCH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet at around 1.6 ppm (from the CH2CH2CH3) and a quartet around 3.5 ppm (from the OCH2). But the given data has quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2, which doesn't match. So option C's structure doesn't fit the NMR.

So, perhaps the correct option is D, even though the NH2 protons don't quite fit.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm peak is not the NH2 but something else.

Wait, another thought: the structure could be an ethyl ester with an amino group adjacent to the ester. Let me think about option D's structure. The ethyl ester is OCOOCH2CH3, and the amino group is in the para position. The amino group is NH2 attached to benzene, which is in the para position to the ester.

So, the aromatic protons would be at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, as doublets.

The OCH2CH3 triplet at 1.2.

The OCH2 quartet at 4.5.

What about the NH2 protons? They would likely be a broad peak. But the NMR doesn't have a peak in the 5-6 ppm region, except the aromatic protons.

Wait, the NMR has a peak at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe that's the NH2, but shifted down. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not present and it's another group.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach: the integration of the NMR.

The triplet at 1.2 is 3H, which fits an ethyl group.

The quartet at 4.5 is 2H.

The broad singlet at 4.0 is 2H.

The aromatic protons are 4H in total: 2H each at 7.0 and 8.0.

So the total H is 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 =11 H. Which matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2.

So all signals are accounted for.

Now, what about the 4.0 ppm peak? It's 2H, broad. That suggests it's either an NH2 or an OCH2 or similar.

In the case of option D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene. So the NH2 protons would be in the NMR as a broad peak. But where? If the NH2 is para to the ester, perhaps the deshielding effect brings the shift down. But usually, aromatic amines are around 5-6 ppm. 

Another possibility: the 4.0 ppm peak is not from NH2 but from an OCH2 group. But in that case, the OCH2 would be part of another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is not D but another option.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-aminophenyl acetate. But that's not one of the options.

Another angle: the 4.0 ppm peak could be an -OCH2- group in a different environment. Like maybe a CH2N group.

Wait, option B has a formamide. So the structure is O=CNH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). The NH would be adjacent to the carbonyl, so the protons would be deshielded. The NH would be a broad peak, possibly around 8 ppm, but the data doesn't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH is exchanging and doesn't appear, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let's try to match each option with the NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Ester group: OCH2CH3 (triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5).

Aromatic protons: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0.

NH2 protons: broad peak, perhaps at 4.0 ppm (but I'm not sure about the shift).

But the molecular formula fits, and the ester's peaks match.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Ester: OCH2CH3 triplet and quartet.

Formamide: carbonyl at 1720 (but maybe that's too high for an amide; more likely for ester).

Aromatic protons: two doublets.

NH: broad peak, perhaps at 4.0 ppm, but not sure.

But the IR suggests a carbonyl around 1720, which fits more with an ester than an amide. So option B is less likely.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Ester group would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. The NMR would have peaks from the propyl group, but the given data has ethyl-like peaks. So option C doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct answer is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

But then, the NH2 protons would need to be accounted for in the NMR. The NMR doesn't show a peak in the expected region, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 protons are not visible because they're exchanging rapidly or because of the splitting.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, the amino protons can be broad and appear downfield, but perhaps in this case, they're integrated into the 4.0 ppm singlet. Maybe the 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2, and that's it. So with that, the answer would be D.


To identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data, the following analysis was conducted:

### Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation
The molecular formula C9H11NO2 corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 5, which suggests the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees of unsaturation) and additional unsaturation (likely from a carbonyl group).

### IR Data
- **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These are indicative of N-H stretching, likely from an amine or amide group.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This is characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.

### ¹H NMR Data
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, consistent with a CH2CH3 group, likely part of an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, possibly from an NH2 group or another group involving protons near an electronegative atom.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, consistent with an OCH2 group adjacent to a CH2CH3 group.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.
