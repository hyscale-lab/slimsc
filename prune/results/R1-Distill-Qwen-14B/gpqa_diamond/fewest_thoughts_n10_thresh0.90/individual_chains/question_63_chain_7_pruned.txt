Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Let's see, the question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. Hmm, I remember that in such models, molecules have both rotational and vibrational energy states.

First, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think means it's in the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So, for vibration, the fundamental state is the first vibrational level, n=0. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh right, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational states are quantized with quantum number J, and the vibrational states with n. But in this case, the model is the rotation-vibration model, so the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is a bit more complicated, but maybe for this problem, it's sufficient to think about the transition. If the molecule is currently in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0?), then the next possible state with the lowest energy would probably involve changing the vibrational state because raising J might lead to higher energy than a vibrational change.

Wait, no. Actually, the ground state for a diatomic molecule is typically the lowest vibrational level (n=0) and the lowest rotational level (J=0). So the fundamental state is n=0, J=0. To get to the next lowest energy state, the molecule could either increase its rotational level (J=1) or increase its vibrational level (n=1). But which transition requires less energy? Because the question is about the photon's momentum, which relates to the energy of the photon.

I remember that vibrational energy levels have a larger spacing compared to rotational ones. So the energy needed to go from n=0 to n=1 is higher than going from J=0 to J=1. So if the molecule absorbs a photon that causes it to increase its vibrational state, that would require more energy. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, maybe it's the next state after the fundamental, which could be either a rotation or vibration change, whichever is lower.

Wait, let me think. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J (J+1), where I is the moment of inertia, and J is the rotational quantum number. For vibration, the energy is E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w n, where n is the vibrational quantum number. Since the spacing between rotational levels is smaller, the transition from J=0 to J=1 would require less energy than from n=0 to n=1.

So, the photon would need to supply the energy difference between the current state (n=0, J=0) and the next possible state, which would be either (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0). Which one has a lower energy difference?

Let me compute both.

First, let's calculate the rotational energy difference. For J=0 to J=1. The energy for J=0 is E0 = (ħ² / (2I)) * 0*(0+1) = 0. For J=1, E1 = (ħ² / (2I)) *1*2 = (ħ²)(2)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So delta E_rot = E1 - E0 = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but the moment of inertia I is calculated as I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but I need to convert this into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605 = approx 3.019. So 3.019e-27 kg.

Bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = (3.019e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is h/(2π). h is approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (6.626e-34 / (2π))². Let's compute that.

First, 2π is approximately 6.2832. So, ħ ≈ 6.626e-34 / 6.2832 ≈ 1.055e-33 J s.

So ħ² ≈ (1.055e-33)^2 ≈ 1.113e-66 J² s².

Now, delta E_rot = ħ² / I = 1.113e-66 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ approx 9.21e-21 J.

Wait, that's a rough calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the rotational constant B. Oh wait, B is usually given by ħ²/(2I), but wait, actually the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I).

So, for J=0 to J=1, delta E_rot = B (2 - 0) = 2B.

Wait, no, because E_J=0 is 0, and E_J=1 is B*(1)*(2)= 2B. So delta E_rot is 2B.

What's B? Let's compute B.

B = ħ²/(2I).

We already have I = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

So ħ² = (1.055e-33)^2 = approx 1.113e-66 J² s².

So B = 1.113e-66 / (2 * 1.2076e-46) = 1.113e-66 / (2.415e-46) ≈ 4.61e-21 J.

So delta E_rot = 2B ≈ 9.22e-21 J.

Now, the vibrational energy transition from n=0 to n=1. The energy spacing is h*w, because the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) h w. So the difference between n=0 and n=1 is (1.5 h w) - (0.5 h w) )= h w.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So delta E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Wait, so comparing the two, delta E_rot is approximately 9.22e-21 J, delta E_vib is 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule can make a transition from J=0 to J=1 with a photon of energy 9.22e-21 J.

But wait, the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy. So after the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), the next state with the lowest energy would be either (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0), whichever is lower in energy. Because J=1 gives higher energy than n=1? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me think. The energy for J=1 is E_rot = 2B ≈ 9.22e-21 J. The energy for n=1 is delta E_vib = h w ≈2.65e-19 J. So 9.22e-21 is less than 2.65e-19. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon that causes it to go to the next rotational state rather than the vibrational one, since that's a lower energy requirement.

Therefore, the photon should supply the energy difference of 9.22e-21 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. The energy of a photon is E_photon = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. So p = E_photon / c.

So p = (9.22e-21 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-29 kg m/s. Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Wait, the options are in Ns. Oh, since 1 N = 1 kg m/s², and 1 Ns = kg m/s. So p in Ns is kg m/s.

Wait, so 3.07e-29 kg m/s = 3.07e-29 Ns. Looking at the options:

Option D: 1.4e-28 Ns → wait, 3e-29 is about 0.3e-28. None of the options are that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the calculations more carefully.

First, calculate the reduced mass μ. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

μ = 1.81818 * 1.66054e-27 kg ≈ let's compute:

1.81818 * 1.66054 ≈ 3.0185e0 → 3.0185e-27 kg.

Bond length r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.0185e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0185e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2074e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is h/(2π) = 6.62607015e-34 J·s / (2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-33 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-33)^2 = approx 1.1122e-66 J² s².

Rotational constant B = ħ²/(2I) → 1.1122e-66 / (2 * 1.2074e-46) = 1.1122e-66 / 2.4148e-46 ≈ 4.606e-21 J.

So delta E_rot for J=0 → J=1 is 2B = 9.212e-21 J.

Now, energy of the photon is E = 9.212e-21 J.

Photon momentum p = E / c. c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.212e-21 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.212e-21) / (3e8) = 3.07e-29 kg m/s.

Convert kg m/s to Ns (since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s), so p ≈3.07e-29 Ns.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 → 19e-29

B) 2.3e-27 → 230e-29

C) 1.1e-27 →110e-29

D)1.4e-28 →14e-29

Hmm, my calculation gives ~3.07e-29 Ns, which is about 3e-29. The closest option is D)1.4e-28, which is much larger. So maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the energy difference. Let me reconsider.

Wait, wait, perhaps the next state with the lowest possible energy is not the rotational transition but vibrational. Because the question may be considering the fundamental state as the lowest vibrational state (n=0, J=0). The next state could be when the molecule absorbs a photon that causes it to go to the next vibrational level (n=1, J=0), which would involve a larger energy jump but perhaps that's the only allowed transition.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, transitions between rotational states are allowed when delta J = ±2, but for rotation-vibration coupling, the selection rules might allow delta J = ±1 along with delta n = ±1. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Wait, the question says the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model). So perhaps it's considering transitions that involve both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, perhaps the molecule could absorb a photon that causes a transition to a higher vibrational state without changing the rotational state. Because that would make the energy jump higher than the rotational one, but perhaps that's the only way to get the next state. Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would imply the minimal energy increase.

So, if the molecule is in n=0, J=0, the next possible state with the lowest energy would be J=1, n=0 because the energy increase is smaller than going to n=1, J=0.

But according to my earlier calculation, the required photon momentum is about 3e-29 Ns, which doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made an error in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be either J=1 or n=1. But if the molecule is to go to the next state with the lowest possible energy, it's the one that requires the least energy. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is 2B, which gives a momentum of E/(c) = 2B/(c).

Wait, let me recalculate B more accurately.

I think I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

B = ħ²/(2I)

We have:

ħ² = (1.0545718e-33 J s)^2 = 1.1122e-66 J² s².

I = 1.2074e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.1122e-66 / (2 * 1.2074e-46) = 1.1122e-66 / 2.4148e-46 ≈ 4.606e-21 J.

So 2B = 9.212e-21 J.

E_photon = 9.212e-21 J.

p_photon = E/c = 9.212e-21 / 3e8 = 3.07e-29 kg m/s = 3.07e-29 Ns.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe the question is about the transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the next state, which is the first excited state which is vibrationally excited (n=1, J=0), because the energy difference is larger but it's the next state in the overall hierarchy.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the order. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state in energy could be either the first rotational state (J=1, n=0) or the first vibrational state (n=1, J=0). Which one has lower energy?

We can compute both.

E_rot for J=1, n=0: E_rot = 2B ≈9.21e-21 J.

E_vib for n=1, J=0: E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So 9.21e-21 J is 0.9% of 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is J=1, n=0.

So the photon must provide 9.21e-21 J.

p = E/c = (9.21e-21 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.21e-21) / (3e8) = 3.07e-29 kg m/s.

Convert to Ns: 3.07e-29 Ns. None of the options match this. Wait, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, B = ħ²/(2I) → but wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1 sometimes, but here we're using J in terms of energy in Joules. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia differently.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute the rotational energy difference and then the photon's momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0), which would require the photon energy of h*w.

Wait, but that would be a much larger energy jump. Earlier calculation gave that as 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger than the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the molecule to transition to the next state which is a combination of rotation and vibration, like a change in both. But that would be a higher energy than either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let's recalculate B.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recalculate I.

I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = approx (1.81818 * 1.6605) e-27.

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's calculate:

1.8 * 1.6605 = approx 2.9889, and 0.01818 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.029999. So total ≈3.0189e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.0189e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0189e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20756e-46 kg m².

So that's correct.

Then, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-33)^2 / (2 * 1.20756e-46) → 1.112e-66 / 2.415e-46 ≈ 4.605e-21 J.

Wait, so 2B is 9.21e-21 J.

Hmm. So the photon's energy is 9.21e-21 J.

p = E/(c) = 9.21e-21 / 3e8 = 3.07e-29 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns (which is 14e-29), which is about 4.5 times larger than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let's double-check.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the moment of inertia is different? Oh wait, another possibility: the bond length is given as 2 angstroms. So r=2e-10 m. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the model expects the transition to the next state as the first vibrational state, not the rotational. Because perhaps the question is considering the 'fundamental state' as the lowest vibrational state, and the 'next state' as the first vibrational excited state, not considering rotation. But that would require a higher energy.

But the problem states it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so both are considered. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first state, which could be the next state in terms of the combined rotational and vibrational energy. So maybe the next state is (v=1, J=0), which has higher energy than (v=0, J=1). So in that case, the photon would need to have the energy to promote to the vibrational state.

But that would require a photon with momentum much higher than our earlier calculation. Let me compute that.

Energy for vibrational transition is h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is close but not exactly.

Wait, but then why the discrepancy? Let me check if I'm using the correct values.

Wait, maybe
