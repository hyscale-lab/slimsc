Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think aloud.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Hmm, wait, so all have the same charge? But 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system.

Wait, energy in this context would probably be the potential energy, right? Because when charges are arranged in space, their potential energy contributes to the system's total energy. Since the system is isolated, I think kinetic energy isn't a factor here because the particles are either fixed or constrained, so they aren't moving. Or maybe the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is all that's considered.

So the setup is: there's a central charge (13th) fixed at point P, and 12 charges each at 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. So all 12 are at the same distance from P but are constrained to stay there.

Wait, but how are the 12 charges arranged around P? Are they all on the same point? No, that can't be because then they'd be at the same point, causing infinite repulsion. So more likely, they're placed symmetrically around P. Like on a sphere with radius 2m.

But wait, wait. The question says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each is at a distance of 2m, but their exact positions on the sphere don't matter for the potential energy calculation as the problem might assume that the potential energy is solely due to the central charge and the other charges. Hmm, or perhaps it's about the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, plus the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, potential energy in a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies between each pair. So U = (1/(4πε₀)) * Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij) for all i < j.

In this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance r=2m from the central charge. Also, the 12 charges are each 2m from P, but what about their mutual distances? Are they all at 2m from each other? No, that's not necessarily true. But wait, the problem says "constrained to stay at 2m from a point P"—so each is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary, but perhaps the minimum energy occurs when they are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies are minimized. Wait, but for identical charges, like charges repel. So to minimize the potential energy, the charges should be as far apart as possible from each other. Because potential energy between two positive charges is positive and increases with distance. Wait, no, wait: for two positive charges, the
