Okay, so I need to figure out what Compound X is and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start by analyzing the given spectral data.

First, looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch. But wait, that's a broad region, so maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Now, 1720 can correspond to either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Oh, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be even broader and maybe around 2500-3000. But the IR shows a peak in the 3400â€“2500 region, which could be multiple things. Also, there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe the compound has an aromatic ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But also, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, but they are usually broad because of the exchange with water. But the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde? Or maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Also, the next peak is at 8.0 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That might be aromatic protons. The 7.2 ppm as a doublet (2H) also suggests an aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted because the doublets could be two sets of equivalent protons. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene.

Looking further, the NMR shows a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That could be a methine (CH) group attached to something else. Then there's 1.7 ppm (m
