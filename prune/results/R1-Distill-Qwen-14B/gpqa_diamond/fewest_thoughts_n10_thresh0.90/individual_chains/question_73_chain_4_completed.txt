Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities normally. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Let me think. Oh yeah, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, we subtract the smaller velocity from the larger one.

So for the relative velocity, v_rel. Let me plug in the numbers. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) ). Let me compute that.

First, numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. That would match options C and D.

Now, for the total energy. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma*m*c². So I'll need to calculate gamma for each.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute each.

First astronaut: v=0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36. 1-0.36=0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is gamma * m * c². Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. Square root is about 0.8660. Gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. Mass is 3m, so E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Wait, wait. Let me double-check those calculations.

E1: 0.6c. So gamma for 0.6c is 1.25, right? Because (0.6)^2 is 0.36, so 1/(sqrt(0.64))=1.25. So 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 m c².

E2: 0.5c. Let's compute gamma again. 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2)) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Sqrt of 0.75 is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 = 3.464 m c².

Wait, but wait, 1.1547 times 3 is actually 3.464, right? So E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and D says E=5 mc². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c and energy is 5.96 mc². That matches option C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C says v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc². That's correct.

Wait, but another thought: energy is for each astronaut. So the total energy is the sum of their individual energies. Yes, that's what I did.

Hmm, any possibility I made a mistake in calculating the velocities? Let's see. The relative speed formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So 0.6c and 0.5c. So (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1428c, which is ~0.14c. Correct.

So the correct option is C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \(2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \(3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2\)

#### Total Energy:
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). This matches option **C**.
