Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of two planets relate based on the spectral line shifts observed. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, so both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The RV method detects these planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble.

The key data here are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i) / (1 + (M_p/M_*)), where M_p is the planet's mass and M_* the star's mass. But since both stars are solar mass and the planets are similar to Neptune, the (M_p/M_*) term is small, so sin i is approximately 1 (assuming edge-on orbits, which is the case for maximum RV signal). So K is proportional to v, the velocity of the star's orbit around the barycenter.

Wait, but how does this velocity relate to the orbital period? Oh, right, the velocity amplitude K is given by (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)/( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) * c)), where c is the speed of light. But perhaps there's a simpler way to think about it.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because K scales with (P)^(-1/3). So if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, let me get that right. Because K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy here. Maybe another approach.

Wait, the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. So if the star is moving faster, the shift is larger. So if Planet #1 causes a 5 mA shift and Planet #2 causes a 7 mA shift, then the star for Planet #2 is moving faster than that of Planet #1.

So K2 = (7 mA) / (5 mA) * K1 = 7/5 * K1. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_*^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ) or something like that. Since the planets have similar masses (Neptune), and the stars are same mass, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → (since K2 > K1, P2 < P1)

Wait, let me think again. The formula for K is K ≈ (v star) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Since M_p << M_*, denominator is approx (M_*)^(2/3) P^(1/3). So K ≈ (constant) * M_p / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p and M_* are same for both planets, K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). So K is inversely proportional to cube root of period.

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We know K2 is 7/5 of K1. So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3.

Calculating (5/7)^3: 5³=125, 7³=343 → 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times, so it's shorter, not longer. So wait, did I get this the right way around?

Wait, the question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1? If P2 is 0.36 P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the answer would be that P2's period is 0.36 times that of P1. But the options are about how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then the factor is less than 1. But looking back at the options:

Wait, the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the question is, how many times is P2 longer than P1? If P2 is shorter, then it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be A) ~0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then higher K implies shorter period.

So, K2 is larger than K1 → P2 is shorter than P1. So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me re-derive this:

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

So, if K2 = (7/5) K1, then P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

K1/K2 = 5/7 → (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = 0.364 * P1 → P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be 0.36 times, so P2 is shorter. So the period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1, meaning P2 is shorter. So the question is asking for P2's period compared to P1, so the factor is 0.36, option A.

Wait, but in the options, option A is ~0.36, which would be correct.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). This implies that \( P \propto K^{-3} \).

Given that the RV shifts for planet #1 and planet #2 are 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Since \( P \propto K^{-3} \), the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is **shorter** than planet #1's, and the factor by which it is shorter is approximately 0.36.

The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since planet #2's period is shorter, the factor is less than 1, and the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
