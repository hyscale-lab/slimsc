Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me think through it. The question is about a peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR is mostly as expected, except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Hmm, but wait, why would there be two peaks for the same proton?

The NMR peaks have similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. So each is about half a proton? And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not like they're splitting each other. What else could cause multiple peaks for the same proton?

Looking at the options: Option A is a precursor contamination. But if that were the case, I think the mass would be different. The LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass as expected, so it's not a different compound. So probably not A.

Option B is enantiomers. Enantiomers would have the same NMR shifts because they're mirror images. But wait, in the case of chiral compounds, if the sample isn't pure, and you have enantiomers, the NMR might show different peaks only if the environment around the proton is different. Wait, but if the compound is a racemic mixture, the alpha proton would have the same environment, so their NMR peaks would overlap, right? Or wait, maybe if the coupling is with another chiral center, but the question says coupling pattern rules out spin-spin. So maybe B is not the issue. Or wait, if the sample is a racemic mixture, but the same molecule has multiple stereocenters, could that cause the splitting? Not sure yet.

Option C is double coupling during amide bond formation. Hmm, I'm not too familiar, but I remember that sometimes when forming amides, especially in peptide synthesis, you can get some side reactions or maybe some double couplings, leading to more than one product. Wait, but how would that affect NMR? If there are two diastereomers, their NMR peaks might split. Or maybe it's about the coupling in the amide bond. Alternatively, I'm not certain about this option.

Option D is a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. If the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, their NMR peaks would be split. But wait, why would the same alpha proton have two peaks? Let's think: each diastereomer would have the same shift for that proton, right? Or maybe the environment is slightly different. Wait, no. For example, if the alpha carbon is adjacent to a stereocenter, say, in a peptide bond, then changing the configuration could cause the alpha proton's shift to change. So if two diastereomers are present, each would have their own shift for the alpha proton. But the problem says the two peaks have similar shifts. So if they're diastereomers, their shifts might be similar but not identical. But wait, they could be close enough, maybe. But why would the integrals add up to 1H?

Wait, the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, which together make 1H. So each is integrating to about 0.5H. So perhaps the same proton is split into two due to coupling with another proton. But the question rules out spin-spin coupling, so that can't be it.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound is a racemic mixture but with an internal plane of symmetry. No, that wouldn't cause split peaks for the same proton. Or maybe it's some kind of tautomerism or conformer issue? But the shifts would probably be a bit different.

Wait, back to the options. The LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So it's two different compounds with the same molecular weight. But wait, same mass? Or same mass? Or same m/z? Oh, the question says same mass spectrum. So same molecular weight. But the same molecular formula? So perhaps it's a diastereomer or an enantiomer.

But the options are B and D. Enantiomers would have same molecular weight but same mass spectrum, but in the NMR, same shifts. But the NMR shows two separate peaks. Wait, but if it's a racemic mixture, then the NMR would show a singlet for an alpha proton because the environments are identical for both enantiomers. So that can't be.

Alternatively, diastereomers have different NMR shifts. So if you have more than one diastereomer, each would have their own shift for the alpha proton. So two peaks with similar shifts would make sense if they're diastereomers.

But the same molecular weight. So the molecular formula is same, but structure is different. So diastereomers would fit this scenario.

Wait, but in the NMR, each peak is integrating to about 0.5H. So maybe each diastereomer has an alpha proton, but in each, the alpha proton is split into two? No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the diastereomers are in a 1:1 ratio, each with a single alpha proton, but their shifts are so close that they appear as two peaks each integrating to 0.5H. If the two diastereomers have alpha protons with almost the same shift, their NMR peaks would be close but separate. So that could explain the two peaks adding up to 1H.

But wait, the NMR is showing two peaks for the same alpha proton. So perhaps each diastereomer has the same alpha proton environment. No, diastereomers have different physical properties, so their alpha protons would be in different environments, leading to different shifts. But in the question, the two NMR peaks have similar shifts. So maybe the diastereomers have similar shifts, but not identical.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is
