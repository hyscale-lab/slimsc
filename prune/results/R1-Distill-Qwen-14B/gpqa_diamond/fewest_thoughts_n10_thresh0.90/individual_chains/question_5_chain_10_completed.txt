Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully and figure out what I need to do. So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the states with definite values. The operator here is P, which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. 

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But the direction we're considering is an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, so n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, which means it makes some angle θ with the z-axis, and phi would be 0 since it's in the x-z plane. So n is like (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle.

But wait, the operator we need to consider is the component of P along this direction n. So the operator along n would be P · n. So that would be (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ) because the y-component of n is zero here.

Wait, or maybe it's better to express the operator as (P · n), which would be the sum of each P component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. Since n is in x-z plane, its y-component is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute. So the operator becomes P · n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

But wait, I'm supposed to find the eigenvector of the operator P along n. So I need to find the eigenvectors of the operator (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ). The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Right, so the approach is:

1. Construct the matrix representation of the operator P · n.
2. Find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
3. Since the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, find the corresponding eigenvector and normalize it.

Let me start by writing down each component matrix. 

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], but since n is in the x-z plane, the P_y term doesn't contribute because the n's y-component is zero. So the operator P · n is P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ.

Wait, let's compute P · n. So:

P · n = (P_x * sinθ) + (P_z * cosθ)
= (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix elements.

First, the matrix for sinθ * P_x:
sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ*(ħ/2)], [sinθ*(ħ/2), 0]]

The matrix for cosθ * P_z:
cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ*(ħ/2), 0], [0, -cosθ*(ħ/2)]]

Adding these two matrices:
[[cosθ*(ħ/2), sinθ*(ħ/2)], 
 [sinθ*(ħ/2), -cosθ*(ħ/2)]]

So the matrix representation of the operator P · n is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ , -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2.

The characteristic equation is det( (P·n) - λ I ) = 0.

So substitute the matrix:

( (ħ/2 cosθ) - λ ) * ( (-ħ/2 cosθ) - λ )  - ( (ħ/2 sinθ ) )^2 = 0

Wait, let me write the matrix (P·n) - λ I:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ - λ ), (ħ/2 sinθ ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ ), ( - ħ/2 cosθ - λ ) ]

The determinant is:

(ħ/2 cosθ - λ)(-ħ/2 cosθ - λ) - (ħ/2 sinθ)^2 = 0

Expand the first product:

= [ ( - (ħ/2 cosθ)^2 - λ (ħ/2 cosθ ) + λ (ħ/2 cosθ ) + λ^2 ) ] - ( (ħ/2 sinθ)^2 ) = 0

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute it step by step.

Multiply (ħ/2 cosθ - λ)(-ħ/2 cosθ - λ) = (- (ħ/2 cosθ)^2 ) - λ (ħ/2 cosθ ) + λ (ħ/2 cosθ ) + λ^2.

Wait, that's:

= (- (ħ^2/4 cos²θ )) + λ^2 + [ terms that cancel ]

Because the middle terms: -λ (ħ/2 cosθ ) + λ (ħ/2 cosθ ) = 0.

So the product becomes λ^2 - (ħ^2/4) cos²θ.

Then subtract ( (ħ/2 sinθ ) )^2:

So the equation becomes:

[λ^2 - (ħ^2/4) cos²θ ] - (ħ^2/4) sin²θ = 0

Simplify:

λ^2 - (ħ^2/4)(cos²θ + sin²θ ) = 0

Since cos²θ + sin²θ =1, this simplifies to:

λ^2 - (ħ^2/4 ) = 0

So λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

Which makes sense because the eigenvalues of spin operators are ± ħ/2.

We are looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, so we plug λ= ħ/2 into the equation. Now, we find the eigenvector.

The eigenvector equation is (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ), (ħ/2 sinθ ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ ), ( - ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ) ]

Factor out ħ/2:

[ ħ/2 (cosθ -1 ), ħ/2 sinθ ]
[ ħ/2 sinθ, ħ/2 (-cosθ -1 ) ]

Which simplifies the matrix to (dividing by ħ/2, which doesn't affect the null space):

[ (cosθ -1 ), sinθ ]
[ sinθ, (-cosθ -1 ) ]

So the system of equations is:

(cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1 ) b = 0

We can write the first equation as:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Alternatively, let's factor out:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Hmm, perhaps using some trigonometric identities could simplify this.

I remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting:

a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) ] = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] = cot(θ/2 )

So a = cot(θ/2) b → a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b → a = [ cos(θ/2) ] [ 1 / sin(θ/2) ] b

So the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2), which can be written as (cos(θ/2) ) / ( sin(θ/2) )

So the eigenvector can be written as:

[ a, b ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by a normalization factor. Wait, but let's check.

Wait, let me think again. From a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Wait, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(theta/2).

So a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] * b = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b.

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

So we can express the eigenvector as [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ] multiplied by some scalar.

But since eigenvectors are only defined up to a scalar multiple, we can write the vector as proportional to [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ].

But let me think about the components. Let me let b = 1, then a = cot(theta/2 ). So the vector is (cot(theta/2 ), 1).

But this can be rewritten in terms of sin and cos. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find a more symmetric representation. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of exponential form?

Wait, I think I might have made a miscalculation. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The eigenvectors of the spin operator along any direction are given by the spin-up and spin-down states in that direction. The eigenvectors can be written in terms of the eigenstates of the z-component, which are |↑⟩ = [1, 0] and |↓⟩ = [0, 1].

The general eigenstate can be written as a superposition of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue, the state is a combination that depends on the direction n.

In the case where the direction is along the z-axis, the eigenvector is [1, 0]. When it's along x, it's [1, 1]/√2. So for an arbitrary direction, it's a combination of these.

Wait, the eigenvector can be written as:

|+⟩ = cos(theta/2) |↑⟩ + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓⟩

But in this problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi = 0.

So phi is zero, so the |+⟩ state becomes cos(theta/2) |↑⟩ + sin(theta/2) |↓⟩.

So the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait, let's consider the direction n in the x-z plane. So the state for spin-up along n would have components in x and z. So indeed, the eigenvector should be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the elements of the normalized eigenvector would be:

[ sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2 ), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2 ) ]?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, from the earlier calculation, the ratio a/b was cot(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2). So the vector is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )) multiplied by a normalization factor. Let me compute the normalization.

The vector is [ a, b ] = [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

The norm squared is cos²(theta/2 ) + sin^2(theta/2 ) = 1. So this is already a unit vector. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), but the options have more complicated terms. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

D) (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) )

Wait, the eigenvector I found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but I have to make sure about the normalization and any factors of ħ.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator components are given in terms of ħ/2 multiplied by the matrices. So when we construct P · n, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvectors shouldn't have factors of ħ in them because eigenvectors are dimensionless (they are states, not operators). So options A and D have factors of ħ, which seems incorrect because the eigenvectors are unit vectors, and the elements are dimensionless.

Wait, but looking at option C, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I derived. So option C would be the right choice. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the eigenvector is [a, b] where a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2), and it's normalized. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So that's our answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively. So why would that be?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the process. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the direction theta is defined differently.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices. The spin operator along a direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) is given by (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z ) * ħ/2.

Wait, but in this case, the direction is in the x-z plane. So n_y = 0. So the operator becomes (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z ) * ħ/2.

But n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. Let me let n_x = sin(theta) and n_z = cos(theta), since for a direction in the x-z plane, theta is the angle from the z-axis.

So the operator is [ sin(theta) sigma_x + cos(theta) sigma_z ] * ħ/2.

The eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of sigma_z rotated by theta/2 around the y-axis.

Wait, the eigenstates are given by |+> = cos(theta/2)|↑> + sin(theta/2)|↓>, and |-> = -sin(theta/2)|↑> + cos(theta/2)|↓>.

Wait, that seems to match what I did earlier. So the eigenvector for +ħ/2 is indeed (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2 )).

So looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2 )). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me look at the options again:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so that's exactly what we have. So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each represented as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero, and the operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta
\]

The matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$ are:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Thus, the matrix representation of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0
\]

Substituting the matrix, the system of equations becomes:

\[
\begin{cases}
\left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos\theta - \frac{\hbar}{2} \right) a + \frac{\hbar}{2} \sin\theta \, b = 0 \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} \sin\theta \, a + \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \cos\theta - \frac{\hbar}{2} \right) b = 0
\end{cases}
\]

Simplifying the first equation:

\[
\left( \cos\theta - 1 \right) a + \sin\theta \, b = 0
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the ratio $a/b$ becomes:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) \, b
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

This vector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not match the derived components.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived components and introduces an unphysical phase factor $e^{i\phi}$.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary normalization factors $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$.

The correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
