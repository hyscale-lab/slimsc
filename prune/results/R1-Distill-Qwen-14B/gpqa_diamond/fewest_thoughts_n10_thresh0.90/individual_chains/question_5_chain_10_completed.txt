Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that we have an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. And we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, P is the momentum operator, I think, but in this case, it's represented in terms of its components.

Wait, so the direction n is in the x-z plane. So that means the vector n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because any direction in the x-z plane has no y-component. Or wait, no, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuth around the z-axis. Since n is in the x-z plane, phi would be 0 or pi, I guess. Because in the x-z plane, the angle phi (azimuthal) is 0 or pi, so the direction is along x and z.

So the operator P along direction n would be P·n. Which is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). 

Wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So P·n is (sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z).

But each of these P components is (ħ/2) times a matrix.

Wait, let me write down each component:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P·n is (ħ/2)[ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's compute the matrix part first. The matrix is:

sinθ * [ [0,1],[1,0] ] + cosθ * [ [1,0],[0,-1] ]

So adding these together:

First row: [ sinθ*0 + cosθ*1 , sinθ*1 + cosθ*0 ] → [ cosθ, sinθ ]
Second row: [ sinθ*1 + cosθ*0 , sinθ*0 + cosθ*(-1) ] → [ sinθ, -cosθ ]

So the matrix is:
[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P·n = (ħ/2) * this matrix.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

(P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Hmm. Let's write the matrix equation. Let the matrix be M = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. Then the equation is M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Which can be written as:

(ħ/2)[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can cancel out the (ħ/2) from both sides, so:

[cosθ a + sinθ b,
 sinθ a - cosθ b] = [a; b]

So setting up the equations:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → (cosθ -1) a = -sinθ b → equation (1)
sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a = (1 + cosθ) b → equation (2)

From equation (1):

a = [ -sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Hmm, cosθ -1 is equal to -2 sin^2(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So substituting:

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / ( -2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel. 2 cancels. So:

a = [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / sin^2(theta/2) ] b → cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) → cot(theta/2)

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Alternatively, a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * b → a = [cot(theta/2)] b.

Let me substitute a into equation (2):

sinθ a = (1 + cosθ) b

Substituting a = [cot(theta/2)] b → sinθ * cot(theta/2) * b = (1 + cosθ) b

Divide both sides by b (assuming b ≠0, which it should be for eigenvector):

sinθ * cot(theta/2) = 1 + cosθ

Let me compute sinθ * cot(theta/2):

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So sinθ * cot(theta/2) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] = 2 cos²(theta/2)

So left side is 2 cos²(theta/2), right side is 1 + cosθ.

But 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2). Because using the double-angle identity: cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1 → 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2).

So yes, equation holds. So our substitution is correct.

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

Now, let me express the eigenvector in terms of b. Let's set b = 1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple). Then a = cot(theta/2). So the vector is [a; b] = [cot(theta/2), 1]^T.

But wait, cot(theta/2) can be written as cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So vector is [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1]^T.

But we need to normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

But since the components are complex? Wait, no, the components a and b are real in this case? Because P·n is a Hermitian operator, since it's a component of the angular momentum operator (or similar). So the eigenstates are real for this case.

Wait, but the eigenvectors for spin-1/2 systems are generally two-component vectors. Let me compute the normalization.

The components are a = cot(theta/2), b=1.

So normalization is:

a^2 + b^2 = [cot^2(theta/2) + 1] = [ (cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ) / sin^2(theta/2) ) ] = [1 / sin^2(theta/2) ]

Because cot^2 +1 = csc^2.

So 1/(sin^2(theta/2)) ) = 1 → sin^2(theta/2) = 1 → sin(theta/2) = ±1. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would require theta/2 = pi/2 → theta=pi, but that's a specific case. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming normalization.

Wait, the vector is [a; b] = [cot(theta/2), 1]^T. The squared magnitude is (cot^2(theta/2) + 1) = csc^2(theta/2) = 1/sin^2(theta/2).

So to make it normalized, we need to multiply by sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so when multiplied by sin(theta/2), it becomes cos(theta/2). And the second component is sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{i phi} sinθ), which looks like spherical coordinates but not for our case.

Option D has sqrt terms, so probably not.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So direction n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but in our case, the operator is in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector is expressed in terms of theta, the polar angle from the z-axis. So our solution aligns with that.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, where $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z \right).
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the resulting matrix is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
\cos\theta a + \sin\theta b = a, \quad \sin\theta a - \cos\theta b = b.
\]

From these equations, we find that $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$. Substituting $b = 1$ (arbitrary choice for eigenvector normalization), we get $a = \cot(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the squared magnitude:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = \cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2).
\]

The normalized eigenvector is then:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it does not involve $\theta/2$.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it describes spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$ factors.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
