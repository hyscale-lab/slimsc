Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformal metric because it's a scalar multiple of the flat metric in 2D. So, the general form is ds² = E(dx² + dy²), where E is a function of x and y here.

I remember that the area element in 2D for a metric like this is usually the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor here is diagonal with components [E, 0, 0, E], so the determinant should be E * E - 0 = E²? Wait no, wait. Wait, the metric is 2x2, so the determinant is just E * E since it's diagonal. So determinant is E², and the area element dA would be sqrt(det) dx dy. But since E is the scaling factor, the area element is E dx dy.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the determinant for a 2D metric is (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy^2). Here, g_xx is E, g_yy is E, and g_xy is zero. So determinant is E * E = E². The area element is sqrt(det) dx dy, so that's sqrt(E²) dx dy, which is E dx dy because E is positive (assuming the denominator is positive, so 4 - x² - y² > 0). So E is 32/(4 - x² - y²), so dA = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, that's the area element. Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, wait. Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh, right, in the context of general relativity, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, I thought pseudospheres are like the tractricoid, which is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature. Alternatively, in the context of metrics, perhaps it refers to a 2D surface embedded in some space, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the 2D surface described by this metric, and the pseudosphere is the
