Okay, I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question. Let's break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly correct except for two peaks that shouldn't be there. These two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. The chemical shifts are similar, and their integrals add up to 1H. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the same proton showing two peaks but not due to splittingâ€”what else could it be?

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, matching the expected molecule. So, same mass but two peaks in LC-MS. That suggests maybe something about the structure causing the same mass but different retention times.

Wait, the possible options. Let's go through them:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different mass, right? Because it's the starting material before the reaction. But the LC-MS shows same mass as expected, so probably not A.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same mass, same everything except configuration. They'd have same retention time? Wait, no, actually, in chiral columns, they might separate, but if the LC is not a chiral column, they might co-elute. But in this case, the problem states that both peaks have same mass. Also, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. Enantiomers have the same NMR spectra, because they're mirror images. So in NMR, you wouldn't see two peaks for one proton. So probably not B.

C) 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too sure about that. Double coupling would imply some kind of coupling with two different nuclei, but I'm not sure. Wait, the NMR shows same alpha proton, but two peaks. Could it be something like a double bond that's causing coupling? But the user said they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's not about coupling between protons but rather something else.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so would have different NMR spectra. But wait, if the two diastereomers have the same environment for that particular alpha proton, then maybe they'd show up as a doublet? But in reality, if there are two diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons. So integrating them would give a sum that equals the expected 1H. Wait, but in the NMR, it's the same alpha proton. So maybe the alpha proton is in the same environment in both diastereomers. Hmm. Or perhaps the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton, leading to overlapping peaks. But wait, they wouldn't have the same shift because their structures are different, right? Unless the diastereomers have the same environment for that proton for some reason. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, another thought: if the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, but the integral adds up to 1H, that suggests that each peak is 0.5H each. So maybe the proton is split into two because of some kind of coupling or because of exchange between two states.

But the user says spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So, maybe it's an issue with the sample, like some kind of tautomerism or exchange between two forms. Or perhaps the compound is a racemic mixture, but wait, in that case, the NMR would look the same because the protons are in the same environment. So racemic doesn't explain the two peaks.

Alternatively, if the compound is a diastereomeric mixture where the diastereomers have the same shift for that particular proton, then you'd see two peaks. But I thought that diastereomers usually have different shifts. Unless the two diastereomers have the same environment for that specific proton. Hmm, not common, but possible?

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So same molecular weight. That suggests the same molecular formula. So the only possibilities are enantiomers or diastereomers. But if they were diastereomers, the NMR would show different shifts. So unless the diastereomers have the same shift for that alpha proton, which is unlikely.

Wait, another angle: The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, but same shift. So maybe the sample is a racemic mixture, but then the NMR wouldn't show two peaks because each enantiomer contributes the same shift. So that can't explain the two peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers that each have the same shift for that proton. But that's hard to imagine. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has some sort of dynamic process, like a rapidly interconverting diastereomer, but that would average the shifts, perhaps. But the question says the peaks are similar shifts, so maybe they're in a slow exchange situation.

Wait, but the integral adds up to 1H. So each peak is 0.5H. Maybe the molecule is exchanging between two forms where the alpha proton is split.

Wait, another possibility: if the molecule has an alpha proton that's undergoing some kind of coupling with another nucleus, but that's probably not the case here as spin-spin coupling was ruled out. Hmm.

Alternatively, the problem could be that the compound is a result of a side reaction. For example, during the synthesis, maybe a double bond was formed in a different position. But then the LC-MS would show a different mass, so that's not the case.

Wait, the question says the 1H NMR is consistent except two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So perhaps the problem is that the same alpha proton is split into two due to some other coupling, but the user said that's not the case. So they ruled out spin-spin, which is usually between protons. So maybe it's coupling to a neighboring spin system, but it's ruled out.

Alternatively, maybe the sample is contaminated with a diastereomer. Wait, but the same mass. So if it's a diastereomer, the same mass would make sense. So in the NMR, each diastereomer would contribute a peak for the same proton. But if the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton, then you would see two peaks, each with 0.5H. But that's a big if.

Wait, but diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR shifts would usually be different. So it's unlikely that two diastereomers would have the same shift for an alpha proton. So that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: if the compound has an impurity that's an isomer. But then the mass would be different. So, that's probably not the case.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass but different retention times. That suggests that both are the same compound, but perhaps in different conformations or something that doesn't change the mass. Or, perhaps, the same compound is present in two different forms, like different tautomers or stereoisomers.

Wait, the options are:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. No, because mass is same.

B) Enantiomers. They have same mass, but NMR would not show two peaks.

C) Double coupling during amide bond formation. Not sure what that means. Maybe some kind of coupling that leads to splitting, but the user says spin-spin is ruled out.

D) Diastereomers. Same mass, but different NMR shifts. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for same proton. So how?

Wait, another angle: the crude compound might have a byproduct that's a diastereomer. So, for example, during the synthesis, two different diastereomers were formed. But diastereomers have different NMR shifts, right? Unless the proton in question is in the same environment in both. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the crude compound has a mixture of two diastereomers, each contributing to two peaks for the same proton. But the integral adds up to 1H, so each diastereomer contributes 0.5H. But why would each diastereomer cause the same alpha proton to split into two? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the synthesis. The compound is a mixture of two diastereomers. Let's say, for example, the amide bond formation went wrong and formed two diastereomers. The same mass (since same molecular formula), same LC retention times? No, because diastereomers have different physical properties. Wait, but in the LC-MS, they have the same mass and same retention time? No, the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity but same mass. So same retention time? No, because that would just be one peak. So perhaps, they have the same mass but different retention times. That suggests that they are structurally different but same mass.

Wait, same mass but different structures. So same molecular formula. That can be enantiomers or diastereomers.

So, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. If it's diastereomers, their shifts would be different, so two separate peaks. But with the same integral, each being 0.5H. So in the NMR, each diastereomer contributes 0.5H for that proton. But why would the shifts be similar? Maybe the two diastereomers have the same environment for that particular alpha proton. Like, if the diastereomeric centers are not near that proton, so the chemical shift is the same. So, for example, if the diastereomerism is in another part of the molecule, away from the alpha proton. Then, the NMR would see two peaks with similar shifts and each contributing 0.5H. That could fit.

But would that cause the same integral. Yes, because each diastereomer contributes 0.5H, so total 1H.

And in the LC-MS, same mass but two peaks. So, the diastereomers would have the same mass (same molecular formula) but different retention times, hence two peaks. Or perhaps, same retention times if the column doesn't separate them. Wait, but the question says that the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So same mass but different retention times, implying that they are two separate compounds of same mass. But that would require same molecular formula, right?

Wait, same molecular formula but different structures. So, diastereomers. So, the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers, which have the same mass but different retention times (hence two peaks in LC). So in the NMR, each diastereomer contributes a peak for the same alpha proton, which in this case has the same shift. So two peaks, same shift, each 0.5H, total 1H. That lines up with the observations.

So, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereomers, which would be option D.

Wait, but option C is about double coupling during amide bond formation. What's that? Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, some coupling occurred where a proton is coupled to two different groups. But I'm not familiar with that term. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of having two different coupling partners, but the user ruled out spin-spin, so that's not it.

So, I'm leaning towards D) mixture of diastereoisomers.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause. LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would have a different molecular mass, as it is an earlier intermediate in the synthesis. However, the LC-MS data shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected product, ruling out this option.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers have the same molecular mass and chemical shifts in NMR because they are mirror images. However, in this case, the NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton, which is inconsistent with enantiomers. Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The term "double coupling" is unclear in this context, but the question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling has been ruled out. Additionally, there is no evidence in the data to suggest that coupling to another nucleus or group is responsible for the observed peaks. This makes this option less plausible.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have the same molecular mass but different physical properties, such as NMR shifts and retention times. If the two diastereoisomers have the same environment for the alpha-proton in question, their chemical shifts could overlap, leading to two peaks in the NMR spectrum. The LC-MS data showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass supports the presence of diastereoisomers. This explanation aligns well with the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for the identical mass in LC-MS, the two distinct peaks in NMR, and the absence of spin-spin coupling as a factor.

**Answer: D**
