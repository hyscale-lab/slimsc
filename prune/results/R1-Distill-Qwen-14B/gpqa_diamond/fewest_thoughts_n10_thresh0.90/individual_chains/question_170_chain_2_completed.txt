Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve calculating the average value you'd expect to measure, right?

The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, does that mean the spinor is a column vector with components 3i and 4? So the state χ is [3i, 4]^T. Oh, right, that's how spinors are represented in quantum mechanics.

The operator for S_y, the spin in the y-direction, is given as σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Because I remember that for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) times the sigma_y matrix.

Looking at sigma_y, it's the matrix:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So, S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. Therefore, S_y = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

The expectation value is the bra-ket product of χ with S_y acting on χ. So, ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩.

Let me write that out. The expectation value is χ† * S_y * χ. But since χ is a column vector, χ† is a row vector with complex conjugates.

So χ is [3i, 4]^T. Therefore, χ† is [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, wait. Wait, the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? No, wait, wait. No. Wait, 3i is a purely imaginary number. Its complex conjugate is -3i.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Let me correct that. The complex conjugate of a + bi is a - bi. So if you have 3i, which is 0 + 3i, the conjugate is 0 - 3i, which is -3i. So χ† is [-3i, 4], right? Because the second component is 4, which is real, so its conjugate is itself.

Wait no, wait. Wait, χ is [3i, 4]^T. So χ† is [3i^*, 4^*] = [ -3i, 4 ]. Because the conjugate of 3i is -3i. So the row vector is [ -3i, 4 ].

So now, compute S_y acting on χ. Let me compute that. Let's compute S_y * χ.

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So applying this matrix to χ:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = 0 + (-i)(4) = -4i.
Second component: (i)(3i) + 0*(4) = i*(3i) = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y * χ is (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ]. So the dot product is:

(-3i)( -4i ) + (4)(-3) all multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each term.

Wait, no. Let me do it step by step.

So χ† * S_y * χ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, no. Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) times the matrix. But when I did S_y * χ, I included the (ħ/2) factor. So χ† multiplied by S_y * χ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i (ħ/2), -3 (ħ/2) ].

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Let me re-express this. Let me compute S_y * χ first, then multiply by χ†.

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So S_y * χ is (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ) ].

Wait, let's compute each component:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 -4i = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y χ is (ħ/2) [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the expectation value is χ† (S_y χ) = [ -3i, 4 ] * (ħ/2) [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, but the multiplication is a dot product. So it's ( -3i )*( -4i ) + 4 * (-3 ), all multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12 (-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by ħ/2: (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, they have fractions like 12 ħ/25. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a second, wait. Oh no, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the state vector is [3i, 4]^T. So χ is [3i;4], and χ† is [3i*, 4*] = [-3i, 4].

So S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So when I compute S_y χ:

First component: 0 *3i + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i *3i + 0 *4 = 3i^2 = -3.

So S_y χ is (ħ/2) [ -4i, -3 ].

Then, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the product is:

( -3i ) * (-4i ) (this is the first term) plus (4)*(-3) (second term).

Compute each:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (ħ/2): (ħ/2)(-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have -12 ħ. The options are fractions with denominator 25. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me go through this again.

Wait, the state vector is given as (3i,4). So that's the state vector χ, right? So χ is [3i, 4]^T.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized. Let's check if this state is normalized. The norm is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5^2, so the state is not normalized. Oh! Right, that's a mistake. So the state isn't normalized, so when we compute expectation values, we need to normalize it.

So the expectation value is actually (χ† S_y χ) divided by (χ† χ).

Wait, because the state is not normalized. So the expectation value is (⟨χ | S_y | χ⟩ ) / (⟨χ | χ⟩ ).

So let me compute that.

First, compute ⟨χ|χ⟩:

(3i)* 3i + 4*4 = (9i^2) + 16 = 9*(-1) + 16 = -9 +16=7? Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. The inner product is χ† χ, which is (3i)* (3i) +4*4.

Wait, (3i)* is -3i. So (-3i)*(3i) = -9 i^2 = -9*(-1) =9.

Then, 4*4=16.

So χ† χ =9+16=25. So the normalization is 25.

So the expectation value is ( -12 ħ ) / 25? Because earlier I got -24 ħ/2, which is -12 ħ.

Wait wait, no. Let me re-calculate.

Earlier, I had ( S_y χ ) = (ħ/2) [ -4i, -3 ].

Then, χ† (S_y χ) is [ -3i,4 ] times [ -4i, -3 ] times (ħ/2).

So let's compute it again.

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1)= -12.

Second term: 4*(-3 )= -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (ħ/2) → (-24)(ħ/2) = -12 ħ.

Then, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ( -12 ħ ) divided by the norm squared (which is 25), so:

⟨S_y⟩= (-12 ħ ) / 25.

Looking back at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25, which is what I'm getting.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again because I get confused sometimes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the S_y χ calculation.

Wait, let me recompute S_y χ:

S_y is (ħ/2) [[0, -i],[i,0]].

Multiply by χ = [3i,4]^T.

So first component:

0 *3i + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component:

i*3i + 0*4 = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y χ is (ħ/2)[ -4i, -3 ].

Now, χ† is [ -3i,4 ].

So the product χ† (S_y χ) is:

[ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i (ħ/2 ), -3 (ħ/2) ].

Wait, wait, no. That's a dot product. So ( -3i )*(-4i) + 4*(-3 ), all multiplied by (ħ/2).

So let's compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Sum these: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (ħ/2): -24 * (ħ/2) = -12 ħ.

Then, the norm of χ is sqrt( (3i)(-3i) +4*4 ) = sqrt( 9*(-i^2) +16 )= sqrt(9*1 +16)= sqrt(25)=5. So the norm squared is 25.

So the expectation value is (-12 ħ ) / 25.

Which matches option A: -12 ħ/25.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( \langle S_y \rangle \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is given by:
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y, \quad \text{where } \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **State Vector**: The given spin state is \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). To compute the expectation value, we need the conjugate transpose of \( \chi \), which is:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Action of \( S_y \) on \( \chi \)**: Compute \( S_y \chi \):
   \[
   S_y \chi = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   - First component:
     \[
     (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = -4i.
     \]
   - Second component:
     \[
     (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i^2 = -3.
     \]
   Thus:
   \[
   S_y \chi = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Expectation Value**: The expectation value \( \langle S_y \rangle \) is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \chi^\dagger (S_y \chi).
   \]
   Substituting \( \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( S_y \chi = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} \), we compute:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left[ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) \right].
   \]
   - First term:
     \[
     (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12.
     \]
   - Second term:
     \[
     4(-3) = -12.
     \]
   Adding these:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} (-12 - 12) = \frac{\hbar}{2} (-24) = -12\hbar.
   \]

5. **Normalization**: The state \( \chi \) is not normalized. Its norm squared is:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \chi = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   Therefore, the normalized expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final Answer**: Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \boxed{-\frac{12\hbar}{25}}.
   \]

**Answer: A**
