Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what's going on.

So the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down reaction by reaction.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, like a four-fused cyclohexane rings. The 1,3-dibromo would mean bromine atoms are on adjacent positions in this structure.

Heating with KOH (a strong base) probably leads to an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. But wait, KOH is a good base and a good nucleophile. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination? Or perhaps it's a substitution followed by elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, when dibrominated compounds react with strong bases, sometimes they undergo elimination to form alkenes. But given adamantane's structure, maybe the elimination leads to a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening to form a diol or something else.

Wait, the product after KOH treatment is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. The IR peak around 1720 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester.

So, product 1 has a carbonyl. That suggests that the reaction with KOH might have resulted in some kind of oxidation or perhaps elimination leading to a carbonyl. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Wait, maybe elimination followed by some kind of cyclization forms a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material undergoes a Hofmann elimination or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when dihalides (like 1,3-dibromocyclohexane) are treated with a base, they can undergo elimination to form alkenes. But in this case, the product has a carbonyl. So maybe the reaction is a double elimination, like forming two carbonyls? Or perhaps the elimination produces an alkene and then some oxidation happens? No, because the reaction is just heating with KOH, which shouldn't oxidize in that way. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure rearranges. For example, when a dihalide is treated with base, especially in a cyclic structure, it can form an
