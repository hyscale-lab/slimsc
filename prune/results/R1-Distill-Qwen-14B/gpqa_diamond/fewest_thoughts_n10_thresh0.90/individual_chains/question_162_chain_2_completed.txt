Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions because there are only dx and dy terms. So, this is a 2-dimensional metric. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Oh wait, wait—pseudosphere is a term I associate with hyperbolic geometry. But maybe the question is referring to a 2D surface, perhaps a sphere in some space.

Wait, no, pseudosphere in 2D is like the tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But here, the question is about the area, so maybe I should calculate the area in this metric.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y, but I wonder if this is a 2D manifold embedded in some higher-dimensional space or if it's a 2D spacetime? But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere, which is a 2D surface. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric provided is for a 2-dimensional space, and the question is about finding the area of a region (like a sphere) in that space.

Wait, but the options given are expressions involving x² and y², except option A and D. Option D is positive infinity, which suggests that perhaps the area isn't finite.

Wait, the question says "the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Oh, wait, a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature, right? So maybe the metric is that of a pseudosphere, and we're to compute its area.

But wait, how does the metric relate to curvature? The metric's form might give information about the curvature. Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a hyperbolic space.

Wait, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's see, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). So the denominator is positive when x² + y² < 4, which suggests that the metric is defined within the circle of radius 2 (since 4 is 2 squared) in the x-y plane. So the domain is x² + y² < 4.

Wait, but if the radius is 2, then (x² + y²) < 4 is the region we're looking at. So the metric is defined only in that region. What happens as x² + y² approaches 4? The denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up. That suggests that the boundary at x² + y² =4 is like a singularity, perhaps a point at infinity.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, maybe I should compute the area using the given metric.

In differential geometry, the area element in 2D is given by sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Let's compute that.

The metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))²? Wait, no, the metric tensor components are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is g_xx * g_yy - 0 (since it's diagonal), so the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)]², where r² = x² + y².

So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, sqrt of determinant is sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)]² ) = 32/(4 - r²). So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, but integrating dx dy over the region r² <4 with this area element. So the total area A would be the integral over r from 0 to 2 of (32/(4 - r²)) * 2π r dr. Because we can switch to polar coordinates.

So A = integral from 0 to 2 of [32/(4 - r²)] * 2π r dr.

Wait, let me compute that. Let's factor out the constants: 32 * 2π = 64π. So A = 64π ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [r dr/(u)] * (-du/(2r)) ). Wait, let me see.

Wait, substituting r dr = (-du)/2. So the integral becomes:

∫ (from 4 to 0) [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which is the same as (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to4) (du/u) ).

Because flipping the limits removes the negative sign. So 1/2 ∫ (0 to4) du/u = (1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to4. But wait, ln(4) minus ln(0). But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral diverges. That would mean the area is infinite.

But wait, that can't be right, because for a pseudosphere (which is hyperbolic space), the area is infinite. Oh wait, wait, pseudosphere is a surface of revolution with infinite extent? Or is it a finite surface? Wait, no, the tractricoid is a finite area surface. Or maybe I'm confusing it with hyperbolic space.

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the space is homogeneous and isotropic, but it's infinite in extent. So the total area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is finite. Wait, no, the tractricoid is a finite surface—it's a surface of revolution with finite area. So why is the integral giving an infinite area here?

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given isn't that of a tractricoid but another surface.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. But in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (which is a pseudosphere) with radius r is (4π r²) / ( -k ), where k is the Gaussian curvature. Wait, Gaussian curvature K is negative for hyperbolic surfaces. So K = -1/(r²), perhaps. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, the area of a hyperbolic pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution) with radius a (the radius at the waist) would have area 4π a^2. But wait, that's for a tractricoid, which has finite area.

Wait, but in our metric, when we integrate the area element over the entire domain (r² <4), the integral diverges. So the area is infinite. But the tractricoid has finite area. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the metric given isn't that of the tractricoid. Let me think about the metric structure. The metric is ds² = [32/(4-x²-y²)] (dx² + dy²). So as x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. So the area element becomes large near the boundary.

That suggests that the area is infinite because the region near the boundary (r approaching 2) contributes infinitely to the area.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is usually a surface with finite area. So maybe this isn't a pseudosphere? Or perhaps the question is using a different definition.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is that of a sphere with a different radius.

Wait, but the options suggest that the area could be 4π(x² + y²), which is not a constant, but that doesn't make sense because area should be a scalar, not depending on x and y. So that can't be right.

Option A is 0, which seems unlikely. Option D is +infinite. So if the integral diverges, then the area is infinite.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D) +infty.

Wait, but why would the area of a pseudosphere be infinite? Oh, wait, maybe the metric describes a different kind of surface. Because in the given metric, as you approach the boundary x² + y² =4 (r=2), the area element blows up, leading to an infinite area when integrating over the entire disk. So the entire region is not a compact surface, and thus the area is infinite.

But in the case of a pseudosphere (tractricoid), it's a compact surface, so its area is finite. So perhaps this metric isn't describing a pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the area within the metric given, and if the area is infinite, the answer would be D.

So looking back, the options are A)0, B)4π(x²+y²), C)4π(x² - y²), D)+infty.

Option D is the only one that makes sense because the integral of the area element diverges. So the area is infinite.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is defined in a 2-dimensional space with coordinates \(x\) and \(y\). The metric blows up as \(x^2 + y^2\) approaches 4, indicating a singularity at the boundary \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\). The task is to compute the area of a pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) in this metric.

The area element in a 2D metric is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(g\) is the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant of the metric tensor is 

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes 

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integration over \(\theta\) gives a factor of \(2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral simplifies to:

\[
A = 64\pi \cdot \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
A = 32\pi \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 32\pi \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 = -\infty\), the integral diverges, meaning the total area is infinite. This suggests that the metric describes a region where the area element becomes unbounded near the boundary \(r = 2\), leading to an infinite total area.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as the area should be a scalar, not dependent on \(x\) and \(y\).
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect for the same reason as B.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the integral diverges, indicating an infinite area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere in this metric is infinite.

Answer: D
