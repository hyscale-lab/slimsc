Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. Okay, the question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰.

Okay, let's break down what I know. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are all different resolutions, which I think refers to the minimum distance that can be resolved or measured in the chamber.

Wait, so the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving at high speeds, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. Oh right, because of special relativity. So the lifetime in the lab frame τ is gamma times τ₀, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated using gamma = E / m, since E = gamma m c², and c is the speed of light (but maybe in units where c=1, so E = gamma m). So E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let me do this roughly: 3.41 × 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 × 7.9 is around 27.0 (since 0.9×3.41=3.069, so 7×3.41=23.87 +3.069=26.939). So approximately 7.93. So gamma is about 7.93.

So the lab frame lifetime τ is gamma * τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 s, so τ is 7.93 × 8e-16. Let me compute that: 7.93 * 8 is around 63.44, so τ ≈ 63.44e-16 seconds, which is 6.344e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second. The lifetime is the proper time multiplied by gamma, right? So τ = gamma * τ₀. Yup, that's correct.

Now, the particles will travel some distance before decaying. The distance L they can travel before decaying is given by L = v * t, where v is the velocity, and t is the lifetime in the lab frame. But wait, another approach is that the average decay length is c * τ. Because v is approximately c for high-energy particles. So, L = c * τ.

But wait, since gamma is significant, perhaps we should compute v. Let's see, gamma is 7.93, so beta (v/c) can be found using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me solve for beta.

Gamma is 7.93, so gamma squared is about 62.9. So 1 - beta² = 1 / (gamma²) = 1/62.9 ≈ 0.01589. So beta² ≈ 1 - 0.01589 = 0.98411. So beta is sqrt(0.98411) ≈ 0.992. So v is approximately 0.992c.

So the speed v is 0.992c. Then, the time in the lab frame is τ = gamma τ₀. So the distance L is v * τ = (0.992c) * gamma τ₀.

Alternatively, since v is about c, perhaps we can approximate v as c for the calculation, which would make L ≈ c * gamma τ₀. Let me proceed with that approximation because it's easier, and see where that leads me.

So, c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So L = c * tau = (3e8 m/s) * (6.344e-15 s) = 3e8 *6.344e-15 = 1.9032e-6 meters. So about 1.903e-6 meters, or 1.903 micrometers.

Wait, but the question isn't directly about the average decay length. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so I think this is about the detector's ability to resolve the decay point. If the particles decay over a range of distances, the detector must have a resolution good enough to distinguish that they decayed in the chamber rather than somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the decay length and the length of the bubble chamber. But no, the problem is about the minimum resolution, which would be the smallest distance that the detector can distinguish. So perhaps we need the decay length to be such that a certain fraction (30%) of the particles decay within a region that the detector can resolve.

But wait, another approach: the number of particles that decay in the chamber is determined by the decay probability. The decay length L is the average distance they travel before decaying. So the proper question is, what's the minimum resolution required so that at least 30% of the decays are observed. Hmm, perhaps it's about the detector's ability to measure the decay point accurately. So the resolution must be on the order of the decay length multiplied by (1 - 0.3), or something like that. Or perhaps it's the full width of the decay distribution.

Wait, in particle physics, the decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The decay follows an exponential distribution, so the probability of decaying within a certain distance x is 1 - exp(-x/L), where L is the mean decay length.

So to observe at least 30% of the decays, we need to have the detector's active volume (or the region where it can detect the decay) to be such that the probability of decay within that region is at least 30%. But how does that translate into the needed resolution? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the minimum distance that the detector can measure. Because if the decay length is too large
