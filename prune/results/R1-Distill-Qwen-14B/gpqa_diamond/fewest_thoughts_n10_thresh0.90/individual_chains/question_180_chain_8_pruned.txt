Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we've got 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So 2e would be twice that, so each charge is 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. But I'll just remember that each charge is 2e for now.

The setup is an isolated system. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Oh, wait, are they all at the same point 2 meters away, or arranged in a circle around P? Hmm, the question says "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P," which makes me think they're all at the same distance. So probably, the 12 charges are placed symmetrically, maybe on a sphere of radius 2 meters centered at P. But for the purpose of calculating potential energy, maybe the exact arrangement doesn't matter because we're dealing with the potential between each pair.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Oh, wait, wait. In electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. So the minimum energy would be the potential energy of the system as it is.

Let me think: the potential energy U of a system of point charges is given by the sum over all pairs of (1/(4πε₀)) * (q_i q_j)/r_ij. Since all the 12 charges are at the same distance from the central charge, and also from each other, I can calculate each pair's contribution and sum them all up.

Wait, the fixed charge is at P, and the others are each 2 meters away. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge at P. Also, each of the 12 charges is at a certain distance from the other 11. Let's see: if they're all on a sphere of radius 2 meters, the distance between any two of them would be... Hmm, wait, but unless they're arranged in a particular way, like a regular dodecahedron, the exact distance might vary. But wait, when calculating the potential energy for all pairs among the 12, you can't ignore their mutual interactions. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves?

Hmm, this might complicate things. Wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. But it doesn't specify their positions relative to each other. So maybe it's assumed that the 12 charges are all on a sphere of radius 2 m, and the distance between any two is the same. Wait, no, that's not possible unless they're on a regular
