Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. Right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period.

The problem says that astronomers found one planet around each of two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are about the same. The planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift in the spectral line. Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the key here is to relate the Doppler shifts to the orbital periods. I remember that the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something)... Wait, maybe I should think about the formula again.

I think the formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (8 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (P)^(1/3)) )

But wait, maybe there's a simpler way to approach this. Since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the planets have similar masses, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) should be inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods. Or something like that.

Wait, because when K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3), because K scales with (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), assuming M_p is much smaller than M_star, which it is (Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun). So M_p ~ same for both planets.

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, let me think again. K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) / (since K1 = K2 * (P2/P1)^(1/3) )? Wait, maybe I'm getting it backwards. Let me arrange the proportionality.

K ∝ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )

Assuming sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, which is often the case for detected planets), then K is proportional to M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), which implies that P ∝ 1/K^(3).

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 would be shorter than P1? Wait, no. Because if K is larger, the star's velocity is higher, which happens when the planet's orbital period is shorter. Because a shorter period would mean the star is moving more quickly in its orbit.

Wait, that makes sense. For example, if a planet is very close to the star (small period), it causes a larger Doppler shift because the star's velocity is higher. So K is larger when P is smaller.

So K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. Since K2 > K1, P2 < P1.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Wait, so the ratio is P2 / P1.

Wait, maybe I should write the proportionality more clearly.

Since K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), then P ∝ 1/K^3.

So for two planets, P1 and P2, we can write:

P1 / P2 = ( K2 / K1 )^3

Because P1 is proportional to 1/K1^3 and P2 is proportional to 1/K2^3. So the ratio P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3.

Wait, let me write it out.

K1 = (some constant) / (P1^(1/3)) 
K2 = (same constant) / (P2^(1/3))

So, K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

Which can be rewritten as (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Wait, let's rederive.

From K being proportional to ( 1 / P^(1/3) ), so K = C / P^(1/3)

where C includes all the other constants (like M_p, M_star, etc., which are the same for both).

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Divide K1 by K2: K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

Which is (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, so the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Because P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So in the question, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. Which means P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1 by a factor of approximately 0.36.

But the question asks "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.36. So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Alternatively, planet #1's period is about 2.78 times longer than planet #2's.

Wait, but the question is phrased as P2 longer than P1. So, the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.36, which is less than one, meaning P2 is shorter. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1. So it's shorter, not longer. Hmm, maybe I got the ratio the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps I should have P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3.

Because from earlier, P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3.

So, if K2 is 7 and K1 is 5, then P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = (1.4)^3 ≈ 2.744.

So P1 is about 2.744 times P2. Therefore, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. Which is 0.36 times as long. So it's not longer, it's shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the correct answer would be A: 0.36.

Wait, but let me double-check.

We have P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So yes, P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So it's a shorter period.

But the question is phrased: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

Which would be P2 / P1 = 0.36 times. So it's 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter. So the correct answer is option A, ~0.36.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportion. Let me think again.

The formula from the RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v0) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (P * (1 - e^2))^(1/3) )

But when M_planet is much smaller than M_star, and e is zero (circular orbit), this simplifies. So K ≈ ( (27 pi G)^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

So if we neglect sin i (assuming it's the same for both, like edge-on), then K ∝ M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

So K1 ∝ 1/P1^(1/3)

K2 ∝ 1/P2^(1/3)

So taking the ratio:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Which again gives (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

So with K1=5, K2=7, (5/7)^3 is approximately 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, but the question asks how many times longer it is. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.


The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given their respective Doppler shifts (K1 = 5 milliangstrom and K2 = 7 milliangstrom). Both planets have similar masses, and their host stars have the same mass as the Sun. Using the Radial Velocity (RV) method, the relationship between the semi-amplitude of the spectral line shift (K) and the orbital period (P) is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \(K_1 = 5\) and \(K_2 = 7\):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
