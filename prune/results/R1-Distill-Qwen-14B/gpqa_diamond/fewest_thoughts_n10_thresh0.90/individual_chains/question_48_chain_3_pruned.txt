Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. The first reaction is treating it with bromine, which would form product 1. Hmm, what does bromine do to ketones? Oh right, in the presence of a base, bromine (Br2) can undergo an addition reaction. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ketone. When ketones react with halogens like Br2 under certain conditions, they typically undergo a halohydrin formation, but wait, that's when there's water present. Or wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, I think I'm confusing it with the addition to alkenes. No, wait, cyclohexanone is cyclic with a ketone group. So in this case, maybe bromine is doing something else. Oh wait, another possibility: the alpha position. Because cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl). So when you treat a ketone with bromine in a non-aqueous condition, perhaps it's undergoing a bromination at the alpha position. Oh, but wait, does Br2 add to the carbonyl group? No, perhaps it's an addition of HBr or something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. Bromine (Br2) in a non-polar solvent like CCl4 is used for addition to alkenes. But when a ketone is treated with Br2, perhaps it undergoes a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that would require a peracid. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation, where bromine adds across the carbonyl. Wait, in the presence of a base, like a hydroxide, or maybe without. Let me think. Oh, wait, another reaction: when a ketone is treated with bromine in a basic condition, the alpha position can undergo bromination via the enolate mechanism. So product 1 is probably 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Wait, but wait. When a cyclic ketone like cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, under what conditions? Because if it's without a base, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's an addition of Br across the carbonyl. Oh, wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is the dibromide, but that doesn't make sense because cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a substitution, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so the only alpha hydrogens are on the adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a di-substituted cyclohexane. No, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on and see if I can find the reaction steps from the products.

Wait, so product 1 is formed when cyclohexanone is treated with Br2. Then product 1 is heated with NaOH to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3. Then product 3 is treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3, which is a strong reducing agent, to form product 4.

Let me think about each step.

First step: cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Wait, another possibility: the bromine could be adding to the carbonyl group. But ketones don't typically open up to dihalides without some catalyst or under harsh conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the alpha position. So cyclohexanone has two alpha positions, each with two CH2 groups. Adding a bromine here would form a brominated cyclohexanone.

Wait, but how does that happen? Oh, maybe via the enolate. When a ketone is treated with a halogen in the presence of a base, the enolate is formed, and the halogen adds to the alpha carbon. So, if cyclohexanone is treated with Br2 and a base, perhaps it forms 2-bromocyclohexanone. But wait, the first step says it's treated with bromine, not necessarily in a basic condition. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction, but that seems unrelated. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone; perhaps it's undergoing a ring-opening. But I don't think so without a nucleophile or base.

Wait, another reaction I know: cyclohexanone can undergo a ring-opening via bromohydrin formation when treated with HBr and water. But in that case, the product would be a diol or something else. But the question says treated with Br2, not HBr. Hmm.

Wait, I'm going to make a guess here. Let's say that product 1 is 3-bromocyclohexanone. But I'm not entirely sure about that step; perhaps I should proceed and see if that makes sense.

Second step: product 1 is heated with NaOH to form product 2. NaOH is a strong base and a nucleophile. So if product 1 is a bromocyclohexanone, perhaps it undergoes an elimination reaction. For example, if product 1 has a bromine adjacent to the carbonyl, then heating with NaOH would cause an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. So perhaps product 2 is cyclohexene with a ketone group. Wait, but cyclohexanone can't lose a molecule of HBr if the bromine is on the alpha carbon. So, if product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone, then heating with NaOH would deprotonate the alpha carbon and eliminate HBr, forming a double bond. So the product would be cyclohex-1-enone? But wait, cyclohex-1-enone is a conjugated dienone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring expansion or something else, but I think elimination is more likely.

Wait, so after elimination, product 2 would be a cyclohexene ring with a ketone. So for example, 1-cyclohexenone.

Third step: product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine. SOCl2 is commonly used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, but wait, product 2 is a ketone. Oh, wait, no, wait a second. If product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (like cyclohexenone), then treating with SOCl2 would convert the ketone to an acyl chloride. Because SOCl2 reacts with carbonyl groups to form acid chlorides. So product 3 would be the corresponding acyl chloride. So if product 2 is cyclohexenone (cyclohex-1-enone), then product 3 would be cyclohex-1-enyl chloride.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, cyclohex-1-enone is a cyclic ketone with a double bond adjacent. Treating with SOCl2 would replace the ketone oxygen with Cl. So, cyclohexenone would become cyclohexenyl chloride? Or maybe it's better to think of it as the acid chloride. Wait, no, because cyclohexenone is a ketone, R-CO-R'. So SOCl2 would convert R-CO-R' to R-COCl-R', but wait, more accurately, it would form an acid chloride, but in this case, it's a ketone, so it would become an acyl chloride.

So product 3 is the acyl chloride, which is cyclohexenoyl chloride.

Fourth step: product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)3). Wait, I think that's a stronger reducing agent than typical LiAlH4. I remember that LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is used for the reductive alkylation or for the reduction of certain functional groups that are resistant to other reducing agents. But wait, in this case, product 3 is an acyl chloride. So when an acyl chloride is treated with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH(t-Bu)3, it would typically reduce the carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait, acyl chlorides can be reduced to alcohols. So, the reaction would convert the acyl chloride (RCOCl) to RCH2OH? No, wait, wait, no. Let me think. No, LiAlH4 (or similar) would reduce an acyl chloride to an alcohol. So, RCOCl + LiAlH4 → RCH2OH + LiAlCl4. Wait, no, let me be precise.

Wait, the reaction of an acyl chloride with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 would typically reduce the carbonyl group. Acyl chloride (R-COCl) would be reduced to R-CH2-OH. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the reduction of an acid chloride (RCOCl) with LiAlH4 would give RCH2OH. Wait, but is that correct? Or does it give RCH2Li which then hydrolyzes to RCH3? No, wait, that's more
