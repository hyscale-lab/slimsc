Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, let me read through it again and try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius. So B must be a solid at that temperature, maybe something like ice? Wait, ice melts at 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe something else.

Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is probably something that has an isotope, maybe like oxygen or chlorine. Wait, chlorine has isotopes, but maybe oxygen too. Not sure yet.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like maybe something like acetoacetic acid or similar. When it reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents... Oh, maybe X is something like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7? Those are strong oxidizing agents. But wait, when KMnO4 reacts with something, it produces Mn^2+ or MnO2, depending on the conditions. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, the reaction between X and liquid Y produces gas W. Let me think about possible reactions. If Y is water, then X reacting with water violently could produce H2 gas or another gas. But gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Hydrogen has H2, but each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. Maybe CO2? No, because CO2 has 12 protons (C) and 16 neutrons (O), but wait, the molecule as a whole: each CO2 molecule has (12 + 16*2) = 44, but the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, perhaps it's about each atom. Or maybe the entire molecule. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read: "gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So perhaps for each molecule, the total number of neutrons equals the total protons.

Wait, that's a bit tricky. So for example, if the molecule is H2O, the number of protons is 2 (H) + 8 (O) = 10. The number of neutrons is (0 for H) + 8 (O) = 8. So 10 vs 8. Not equal.

What about CO2? Protons: 12 (C) + 16 (O)*2 = 12 +32=44. Neutrons: 6 (C has 6 neutrons if it's C-12) + 8 (O has 8 neutrons if O-16) *2 = 6 +16 =22. So 44 protons vs 22 neutrons. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe another gas. Let's think of NH3. Protons: 14 (N) + 3 (H)*1 =17. Neutrons: 7 (N) + 0 (H) =7. 17 vs 7. No. How about CH4? Protons:6 (C) +4 =10. Neutrons:6 (C has 6 neutrons if C-12) + 0=6. 10 vs 6. Not equal.

Wait maybe it's a diatomic molecule. Let's think of O2. Each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So O2 has 16 protons, 16 neutrons. That would match! So gas W is O2? Because each O atom has 8p and 8n, so O2 has 16p and 16n. So that fits. So W is O2.

Wait, but why would X reacting with Y produce O2? That implies a decomposition reaction. Like maybe X is a peroxide, because peroxides can decompose to form O2. For example, H2O2 when heated can decompose into H2O and O2. But X is reacting with Y, which is a liquid. Maybe Y is H2O, and X is something like Na2O2 (sodium peroxide). Let me think: Na2O2 reacts with water to produce O2 and sodium hydroxide.

So if X is Na2O2, then reacting with Y (H2O) would produce O2 gas (W), and a precipitate (G). Wait, what's the precipitate? If Na2O2 reacts with water, it's usually an exothermic reaction, produces O2 and NaOH. But NaOH is a strong base, it's soluble in water. Wait, so maybe Y isn't water. Or perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe Y is an acid. If X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, reacting with an acid (like H2SO4) would produce CO2 gas. But earlier thought about W being O2 didn't fit with that.

Alternatively, if X is a chlorate, like KClO3, which when heated decomposes into KCl and O2. But that would require heating, and the reaction is with Y—maybe some catalyst or another reagent.

Wait, but the reaction is violent. So maybe X is something reactive that reacts with Y to produce O2 quickly. Like maybe a metal reacting with an acid to produce hydrogen gas, but that doesn't fit the O2 scenario.

Wait, perhaps W is not O2. Let me think of other possibilities. If W is a molecule where total protons equal total neutrons. For example, H2O: 10 protons, 8 neutrons. No. What about CH3OH? No, not diatomic. Wait, perhaps it's CO? CO has 7 protons (C) +8 (O) =15. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 8 (O) =14. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something else. Let's think of heavier elements. Let's say if W is CF4. Protons: 9 (C) + 19 (F)*4 = 9 +76=85. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 20-9=11 (each F has 7 neutrons?) Wait, F is 9 protons, so usually 9 + n = 19 (mass number 19), so neutrons per F is 10? So CF4 has C with 6 neutrons and each F with 10. So total neutrons: 6 +4*10=46. Total protons:9 +4*9=45. 46 vs 45. Not equal.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about another angle.

The precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. So B is a solid at that point. 277 K is about 4°C, so maybe B is something that melts just above 0°C. What's a substance that's solid around that temperature? Maybe water (ice melts at 273 K), so 277 is just a bit above, so perhaps B is water. Alternatively, maybe it's another compound.

Wait, when G is heated, it releases B. So G could be a hydrate. For example, if G is a copper sulfate pentahydrate, heating it would release water. The melting point of water is 273 K, but B's is close to 277 K. Wait, that's a bit higher. Maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe B is a solid with a melting point near that. What about something like glucose? No, that's way higher. Or maybe it's not a pure substance. Hmm.

Wait, maybe G is something like a carbonate, which when heated decomposes. For instance, heating calcium carbonate gives CaO and CO2, but that doesn't fit because then B would be CO2 gas, which is a gas, not a solid.

Alternatively, if X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid to produce a salt, water, and CO2. But then G would be the salt, which when heated, perhaps decomposes into something else.

Wait, let me think about the other part. The product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. A keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH). If X is something that adds oxygen, maybe it's a strong oxidizing agent. Or perhaps it's a base.

Wait, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. If X is something like KMnO4, which is a strong oxidizing agent, it could oxidize the keto acid. But how would that affect the number of oxygen atoms?

Alternatively, maybe X is a base like NaOH. Reacting a keto acid with NaOH would neutralize it, producing a salt. For example, a keto acid (RCOOR') would react with NaOH to form a sodium salt (RCOOR'Na) and water. But that's perhaps not adding oxygen, but replacing a proton.

Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is something like H2O2? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the product is a simple oxide. Hmm, not sure.

Let me try another angle. The substance X has a heavier isotope. So maybe X is a compound where one of the elements has a heavier isotope. Like, for example, iodine has a heavy isotope, but perhaps in a compound like HIO3 or something.

Wait, but X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include KMnO4, K2Cr2O7 (for oxidation), NaOH (for saponification), H2SO4 (as a catalyst), etc.

Wait, KMnO4: reaction with what? KMnO4 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. It can oxidize various organic compounds. But when it reacts with something, it typically produces Mn^2+ or MnO2, depending on the conditions.

But the question says that when X reacts with Y, a gas W is released, which is O2 as we thought earlier. So maybe X is Na2O2, and Y is water. The reaction would be:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑

So W is O2. Then the precipitate G is NaOH? But NaOH is soluble in water, so that wouldn't form a precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps Y is not water. Maybe Y is a different liquid. Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide and Y is an acid.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is something else. If X is Na2O2, and Y is H2SO4, then the reaction would be:

Na2O2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O2

Wait, but then what happens? H2O2 is unstable and can decompose into H2O and O2. So maybe that's how O2 is produced, but then G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble. So that doesn't fit the precipitate.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is something else. Another approach: when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. If B is water (melting point 273 K), then maybe G is a hydrate. For example, if G is a copper sulfate hydrate, heating it would release water.

Wait, but in that case, B would be H2O, which would have a melting point of 273 K, close to the given 277 K. But the question says 'very close', so maybe B is another substance. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like glucose or another solid with a higher melting point than ice.

Wait, maybe B is something like formaldehyde, but I don't think that's right
