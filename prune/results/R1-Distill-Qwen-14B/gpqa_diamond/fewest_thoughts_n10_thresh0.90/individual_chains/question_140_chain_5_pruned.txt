Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a reaction where Substance X reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog.

I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are numbers, so probably the sum of two atomic masses.

First, let's break down the information.

1. Gas W: same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. The simplest possibility is that W is H2O, but wait, H has 1 proton and O has 8. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, the molecule as a whole has same number of protons and neutrons. Oh, because each molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton) and O with 8 protons. Total protons: 2+8=10. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8 (since O-16 is common). So 8. So 10 protons vs 8 neutrons: not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of possible gases. Maybe CO2? No, that's a gas but let's see. CO2 has C (6 protons) and O (8), so each molecule has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12), O has 8 each (O-16), so 6 + 2*8=22. So protons and neutrons are both 22. That fits! So W could be CO2. Wait, but CO2 is a gas released, but wait, in a reaction between X and Y, which is liquid.

Alternatively, what about H2O? Each H has 1 proton (total 2), O has 8: so 10. But the neutrons: O-16 has 8, H has 0. So 8. 10 vs 8, not equal. So doesn't fit.

Another possibility: CH4. Each molecule has 6 protons (C) + 4 H = 10 protons. Neutrons: C (6) + H (each 0) = 6. 10 vs 6: nope.

What about NH3? Protons: 14 (N) +3 H =17. Neutrons: N has 7 (if N-14), H=0. So 7.
