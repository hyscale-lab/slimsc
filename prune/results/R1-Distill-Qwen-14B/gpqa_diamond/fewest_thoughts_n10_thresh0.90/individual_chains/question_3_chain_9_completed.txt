Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

Hmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. For a given state ψ, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. To find the expectation value, I can compute it as the sum of the expectation values of each term. Because expectation values are linear, so ⟨A+B⟩ = ⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩, and ⟨cO⟩ = c⟨O⟩ where c is a constant.

So first, I can break it into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ and 5⟨σx⟩. Then sum them together.

Let me first find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. Wait, yes, because σz|↑⟩ = |↑⟩, so eigenvalue is 1, and σz|↓⟩ = -|↓⟩, so eigenvalue is -1.

Given that the state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. So the coefficients are a=0.5 for |↑⟩ and b= sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|² * (1) + |b|² * (-1). Because the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

Calculating that:

|a|² = (0.5)^2 = 0.25
|b|² = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3)/4 = 0.75

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, but those are different from |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So I can't directly use the eigenstates for that. I think I'll have to compute ⟨ψ | σx | ψ⟩.

Alternatively, maybe I can express σx in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Wait, σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So let's compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Expanding ψ: ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So ψ is a column vector [a, b]^T.

σx as a matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when I compute σx |ψ⟩, it swaps the components: so the result is [b, a]^T.

Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the inner product of ψ† (which is [a*, b*]) and σx|ψ⟩.

Which is a* * b + b* * a. Since a and b are real numbers here (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2), their conjugates are the same.

So, a*b + b*a = 2ab.

Wait, that's because ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = a*b + b*a. Wait no, wait: ψ is a column vector, so when I do ψ† σx ψ, it's a* σx_11 a + a* σx_12 b + b* σx_21 a + b* σx_22 b.

But σx_11 is 0, σx_12 is 1, σx_21 is 1, σx_22 is 0. So it's a* * 1 * b + b* *1 * a.

Which is a*b + b*a, which is 2ab.

So yeah, it's 2ab.

So a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

So ab is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330.

So 2ab is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another approach is to compute the expectation value as a sum over the basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the expectation value of σx in state ψ.

Another way to compute it is to write the matrix for σx and compute ψ† σx ψ.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

ψ is [a, b] = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σx is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by σx, which is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the resulting row vector is [ (0.5*0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*1), (0.5*1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0) ] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, multiply by ψ: [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].

Which is (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, same result. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

Wait, wait. Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5 * 0.866 is about 4.33.

So putting it all together, the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = (-5) + 4.33 ≈ -0.67.

Wait, wait, but let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, 10⟨σz⟩ is -5.

5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

So sum is -5 + 4.3301 ≈ -0.6699.

Wait, that's approximately -0.67, but looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is near that. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in evaluating the expectation value of σx.

Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the coefficients are a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So when computing ⟨σx⟩, it's a*b + b*a = 2ab.

ab = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330.

So 2ab is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

So total expectation is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.

Hmm, that's about -0.67, which when rounded to one decimal is -0.7. So the closest option is C) -0.7.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Did I correctly compute the expectation value of σx?

Another way: σx has eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, with eigenvalues +1 and -1.

But our state is in the σz basis. So another approach is to write the state in the |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ basis, but that might complicate things more. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation values.

Wait, perhaps I can compute ⟨σx⟩ another way.

The state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩.

The expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b ) = 2 Re(a b*).

Since a and b are real, it's 2 a b.

Which is the same as before, so 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2*( sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2, same as before.

So that's correct. So the expectation of σx is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

So 5 times that is approximately 4.33.

So the total expectation is -5 +4.33 = -0.67, which is approximately -0.7.

So the correct answer is option C) -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in the state \( \psi \) are \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), respectively. The probabilities are:

\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(1) + |b|^2(-1) = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

Thus, \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) swaps the components of the state. For a general state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = a b + b a = 2ab.
\]

Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2(0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

Thus, \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the result is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The closest option is **C) -0.7**.
