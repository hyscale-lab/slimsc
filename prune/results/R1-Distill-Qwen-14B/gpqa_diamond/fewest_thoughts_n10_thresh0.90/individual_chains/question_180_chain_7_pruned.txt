Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. I remember that when dealing with electric charges, the potential energy between them comes into play. But wait, how does that work exactly?

So the problem states that there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The system is isolated, so energy won't be exchanged with the surroundings.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. So the setup is that one charge is at the center, and twelve are arranged around it, each 2 meters away. I think I need to calculate the potential energy of this configuration.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics is usually calculated using the formula for the potential energy between point charges. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, right? But when there are multiple charges, you have to consider each pair's contribution to the total potential energy. Oh, but wait, for a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But that could get complicated because you have to sum over all possible pairs.

In this case, there are 13 charges. But twelve are at fixed positions relative to the thirteenth. So maybe I can break this down into two parts: the potential energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the twelve surrounding charges, and the potential energy between the twelve surrounding charges themselves.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy. Hmm, when charges are placed around a central charge, the potential energy depends on how they're arranged. But wait, the twelve are constrained to stay at a fixed distance from P. So they can't move closer or farther from P, but their arrangement around P might affect their mutual potential energy. But the problem doesn't specify their positions relative to each other, just that they're each 2 meters from P. So I think they're all at the same distance from P, but maybe arranged in some symmetrical way. But for potential energy between them, the arrangement would matter because the distance between each surrounding charge could vary.

Wait, but the problem says the system is isolated, and the twelve are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps the positions of the twelve are fixed in space relative to P, but maybe not all at the same point. Oh, but the problem says 'constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P'. So each of the twelve is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but where exactly? They could be arranged in a sphere, perhaps. So each is 2 meters from P, but the distance between any two surrounding charges depends on their arrangement.

Hmm, but the problem might be assuming that the mutual potential energy between the surrounding charges can be ignored or maybe it's zero if they're all symmetrically placed. Wait, no, that's not right. If the surrounding charges are all identical and placed symmetrically, their mutual potential would contribute. But wait, if all twelve are identical and placed symmetrically, perhaps the potential energy between each pair is the same. So maybe I can calculate the potential energy between each pair and sum them all.

Wait, but the fixed charge is at P, so the potential energy between the central charge and each of the twelve is the same. So let's think: the potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge would be U_central = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m). Wait, but wait, no, the central charge is fixed, so each surrounding charge is 2 meters away. So each has a charge of 2e, and the central charge is also 2e. So the potential energy for each pair would be U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, but wait, Coulomb's law for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * q1 q2 / r. So each of the twelve charges contributes this amount.

Wait, but wait, when you have a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But I have to be careful about whether I'm counting each pair only once or twice. Because each pair is considered once, so for n charges, the number of unique pairs is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2.

But in this case, the configuration has one central charge and twelve surrounding. So for the potential energy, it's the sum of the energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge, plus the sum of the energy between each pair of surrounding charges.

So U_total = U_central + U_surrounding_pairs.

So let's compute each part.

First, U_central: each of the twelve charges is at 2 meters from the central charge. So each contributes U_i = k*( (2e) * (2e) ) / (2m). So U_i = k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

Since there are twelve such charges, U_central = 12 * (2k e²/m) ) = 24 k e² / m.

Now, the U_surrounding_pairs: each of the twelve charges is at a distance from each other. But what's the distance between any two surrounding charges? Hmm, if all twelve are at a distance of 2 meters from P, and assuming they are points on a sphere of radius 2 m, then the distance between any two points on the sphere depends on the angle between them. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to calculate their mutual distances. But wait, the problem might assume that the surrounding charges are placed such that they form a regular dodecahedron or something else, but perhaps it's arranged so that each pair is at the same distance. But that's only possible if all twelve are on a sphere with equal spacing, but wait, in three dimensions, twelve points equally spaced might not form a regular polyhedron. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is needed. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy can be considered in a way that each pair contributes a certain amount, but given that the problem doesn't specify their exact arrangement, maybe we can model it as a spherical arrangement where the average distance is considered. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants to ignore the mutual interaction because the surrounding charges are fixed and their positions effectively make their mutual potential energy zero? No, that doesn't make sense because they have the same charge and would repel each other, so their potential energy would be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the potential energy between the central charge and the surrounding charges, and not the mutual potential energies between the surrounding charges. Because if the surrounding charges are fixed, perhaps their mutual energy is considered as part of the constraints, meaning that the work done to bring them to their positions already includes their mutual repulsion. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the energy between the central charge and the surrounding, not the mutual energies. But that might not be correct, as the mutual potential energies would contribute to the total potential energy.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps we can arrange the surrounding charges in such a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized. Since they all have the same charge (2e, which is positive), they repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, the charges should be as far apart as possible given the constraint that they are each 2 meters from P. So perhaps arranging them on a sphere with maximum possible separation. But without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky to compute the sum of all mutual potentials.

Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the energy from the central charge. But I don't think that's a safe assumption. Let's think about the numbers.

Wait, maybe the mutual potential energy isn't necessary because the problem is designed in a way that it's only considering the central charge and the surrounding charges, not their interactions. But the options suggest that the correct answer is about 1e-26 J or so. Let me think:

Let me compute the U_central part first.

Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

Elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

So each surrounding charge is 2e, so 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

The central charge is also 2e, same as the others.

Each of these charges contributes a potential energy U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m).

Wait, wait, the distance between the central charge and each surrounding is 2 meters. So r=2 m.

So U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2.

So U_i = k * (4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Since there are twelve surrounding charges, U_central = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, let me compute that.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Then 4 e² = 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.026e-37 C².

Then each U_i = k * (4e²)/(2) → since r is 2 meters, each U_i = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2. So that's (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.602e-19)^2) / 2.

Wait, but wait, (2e)*(2e) is 4e². So each U_i is (k * 4e²) / (2), which is (k * 4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Wait, no, because each U_i is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 meters) = k * (4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So each U_i is 2 k e².

So for 12 charges, U_central = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

So let's compute that.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 24 * k * e² = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute that step by step.

24 * 8.988e9 = 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Then multiply by 2.566e-38:

2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.566) * 10^(11-38) = let's compute 2.15712 * 2.566 ≈ 5.546.

So 5.546e-27 J.

Wait, wait, that's 5.546e-27 J? But let me check my calculations again.

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 = ?

24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988 = 215.712, so 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Then 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.566) * 1e-27.

Wait, because 1e11 * 1e-38 = 1e-27.

2.15712 * 2.566: let's compute that.

2*2.566 is 5.132, 0.15712 * 2.566 ≈ approx 0.404.

So total is about 5.536.

So U_central ≈ 5.536e-27 J.

But wait, the options are in the 1e-26 range. Oh, but wait, I might have made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me compute 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988 is 215.712, so 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Then 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.566) * 1e11-38 = 5.546 * 1e-27 = 5.546e-27 J.

Hmm, that's 5.546e-27 J for U_central.

But wait, the question is, is that the total energy? Because I'm only considering the potential energies between the central charge and the surrounding ones.

Wait, but what about the potential energies between the surrounding charges themselves? Each pair of surrounding charges contributes some potential energy. So if I neglect that, I might be missing part of the total energy.

So the total potential energy would be the sum of all pairs, including the central charge and the surrounding ones, and all the pairs among the surrounding ones.

So, the potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge is 24 k e², as calculated.

Now, the potential between each pair of surrounding charges. Each surrounding charge is 2e, so each pair contributes U = k * (2e) * (2e) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two surrounding charges.

But since the surrounding charges are all at 2 meters from P, their mutual distances would vary. Wait, but if they're arranged in a spherical shell, each at radius 2 m, the average distance between two points on the sphere is a certain value. But without knowing the exact positions, perhaps the problem expects us to neglect their mutual interactions, or maybe to assume that the distance between any two surrounding charges is much larger than 2 meters, but that's not the case, because the maximum possible distance between two points on a sphere of radius 2 m is 4 m (diametrically opposite), but the minimum is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potentials are negligible compared to the central potential, but that doesn't seem right because the charges are the same and repel, so their mutual potential would be positive, adding to the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is set in such a way that the mutual potential energy is zero because the charges are constrained in a way that their mutual potential is considered part of the fixed setup. Hmm, that's possible. Or perhaps the problem is designed so that the mutual potential is ignored, considering only the central charge's contribution.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A) 5.645e-26 J
Option B) 2.822e-26 J
Option C) 7.056e-27 J
Option D) 122.330 J

Wait, my U_central was about 5.546e-27 J, which is approximately 5.5e-27 J. But option C is about 7.056e-27 J, which is roughly 7e-27, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recalculate U_central more carefully.

Each U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m) = k * (4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So for each of the 12 surrounding charges, it's 2 k e².

So 12 * 2 = 24, so 24 k e².

Let me compute 24 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² = (1.602e-19 C)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988 = 215.712, so 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38:

2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.566) * 1e(11-38) = (5.546) * 1e-27 = 5.546e-27 J.

So U_central is approximately 5.546e-27 J.

But wait, none of the options exactly match this. The options are A) 5.645e-26, which is ten times larger. B) 2.822e-26, about five times larger. C)7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times larger than 5.5e-27. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for something. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says 12 of the charges are at 2 m from P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2 meters from P. The central charge is at P.

So the distance between the central charge and each surrounding charge is 2 m. So each contributes U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = 2 k e².

Wait, but wait, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

So U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = k*(4e²)/2 = 2 k e².

Yes, that's correct. So 12 of these would be 24 k e².

So when I compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2, wait, no, wait:

Wait, e² is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38. So 4e² is 1.026e-37.

So each U_i = k*(4e²)/(2 m) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e². So 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Wait, but let me compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 24 * 8.988e9 * (2.566e-38) = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 first.

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 is 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiplying them:

8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's compute 8 * 2.566 = 20.528, 0.988 * 2.566≈ about 2.532. So total ≈23.06.

Then 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28.

Now multiply by 24: 24 * 2.306e-28 = 55.344e-28 = 5.5344e-27 J.

Which is about 5.534e-27 J.

So U_central ≈5.534e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C) 7.056e-27, which is about 20% higher. So that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of terms. Let me recheck.

Wait, each of the surrounding 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the central charge, so each contributes a potential energy of U = k*(2e)(2e)/(2) = 2 k e². So 12 terms, each 2 k e². So 12 * 2 = 24. So yes, 24 k e².

Wait, but perhaps the problem considers the central charge and the other charges, but in potential energy, when you have a system of charges, you have to sum all possible pairs. However, in this case, the central charge is fixed, and the surrounding are fixed in position, so the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. The central charge with each surrounding charge, and all the surrounding charges with each other.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy, so perhaps the system's potential is minimized when the surrounding charges are placed as far apart as possible, so their mutual potential energy is minimized (since like charges repel, so higher potential energy when closer, lower when farther. Wait, no: the potential energy for two positive charges is positive, and increases as they come closer. So to minimize potential energy, you would arrange them as far apart as possible, but in this case, their positions are fixed at 2 m from P. So how does that affect their mutual distance?

Wait, but the problem states that the twelve charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed in space at that radius, but their exact arrangement around P can vary. So to minimize the total potential energy, we need to arrange them such that the sum of their mutual potential energies is as small as possible. Since all the surrounding charges are positive, their mutual potential energies are positive, so to minimize the total, we need to arrange them as far apart as possible.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because all the charges are positive and repel each other. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered negligible compared to the central charge's contribution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not being considered in the problem, and the answer only includes the central charge's contribution. But in that case, the calculated U_central is about 5.5e-27 J, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the calculation. Let me recalculate the U_central more accurately.

Let me compute 24 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 *8.988 = 215.712, so 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Now, 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Multiply the coefficients:

2.15712 * 2.566 = let's compute this accurately.

2 * 2.566 = 5.132.

0.15712 * 2.566 = let's compute:

0.15712 * 2 = 0.31424.

0.15712 * 0.566 = let's compute 0.15712 * 0.5 = 0.07856, 0.15712 * 0.066 = ~0.01035.

So total 0.07856 + 0.01035 = 0.08891. So 0.15712 * 0.566 ≈ 0.08891.

Adding to the 0.31424 gives 0.31424 + 0.08891 ≈ 0.40315.

So total 5.132 + 0.40315 = 5.53515.

So 5.53515e-27 J.

So U_central ≈5.535e-27 J.

Still, that's about 5.5e-27 J.

But the available options don't include that. Let me look again:

Option C is 7.056e-27 J. Hmm, that's about 27% higher than my result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me think again. The central charge is 2e, and each surrounding is 2e. So each pair between the central charge and a surrounding charge contributes U= k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = 2 k e². So 12 of them, so 24 k e².

Wait, correct. So perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge, but the surrounding charges are all together.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of the potential energies of each surrounding charge when brought from infinity to their position. In that case, each surrounding charge contributes U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = 2 k e². So 12 charges, 24 k e².

Hmm.

But looking at the options, none of them match 5.5e-27 J. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So 8.988e9 is correct.

e is 1.602e-19 C. Correct.

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, wait, (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38, right.

So, 24 * 8.988e9 = 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38:

2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.566) * 1e(11-38) = 5.535e-27 J.

Which is 5.535e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. Only option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is roughly 1.27 times higher.

Wait, 5.535e-27 * 1.27 ≈ 7.05e-27.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 1.27 somewhere, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.

The problem says each charge is 2e. So each charge is 2e, so when considering the central charge and a surrounding charge, it's (2e)*(2e) =4e². Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of the entire system as the sum of all pairs, which includes the central charge and each surrounding charge, and all the surrounding charges in pairs.

Wait, but if I include all the surrounding pairs, that's (12 choose 2) = 66 pairs.

Each of these pairs contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(r_ij).

But without knowing r_ij for each pair, we can't compute the exact sum. However, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distance between any two surrounding charges is 2 meters, which would be incorrect because if they are all 2m from P, their mutual distances would vary, but perhaps the problem simplifies it by assuming that each pair is 2 meters apart. But that would be a very tight arrangement, but perhaps in the problem's context, it's assumed.

If that's the case, then each surrounding pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / 2 = 2k e². And there are (12 *11)/2 = 66 pairs.

So the mutual potential energy would be 66 * 2 k e² = 132 k e².

Adding that to the U_central which was 24 k e², the total U_total = 24 k e² + 132 k e² = 156 k e².

So 156 k e².

Let me compute that.

156 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

156 * 8.988e9 = 156 * 8.988 = let's see: 100*8.988=898.8, 50*8.988=449.4, 6*8.988=53.928. So 898.8 + 449.4 = 1348.2 +53.928= 1402.128. So 1402.128e9 = 1.402128e1
