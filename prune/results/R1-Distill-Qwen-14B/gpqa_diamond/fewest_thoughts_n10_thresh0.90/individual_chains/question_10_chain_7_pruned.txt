Okay, so I need to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density among the options a to d. Hmm, let's think about what I know about density and planets.

Density is mass divided by volume, right? So the formula is density = mass/volume. For planets, especially rocky ones like Earth, their density depends on their mass and radius because the volume is determined by the radius.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, so this should be the same as Earth. I remember Earth is pretty dense because it's mostly rock and metal.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the density is given here. So unless the volume is different, the density is fixed. But if the mass is more and the density is the same, then the volume must be larger. So the volume would be mass/(density) → 2 Earth masses /5.5. But since Earth's density is 5.5, Earth's volume is (Earth mass)/5.5. So this planet's volume would be 2 Earth masses divided by 5.5, which is twice the Earth's volume. That means the radius would be larger, but the question is about density, which is already given as 5.5, same as Earth. So this planet has the same density as Earth. So its density isn't higher than some others maybe?

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The density is given, so it's 5.5. So this planet's density is same as Earth. So it's not higher than Earth—so not the highest.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition means same density, right? Because composition affects density. So Earth is made of certain materials, so if a planet has the same composition, its density should be the same as Earth. So if this planet is 5 times more massive, but same density, then its volume is 5 times that of Earth. But since volume scales with radius cubed, its radius would be larger, but the density is same as Earth. So its density is 5.5, same as Earth, same as option a and b. So not higher than others.

Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass
