Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Hmm, normalization... right, the wave function must satisfy the condition that the total probability of finding the particle in all space is 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, that's interesting. So the wave function ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, I thought wave functions are usually complex, so that makes sense because of the 'i' term. But when we take the absolute square, the imaginary parts might play a role.

But wait, the question says that when measuring the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this interval? Or perhaps, the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. Oh, because the wave function is given as ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i, but only in the region where x is between 1 and 3. So outside that, it's zero? Or maybe it's non-zero only between 1 and 3, so the wave function is zero elsewhere.

Wait, no, the question says when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 or x>3. So that means the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval, implying that the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So within that region, the given expression holds, and it's zero elsewhere.

But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. To normalize it, we need to integrate the absolute square from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

So the absolute square is |ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x), where * denotes the complex conjugate.

So first, let's write ψ(x) as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i
