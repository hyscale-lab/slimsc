Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, the formula they're giving is something like N ∝ 1/ plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in some way. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d = 1/plx.

Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, per unit range of distance, r. So I need to find how N depends on r.

Let me think about the relationships here. Since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then plx = 1/d. So substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that.

1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance, right? So I think that's the differential. Like, how N changes as r (distance) changes. So maybe we need to find dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about how the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r increases with r. Because as you go further away, the number of stars in a given volume (like a shell) might change in a certain way.

Wait, but the given relationship is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me get back to that. So N is proportional to d^5, because 1/plx is d. So N ∝ d^5. 

But wait, if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But wait, does that make sense? Because as you look further away, the density of stars would decrease, but the volume increases, so the number depends on how these factors balance.

Wait, but the question's setup says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So let's model this. Let's say N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, replacing that in, N ∝ (d)^5.

But wait, the number of stars (N) in a region would depend on the volume. Typically, the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume, which is proportional to r^3. But here, it's saying N is proportional to d^5, which is more than the usual volume scaling. Hmm, maybe this is a specific scenario where other factors are at play, like the star distribution or how observable stars change with distance.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Maybe the number of stars observed with a particular parallax varies as 1/(plx)^5. So when you look at stars with a certain parallax (plx), the number you see is N = k / (plx)^5, where k is a constant.

But parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. Substituting, N = k * (d)^5. So the number of stars at a distance d is proportional to d^5. But wait, that seems a bit odd because as d increases, the number of stars would be increasing. But in reality, when you look further away, you can see more stars, but perhaps not as quickly as d^5. Unless the star density is increasing, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So perhaps the number of stars in a region (per unit volume) is being considered. Or maybe the number per unit distance.

Wait, the wording is: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".
