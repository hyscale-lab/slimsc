Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a given spin state. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, that notation—so the spin state vector must be a two-component vector since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles. So I'll represent the state as a column vector: [3i, 4]^T. Oh wait, wait, but when writing vectors, sometimes the order is different. Let me make sure I have the state correctly. The given state is (3i, 4). So in vector form, that's top component 3i, bottom component 4.

The question asks for the expectation value of S_y. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product of the state with the operator acting on the state. So in formula terms, <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ℏ ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, and ℏ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, wait, hold on. The Pauli matrices are represented in terms of their matrix elements. The σ_y matrix is given as:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So, the spin operator S_y is (ℏ/2) σ_y. Oh right, because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are S = (ℏ/2) σ, where σ is the respective Pauli matrix. So S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y.

So the expectation value is <ψ| S_y |ψ> which would be (ℏ/2) times <ψ| σ_y |ψ>.

So let's compute <ψ| σ_y |ψ>.

First, let's write the state ψ as a column vector. ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

The bra vector ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which would be [ -3 (since 3i* is -3i?), wait no, wait. Wait, ψ† is [3i*, 4*]. Since 3i is a complex number, its conjugate is -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† σ_y ψ is ψ† multiplied by σ_y multiplied by ψ.

Let me compute σ_y ψ first. σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

So when I multiply σ_y by ψ (which is [3i; 4]), I get:

First element: 0 * 3i + (-i) *4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.
Second element: i * 3i + 0 *4 = 3i² + 0. i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.
So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, ψ† multiplied by σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, ψ† is a row vector, σ_y ψ is a column vector, so their product is the inner product.

So the product is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Let me calculate each term.

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So adding them gives -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because when I multiply a row vector and a column vector, each element is multiplied and summed. So for the first term, it's (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12. Second term is 4 * (-3) = -12. So total is -12 + (-12) = -24. So ψ† σ_y ψ = -24.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when I multiplied σ_y by ψ, I got [ -4i, -3 ]. Then when I multiply ψ† (which is [ -3i, 4 ]) with that, I have:

(-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3).

Wait, let's re-calculate that.

(-3i)*(-4i) = (12) (i^2) = 12*(-1) = -12.

(4)*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ is -24.

Then the expectation value of S_y is (ℏ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ℏ)/2 = -12 ℏ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the given choices are in terms of hbar. Let me check the options.

Options are:

A) -12 hbar /25

B) 12 hbar /25

C) 25 hbar /2

D) -25 hbar /2

Wait wait, but I'm getting -12 hbar. But none of the options match that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, let's go back and check each step.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the order of multiplication. Because maybe I should have calculated σ_y ψ correctly.

Wait ψ is [3i;4]. So σ_y is:

Row 1: 0 and -i.

Row 2: i and 0.

So σ_y * ψ would be:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*(4) = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

Yes, that's correct. So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ].

Then ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† times σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. The first element is (row of ψ†) times (column of σ_y ψ).

Wait, more accurately, the inner product is (a*, b*) times (c, d) = a*c + b*d.

So in this case, a = -3i, c = -4i.

b =4, d = -3.

So a*c = (-3i)*(-4i) = (12) (i^2) = 12*(-1) = -12.

b*d = 4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -24.

Wait, that's correct. So expectation value is (ℏ/2)*(-24) = -12 ℏ.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the state vector. Or perhaps I messed up the order of multiplication.

Wait, perhaps I got the state vector wrong. The problem says the spin state is (3i,4). So the state vector is (3i,4), which is a column vector: [3i,4]^T. But in quantum mechanics, the state is often written as a column vector, and the bra is the conjugate transpose.

Wait, but wait a second. The state is given as (3i,4). So |ψ> is [3i,4]^T.

Wait, but when I compute <ψ| σ_y |ψ>, perhaps I should have done it correctly. So let's compute it again.

Compute σ_y |ψ> first:

As before, σ_y |ψ> = [ -4i, -3 ].

Then <ψ| σ_y |ψ> = [3i*,4*] [ -4i, -3 ].

3i* is -3i. 4* is 4.

So [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Sum is -24.

So expectation value is (ℏ/2)*(-24) = -12 ℏ.

But the options don't have -12 ℏ. They have -12 ℏ/25 and others.

Wait, maybe the state is not normalized. Because the state given is (3i,4), which has a norm squared of |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. So the state is not normalized. Oh wait, that's a crucial point. Because the expectation value is calculated as <ψ| O |ψ> divided by <ψ | ψ> only if the state is not normalized. Wait, no, wait: the expectation value is (ψ† O ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ) if the state isn't normalized. Oh wait, no. Wait, the expectation value is <O> = (ψ† O ψ) / (ψ† ψ) when ψ isn't normalized. Because the state vector should be normalized to 1. So in this case, the state has a norm squared of 25, so the norm is 5. So to get the expectation value correctly, I should normalize it.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the state is given as (3i,4). So perhaps it's normalized? Let me check: |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25, so the norm is 5. So the state is |ψ>
