Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the possible decays of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think I might have misread that. Oh right, probably it's L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. So, the interaction term involves the boson X and some fermions.

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. The options are A to D, each listing different possible decay channels.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have enough energy, right? So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of each of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because for a decay X → ff̄, each fermion must have at least their rest mass. So the mass of X must be ≥ 2m_f.

But wait, what is the mass of each possible fermion? Let me list the known fermion masses:

Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV (since 1 GeV is about 1.6e-10 J, but in terms of mass, it's about 0.511 MeV, so 0.000511 GeV). 

Muon (μ): around 0.105 GeV.

Tau (τ): about 1.777 GeV.

Quarks: up (u), down (d) are light, but their actual masses are tricky because of confinement. But in many cases, especially in high-energy physics, we take the current quark masses. So u and d are about a few MeV—like u is around 2 MeV, d around 5 MeV. But when considering decay products, sometimes people consider constituent masses, but I think for decay kinematics, the relevant mass is the rest mass. But wait, maybe in this context, the fermions are considered massless or have negligible masses compared to the boson? Because for a 6 GeV boson, even if the fermions have a few GeV masses, 2 times that may matter.

Wait, wait, the quarks like charm (c) are around 1.5-2 GeV each. Bottom (b) is about 4.5 GeV. Top (t) is around 173 GeV. But since X is only 6 GeV, top quarks are out of the question because 2*173 is way bigger than 6 GeV.

So let's list possible fermions and their masses:

- e: 0.0005 GeV (negligible)
- μ: ~0.105 GeV
- τ: ~1.777 GeV
- u, d: very light, maybe 2 MeV and 5 MeV, so 2m ~ 0.01 GeV each
- s: strange quark—about 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- c: ~1.5 GeV
- b: ~4.5 GeV
- t: way too heavy, 173 GeV

So for the decay X → f f̄, the threshold is 2m_f.

So for each possible f, check if 2m_f <= 6 GeV.

Let's go through each option:

Option A) X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, e⁺e⁻

Check each:

b: 4.5 GeV each. 2*4.5 =9 GeV. X is 6 GeV. So 6 <9 → kinematically not allowed. So b b̄ decay is not possible. So option A is incorrect.

Option B) X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻

Check each:

c: 1.5 GeV each. 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6 → allowed.

s: 0.1 GeV. 2*0.1=0.2 ≤6 → allowed.

u: 2 MeV, 2*2=4 MeV <<6 → allowed.

d: 5 MeV → same as u.

τ: 1.777 GeV each. 2*1.777=3.554 ≤6 → allowed.

μ: 0.105 GeV → 0.21 <<6 → allowed.

e: same, negligible.

So all these in option B are allowed. But what about the quarks? Because in the Lagrangian, the interaction is with ψ_f, which probably refers to fermion fields. But let's think about what fermions can be produced.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. So it's a Yukawa-like interaction, where X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So which fermions are involved? The problem states that the interaction is with fermions f, but what are the possible f's?

Wait, the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So ψ_f is a fermion field. So the decay depends on what fermions X can interact with.

But the Lagrangian doesn't specify which fermions, but the possible options list a variety of fermions. So perhaps the fermions are all possible quarks and leptons.

Wait, but the problem is about kinematically allowed decays, regardless of the strength (since it's about lowest order, which probably just means tree-level decays, so selection rules based on the Lagrangian like whether the coupling exists).

Wait, but the question is only about kinematics, not about whether the coupling exists. Because the problem states the interaction is given, so perhaps all the fermions in the options are possible decay channels, assuming the coupling exists.

Wait, but no, the problem statement says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, but the fermions f could be any, but in reality, in the Standard Model, X would couple to certain fermions. But perhaps the problem is assuming that X can decay into any fermion as long as kinematically allowed, regardless of what the Lagrangian says.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is given, so the interaction terms determine which fermions are allowed. The interaction term is λ f \bar{ψ}_f X ψ_f, because the v is probably a constant and the X is a field. So this term implies that X couples to ψ_f. So ψ_f would be the fermion fields.

But in reality, the fermions could be any of the leptons or quarks, but the coupling depends on whether the term exists. But the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so the fermions that can interact are those that ψ_f can be. So all fermions in the Lagrangian's ψ_f are possible decay channels. But wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = ... So the interaction is with any fermion ψ_f, but the problem is about the possible decays, which depend on the mass.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is about the possible decay products regardless of the specific fermions in the Lagrangian. Because the options include different fermions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all possible fermions, so the possible decay channels are all fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

But the X can decay into any such pair, provided the Lagrangian allows it. So the options list the possible decay channels, and we need to pick those that are allowed kinematically.

So let's go back to the kinematic condition.

Each of the fermions in the options must have 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So for each option, let's check:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

c: 2*1.5=3 ≤6 → allowed.

s: 2*0.1=0.2 ≤6 → allowed.

u: 2*0.002=0.004 → allowed.

d: 2*0.005=0.01 → allowed.

tau: 2*1.777=3.554 ≤6 → allowed.

mu: 0.21 ≤6 → allowed.

e: negligible.

So all of these are allowed. So Option B is possible.

Option C: c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e.

Wait, top quark (t) has mass ~173 GeV, 2*173 is way above 6 GeV. So t t̄ decay is not allowed. So Option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Check b: 2*4.5=9>6 → kinematically not allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the only correct option is B, but wait, let me recheck.

Wait, what about the X boson's mass? It's 6 GeV. So for each possible fermion pair, 2m_f must be ≤6 GeV.

So, for each fermion in the decay option:

Option B includes c (3 GeV), which is allowed. s (0.2), yes. u (0.004), yes. d (0.01), yes. tau (3.554), yes. mu (0.21), yes. e (0.001), yes.

So all of these are below 6 GeV, so they are allowed.

But wait, what about the quark masses? Because in reality, for quarks, since they are confined, do they even appear as decay products? Hmm, well, the question is about the possible decay channels, assuming that X can decay into quarks. But in reality, if X is a gauge boson, it might only decay into charged particles, but I think the problem is more about whether the mass allows the decay, regardless of other factors like confinement.

But the problem states that the interaction is given, so perhaps the fermions are all possible, including quarks. So for the purpose of this question, assuming that X can decay into quarks as well as leptons.

So, looking at the options, B is the only one that includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Does it have any fermions that would be too heavy?

Wait, in option B, the fermions are c (allowed), s (allowed), u (allowed), d (allowed), tau (allowed), mu (allowed), e (allowed). So all are allowed kinematically.

Wait, what about the tau? 2m_tau is about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6, so allowed.

So option B is correct. But looking back, option B has c, which is okay. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me check: in the given Lagrangian, is there any reason that X can't decay into certain fermions? Like, for example, if the interaction is only with charged leptons or something?

Wait, the Lagrangian term is -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. So ψ_f could be any fermion. So the X couples to all the fermions. So all possible fermions are allowed, regardless of whether they are quarks or leptons. So in this case, the only limitation is the mass.

So, all the fermions in the options except those too heavy would be allowed.

So, the correct options would be those that only include fermions with 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So, for each option:

Option A: includes b, which is too heavy. So A is incorrect.

Option B: all fermions are allowed. Correct.

Option C: includes t, which is too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

Hence, the correct answer must be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The kinematic condition for a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) is that the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion \( f \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). The fermion masses are as follows:

- \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- \( m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV} \) (negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy for \( X \))

The interaction term in the Lagrangian implies that \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the kinematic condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) is satisfied. The analysis of each option is as follows:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), where \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is kinematically forbidden. Hence, Option A is incorrect.

- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+e^- \). For all these fermions, \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so all decays are kinematically allowed. Hence, Option B is correct.

- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), where \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is kinematically forbidden. Hence, Option C is incorrect.

- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), where \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is kinematically forbidden. Hence, Option D is incorrect.

Thus, the only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are listed in **Option B**.
