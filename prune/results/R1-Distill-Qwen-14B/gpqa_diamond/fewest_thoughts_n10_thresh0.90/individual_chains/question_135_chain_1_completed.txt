Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. Since X is a boson field and the fermions are ψ_f, the interaction is between the boson and these fermions.

So the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The key point here is to figure out which fermions are kinematically allowed. Kinematically allowed means that the rest mass of the fermion must be less than or equal to half the mass of X because, in the center-of-mass frame, each fermion would carry away some energy, and the maximum mass they can have is when they are at rest.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, each fermion in the pair has a mass m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Wait, let me list the known fermion masses. Quarks are a bit tricky because they come in different flavors, and the masses can vary. But generally, the up and down quarks are the lightest, followed by the strange, then the charm, bottom, top, and so on. But wait, let's get exact numbers.

From what I remember:

- Up quark: ~2 MeV (so way below 3 GeV)
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV (I think around 100 MeV)
- Charm quark: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark: way heavier, like ~173 GeV, so way beyond our limit.

Leptons:

- Electron: ~0.5 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are super light, but I don't think they're considered here since the interaction is with ψ_f, which I'm guessing refers to charged leptons or quarks.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is written as λf f(y) ... ψf(y). Oh, maybe ψ_f is a fermion field, perhaps a charged lepton or a quark. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion's mass allows it.

So, all fermions with mass ≤ 3 GeV can be decay products. Let's see which particles fit.

Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV — that's under 3 GeV. So c and cbar would be allowed. Same for up, down, strange, but wait, wait. Wait, the mass of the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3. So bottom quarks are out. So X can't decay into b and bbar because 2*4.5 =9 GeV >6 GeV. So option A has b and anti-b, which is probably not allowed.

Wait, but the X is 6 GeV. So for a fermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Each fermion is m, so 2m ≤ 6 → m ≤ 3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass ≤ 3 GeV can be produced. Let's list the possible fermions.

Quarks:

- Up (u): m ~2 MeV → allowed
- Down (d): ~5 MeV → allowed
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV → allowed
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV → allowed
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV → not allowed
- Top (t): way too heavy.

Charged leptons:

- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV → allowed
- Muon (μ): ~105 MeV → allowed
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV → allowed
- Neutrinos are too light, but since the Lagrangian involves ψ_f, which I'm assuming are charged leptons and quarks, so neutrinos might not be considered here.

So possible fermion pairs are uū, dđ, sī, cē , as well as e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Wait, but the bottom quark is too heavy, so b is out. So any decay products that include b would not be allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b bbar etc. So this can't be right because m_b is about 4.5 GeV. So X can't decay into b and anti-b because 4.5 * 2 =9 GeV>6 GeV.

Option B: Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Wait, but does it have c? Let me check. It says c and others. But does the interaction allow for all these? So the Lagrangian is written as involving ψ_f, which is a fermion, but perhaps only specific ones. Wait, but the problem states that the interaction is given, so it's not limited to certain fermions. So any fermion that meets the mass condition can be produced.

Wait, but the interaction term is written as λf f(y) ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I should parse that. Wait, the term is -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψf(y). So perhaps f here is the Yukawa coupling index, and ψf is the fermion field.

Wait, maybe the structure is that X can interact with any fermion ψ_f, so it's a generic interaction. So all possible fermion species are allowed, provided their mass is under 3 GeV.

So the possible decay channels would be any fermion pair where each has mass ≤3 GeV.

So, the allowed fermions are:

- u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ. Because their masses are all under 3 GeV.

Wait, but the tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. So yes, tau pairs are allowed.

So the decay products should include all of e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, uū, dđ, sī, cē.

Looking at the options:

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. So that's all these except for b, which is excluded.

Option C includes top quarks, which are too heavy. So C is out.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Option A includes b, so wrong.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the fermion masses. Let me list them again:

u: ~2 MeV
d: ~5 MeV
s: ~100 MeV
c: ~1.5 GeV
b: ~4.7 GeV
t: ~173 GeV
e: 0.5 MeV
mu: ~105 MeV
tau: ~1.78 GeV

So yes, all except b are under 3 GeV. So any pair of these would be allowed.

So the allowed decay products are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, option B says: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So that's all the allowed ones.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided, 

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f f(y) (\bar{\psi}_f (y) + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the total rest mass of the decay products must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \sim 5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, far exceeding the limit)

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed)
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)

Thus, the boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs for all quarks and leptons with masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), specifically \( u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed as \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
