Okay, so I've got this question about which planet is more likely to transit, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, let's read the question carefully.

So, there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. Also, their host stars have the same radii, but the mass of Planet_1's star is twice that of Planet_2's. 

Hmm, okay. So the main thing here is figuring out which planet has a higher chance of transiting. I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh, right, and the orbital period might influence how often we can observe the transit, but in this case, since they're asking about the probability, I think it's about the geometric probability of a transit occurring, not the frequency.

The geometric probability formula I recall is something like (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by some other factors? Or wait, no, wait, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s)² times (something else). Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. 

The transit probability (the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view) is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star to the planet. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Oh, right, the formula is [ (R_p + R_s) / a ] where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that's the duration of the transit or something else. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the geometric probability is given by (R_p / a)^2, but wait, no. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R_s / a)^2, but I'm not sure. Hmm. Maybe I should look up the formula again in my notes. Oh wait, in this scenario, I can't look anything up, so I have to rely on what I remember.

I think the formula for the probability P of a transit is given by:

P = (R_p + R_s) / a 

Wait no, that can't be right because if a is the semi-major axis, which is much larger than the star's radius, then (R_p + R_s) would be much smaller than a, making P less than 1, which makes sense because transits are rare. But wait, actually, I think the correct formula is (R_p / a)^2 * (something else). Or maybe it's (R_p + R_s) / a divided by (something), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star relative to the orbit. So, a larger planet around a smaller star would
