Okay, so I have this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. So, the area of a surface would involve integrating the appropriate form over the surface.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Oh, right, pseudospheres are like two-dimensional surfaces in a higher-dimensional space, maybe. But wait, the metric here looks like it's in two dimensions because it's got dx² and dy². So maybe it's a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some space.

The metric's denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Oh, that looks familiar. If I rearrange that, 4 - x² - y² = 4 - (x² + y²). So, that would be like 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So, the denominator is 4 - r² where r² = x² + y². Interesting.

But wait, what's the condition on r? The denominator can't be zero because that would make the metric singular. So, 4 - r² > 0. So, r² <4, which means r <2. Hmm, because r is a radius, but in this case, the maximum r is 2. So the radius of the pseudosphere is 2, maybe?

So, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), if I switch to polar coordinates. Because in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So, the line element becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric. So, the surface it describes is two-dimensional. Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So, I think we need to compute the area of this surface when the radius is 2.

Wait, but pseudospheres are usually considered in higher dimensions, but maybe in this case, it's a 2D surface. Or perhaps it's a 3D surface, but the metric is given in 2D coordinates. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric on a 2-sphere, but with a different scaling. The area in general relativity is found using the area element, which for a metric in spherical coordinates is sqrt(g_θθ g_φφ) dθ dφ, but wait, in this case, it's 2D, so similar approach.

Wait, the area for a surface described by a metric in polar coordinates would be the integral over r and θ (or φ, depending on how we set it up) of the square root of the determinant of the metric times the volume element. Wait, but for a 2D metric, the area is computed as the integral of dx dy times the square root of the determinant of the metric.

Wait, no, let's think again. The area element in 2D for a metric ds² = g_rr dr² + g_θθ dθ² is just sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ. So, the area would be the integral of sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ over the region in question.

In this case, our metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So, the g_rr component is 32/(4 - r²), and the g_θθ component is [32/(4 - r²)] * r². So, the determinant is (32/(4-r²)) * (32 r²/(4-r²)) ) which would be [32^2 r²] / (4 - r²)^2.

So, sqrt of the determinant is [32 r]/(4 - r²). Because sqrt(32^2 r²/(4-r²)^2) is 32r/(4 - r²).

Wait, but that's not right. Because the determinant of a diagonal metric is the product of the diagonal terms. So, if the metric is diag(g_rr, g_θθ), then determinant is g_rr * g_θθ. So, sqrt(det) would be sqrt(g_rr g_θθ).

So, g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²). So, the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

So sqrt(det) = (32 r)/(4 - r²).

Wait, no: sqrt of (
