Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Alright, let's read through the question again and see what each part is telling me.

The problem talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X must be a compound where one of the elements is present in a heavier isotope form. Then, it reacts violently with liquid Y, producing gas W, precipitate G, and releasing B upon heating G. 

Let me jot down the key points:

1. Substance X reacts with liquid Y → violent reaction.
2. Gas W is released. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, W is a molecule where protons = neutrons. That makes me think about common gases. Hmmm, maybe H2O, CO2, NH3... Wait, let me think. For a molecule, if each atom contributes, but wait, W's molecule (like O2 maybe?) but wait, O has atomic number 8, so O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons (if each O is 16O). But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe CO2? No, CO2 has 22 protons (each C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 2*8=22). Wait, but CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons? No, wait, the total number of neutrons in CO2 would be the sum of each atom's neutrons. C-12 has 6 neutrons, O-16 has 8 each. So CO2 would have 6 + 2*(8) = 22 neutrons. Protons: C has 6, each O has 8, so 6+16=22. So yeah, 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So CO2's molecule would have 22 each. So W could be CO2. But wait, another possibility is H2O. H2O has 2 H and 1 O. H has 1 proton, O has 8. So total protons: 2(1) + 8 = 10. Neutrons: H has 0 (assuming lightest isotope), O-16 has 8. So total neutrons: 2*(0) + 8 = 8. Wait, that's 10 protons and 8 neutrons, which aren't equal. So that doesn't fit. Another option: NH3? Let's see. N has 7 protons, each H has 1. So total protons:7 +3=10. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (for N-14), each H has 0. So 7 + 0 =7. 10 vs 7: not equal. Hmm, maybe CH4? C has 6, H each has 1. Protons:6+4=10. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, H has 0. So 6+0=6. 10 vs 6: nope. Maybe O2? O has 8 protons each. O2 has 16 protons. O-16 has 8 neutrons each, so O2 has 16 neutrons. So 16 each. That matches. So W could be O2. But wait, O2 is a diatomic gas, so yes, same protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule. Another thought: what about C2H2? Acetylene. It has 2 C (each 6) and 2 H (each 1) → protons: 2*6 + 2*1=14. Neutrons: C-12 (6), H has 0. So 2*6=12. 14 and 12: nope. How about something with same number, maybe with 22 each? Like CO2 as I thought earlier. Wait, if W is CO2, then it's a gas released. Let me think about the reaction. So X reacting with Y gives CO2 as gas.

Then, the precipitate G is formed. When heated, G releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C, which is the melting point of water (273 K is 0°C, so 277 is a bit higher, but close). Wait, no, 277 K is about 4°C, but water's melting point is 273.15 K. So maybe B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is ice? Because when ice melts, it's 273 K. Wait, the question says the melting point under normal conditions is close to 277 K. Hmm, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So maybe B is not water. Alternatively, maybe it's another substance. Wait, maybe B is something else. Let me think of other substances. Perhaps something like camphor? Or maybe another element. Or perhaps B is some oxide. Hmm, not sure yet.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which is a carboxylic acid and can undergo various reactions. But it's a keto acid, so perhaps it's something like pyruvic acid? Or maybe a ketone acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction like esterification, but that usually produces
