Okay, so I have this physics problem here about wave functions and particles in a tube. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says we have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but I remember that wave functions need to satisfy certain conditions, like being square-integrable and normalized. Oh right, normalization is important because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

The problem states that when measuring the position, none of the particles were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But wait, looking at the given wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That doesn't look like it's zero for x<1 or x>3. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function as written is only valid in the region where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside this region, the wave function is zero. But the expression given must be the part where it's non-zero.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, that seems a bit odd because typically, the wave function is a complex function, but the real and imaginary parts should be considered when normalizing. Or maybe the given expression is the entire wave function in the region x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere.

So the first thing I should do is normalize the wave function. The integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

The wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square is ψ*(x) * ψ(x), which is the product of the conjugate and the function itself.

Let me write this out. The absolute value squared |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] * [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ] because the conjugate of -0.5i is +0.5i.

Multiplying these out: (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b². So the cross terms cancel out.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1.

So integral = ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute that integral. Breaking it into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx + integral of 0.25 dx.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so the first part is a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3.

The second integral is 0.25*(3 -1) = 0.5.

So putting it together:

a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, because ln(4) is ln(3+1)=ln(4), and ln(2) is ln(1+1)=ln(2). So ln(4) - ln(2) is ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that's a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So rearranging:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a squared equals 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

Then a² ≈ 0.721, so a is the square root of that. Let's compute sqrt(0.721). Hmm, sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85, since 0.85^2 is 0.7225. So sqrt(0.721) is about 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. That's the value of a.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) is 1. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \right) \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i \right) = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), we have:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two integrals:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[ \ln(1+x) \right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left( \ln(4) - \ln(2) \right) = a^2 \ln(2). \)

2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5. \)

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
