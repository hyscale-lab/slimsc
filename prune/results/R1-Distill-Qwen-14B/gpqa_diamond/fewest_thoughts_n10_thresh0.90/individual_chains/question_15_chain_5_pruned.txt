Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They share the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so if Planet_1 has a shorter period, it's closer to its star, right?

The stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So even though the host of Planet_2 is more evolved, they're the same size. That probably affects their luminosity, but maybe not the transit probability directly.

The researchers want to choose the planet with the higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But wait, there's more to it. The probability also depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the distance of the planet from the star.

Wait, the transit probability (the chance that the planet will pass in front of the star from our viewpoint) is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), the formula simplifies to P = R_p / a, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis (which for a circular orbit is the distance from the star).

But wait, the question says both planets have Earth-like masses. Hmm, but transit probability depends more on the size of the planet relative to the star. Wait, no, wait: for a given planet size, a smaller star would have a higher transit probability because R_p/R_s is larger.

Wait, but the planets themselves have the same mass. But mass isn't directly the same as radius. Earth's mass is about 5.97e24 kg. But there are other factors. Oh wait, the host stars have the same radius, right? Because the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass but same radius as Planet_2's host.

So, R_star1 = R_star2, but M_star1 = 2 * M_star2.

But how does that affect the planet's semi-major axis? Oh, because the period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. The law is (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + m_planet)/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, it's approximately (a^3) = (G M_star) (P^2)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3).

Given that Planet_1's period is 1/3 of Planet_2's. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

So let's let P2 = P, then P1 = P/3.

So a1 = [ (M1) * (P1)^2 ]^(1/3 )

M1 is twice M2, but let's think in terms of M2. Let me say M1 = 2M, M2 = M.

So a1 = (2M * (P/3)^2 )^(1/3) = [ (2 M P²) / 9 ]^(1/3 )

a2 is [ M * (P)^2 ]^(1/3 ) = [ M P² ]^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is.

Now, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / a), assuming R_p (planet radius) is the same for both. But wait, do we know that? The question says both have Earth-like masses. But Earth-like mass doesn't necessarily mean same radius. For example, a more massive planet could be a super-Earth, which is larger in radius. But wait, the question says they have the same mass. Oh, wait, the problem states that both have the same masses. So R_p1 = R_p2, assuming same mass and similar composition. So same radius.

Wait, but let me think: same mass, but if their stars have same radius, but different masses. Well, the planet's radius would depend on its composition. But for the same mass, a denser planet (like a rocky Earth) would have a smaller radius than a gaseous planet of the same mass. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume they have the same radius. Or maybe the question is only considering the star's size for the transit probability.

Wait, but the key is that the transit probability is higher when the planet is closer to the star (smaller a) and when the star is smaller (since R_p is fixed, a smaller star would have a higher R_p/R* ratio). But in this case, both stars have the same radius, so R_p/R* is the same for both planets. Wait no, no, R_p is planet radius, R* is star radius. So if the star's radius is same, and the planet's radius is same, then R_p/R* is same for both. So that part is the same.

Wait, no. Wait, if the planets have same mass but different sizes around same-sized stars? No, the question says they have same masses, but unless they're made of different materials, their radii would be similar. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that R_p is the
