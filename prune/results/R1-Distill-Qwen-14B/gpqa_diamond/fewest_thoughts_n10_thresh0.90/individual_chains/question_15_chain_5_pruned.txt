Okay, so I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit so the researchers should pick that one. Both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host star properties. Hmm, let's think about how transits work.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The formula I remember is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(1 - e²))^½, but wait, since both have circular orbits, the eccentricity term isn't a factor here. So it simplifies.

Wait, but wait. The probability isn't just that. Oh right, the transit probability also depends on the orbital distance. The formula for the probability is (R_p / R_s)² * (a / R_s) * (something about the star's size and the planet's orbital distance). No, wait, I think it's more accurate to say the probability is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/(a * (1 - e²)^0.5)), but wait, that's for the duration. No. Let me get this right.

The transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to align edge-on from our perspective. The probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but I'm not sure. Or wait, the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * sin i)), but since sin i is the inclination, which averages to 1 for random orientations, maybe it's just (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned. Wait, no, the probability of the planet transiting is actually (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)) * (something else?), but perhaps I should think in terms of the parameters given.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability P is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (sqrt(a² - R_s²)) ) ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Specifically, the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), because a is the orbital radius. So that's (R_p^2) / (R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s * a).

Wait, but actually, the formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * (1 - (R_s / a)^2)^0.5 )). Oh, wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

I think the transit probability is primarily determined by two factors: the size of the planet relative to the star, which is (R_p / R_s)^2, and the relative size of the star's orbit in the sky. Wait, perhaps it's more about the orbital plane alignment. The probability that an edge-on orbit exists is higher when the planet is closer because the star is smaller in the sky, so the planet has a higher
