Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, the question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. I need to figure this out step by step.

Let me start by recalling what I know about planetary density. Density is mass divided by volume. So, higher mass and smaller volume would lead to higher density. But the exact composition probably matters too, right?

Looking at the options:

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this would have that density.

Option b) has 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the question says "the following exoplanets", and each describes certain properties. So this planet's density is given as 5.5. So maybe it's similar to Earth, but more massive? But wait, if the density is same as Earth, then when mass increases, the volume would increase with the cube of radius. Let me think. If a planet has double Earth’s mass but same density, its radius would be cube root of (2) times Earth's radius. Because volume scales with radius cubed, and mass scales with volume times density. So if density is same, mass is proportional to volume, which is radius cubed. So if mass is 2x, radius is cube root of 2 ≈1.26 times. So for option b, the density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So its density is same as a).

Option c) same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density as Earth, right? Because composition determines density. So if it's 5x Earth's mass, since density is same, the radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. But the question is about density. Since density is same as Earth, which is 5.5, same as a and b.

Option d) same composition as Earth but half the mass. Then same density, but smaller radius. So density is same as others, 5.5. So what's the deal? Wait, the options a, b, c, d all have varying properties, but some have given densities. Wait, looking back:

Wait, option b says a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. So the density
