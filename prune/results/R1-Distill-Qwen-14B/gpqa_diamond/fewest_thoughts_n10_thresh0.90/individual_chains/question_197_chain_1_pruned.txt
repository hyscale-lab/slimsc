Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduction is used to reduce ketones to alkanes. So, if Compound X has a ketone group, after the reaction, the carbonyl group (C=O) would be reduced to a CH2 group. Or wait, no, wait. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes by turning the carbonyl into a methylene group. So if X is a ketone, the product would have an alkane where the ketone was.

Now, looking at the data for Compound X. The IR and NMR data are given. Let's analyze them.

Starting with the IR data:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad range suggests an -OH stretch. Maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol? But wait, in IR, the broad peak between 3400 and 2500 is often due to OH groups. But wait, let me think. A strong, broad peak around 3000–2500 could be an -OH stretch, but sometimes it's the C-H stretch for alcohols. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very broad, around 2500–3300 cm-1. Also, if there's a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid, that would show up around 1700 cm-1.

Looking at the IR peaks:
- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong peak, which typically indicates a carbonyl group. For a ketone, it's around 1700-1750. If it were a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak is usually lower, around 1700, but sometimes higher. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H peak, which seems present here. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone.

Wait, another peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1. These are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

So putting it together, the IR suggests an aromatic ring (from the peaks around 1600), a carbonyl group (1720), and an O-H group (3400–2500). So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative, like a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group, such as a ketone or an acid.

Now let's look at the NMR data of Compound X.

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm suggests an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols usually have protons around 1-5 ppm, and a broad peak here would be more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets indicate coupling between adjacent aromatic protons. So perhaps a para-disubstituted benzene, like p-methyl, or maybe with another substituent.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet. Could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, maybe near an oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps a methine group (like CH) next to a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons. A doublet here suggests two equivalent neighboring groups. Maybe a CH(CH3) group, perhaps part of a CH2CH(CH3) structure.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a CH2CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl or isopropyl group. Wait, but 3H as triplet, maybe it's attached to a CH2. So like a CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but a triplet at 0.9 would be for the terminal methyl in an ethyl group, like -CH2CH2CH3. So, perhaps a butyl group? Or maybe a propyl.

Putting this together, the NMR suggests:

A benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (since IR has 1720 cm-1), and another substituent is an alkyl chain.

Wait, but wait, let me think: if the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid proton, that would imply that the carbonyl is a COOH group. Because, in that case, the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1 for the carboxylic acid (but wait, I thought carboxylic acids have lower carbonyl peaks, like around 1700 cm-1. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or ketone. Wait, but the O-H in the IR is broad, which fits a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a substituted benzoic acid.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an -OH group elsewhere, but that doesn't fit as well with the NMR.

Wait, let's think again. If the IR shows 1720 cm-1, that's high for a carboxylic acid, as they are typically a bit lower. But maybe it's a ketone. But then why the broad peak in IR between 3400 and 2500?

Maybe the 1720 is a ketone, and the broad peak is an alcohol. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm proton is a broad singlet, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols typically don't show up that high unless they're acidic, like phenols.

Wait, phenol O-H protons are around 5-7 ppm, but that's a broad peak. But the NMR shows 10.5 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid with another substituent.

So, if the benzene ring is para-substituted, with a COOH group and another substituent.

Looking at the substituents:

The substituent's NMR:

At 2.9 ppm, a multiplet for 1H. Perhaps a CH group connected to the ring.

At 1.7 ppm, m, 2H: perhaps a CH2 group.

At 1.4 ppm, d, 3H: maybe a CH(CH3) group.

At 0.9 ppm, t, 3H: a CH2CH2CH3 group, so perhaps the substituent is a chain that's ethyl or similar.

Putting this together, the substituent on the benzene (other than COOH) might be a propyl or butyl group.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a COOH group in position 4, and a substituent in position 1 (or another para position). Let's say the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the NMR.

Looking at the substituent's protons:

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. Maybe a CH connected to a carbonyl. Because in a ketone, the adjacent CH would be around 2.5-3 ppm.

Wait, but if it's a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH connected to an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2COOH? No, that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. For example, a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the NMR shows:

At 1.4 ppm, d (doublet) for 3H. That's a methyl group attached to a CH2, perhaps.

And 0.9 ppm, t, 3H. That's a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain, but let's count the NMR signals.

So, the substituent's signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) : maybe a CH next to the ring.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps two CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm
