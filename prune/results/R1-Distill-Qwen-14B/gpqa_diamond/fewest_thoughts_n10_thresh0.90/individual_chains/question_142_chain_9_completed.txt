Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix is positioned in the qubit space. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about density matrices and qubit states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, wait, I think I remember that a density matrix usually represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

So, what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit? A general density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and r is a vector that determines the state's position on the Bloch sphere. The vector r has components (x, y, z), and its magnitude determines whether it's a pure or mixed state. If |r| = 1, it's a pure state; otherwise, it's a mixed state.

Looking at the given ρ, let's expand it. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. Let me compute this. |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 at (2,2) and zeros elsewhere. Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives ρ = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is the identity matrix multiplied by 0.5, because the identity matrix I for 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]], so ½ I is exactly this ρ.

Wait, so ρ = (I)/2. Now, let me compare this with the general form I mentioned earlier: (I + r·σ)/2. If I set r·σ to zero, then (I + 0)/2 is ½ I, which matches ρ. So r must be the zero vector here.

So the components of r are all zero: x=0, y=0, z=0. That would be the point (0,0,0). But wait, in the Bloch sphere representation, the origin (0,0,0) is the completely mixed state, right? Because when r is zero, the state is ½ I, which is the maximally mixed state, meaning equal probability of 0 and 1, with no coherence.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which matches this. So the geometrical position of this density matrix is at the origin in the Bloch sphere representation.

Alternatively, thinking about eigenvalues: the given ρ has both eigenvalues as 0.5. The eigenvalues of a density matrix must be between 0 and 1, which they are here. The trace is 1, so it's a valid density matrix. Since the state is a completely mixed state, it's in the center of the Bloch sphere, which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a single qubit, the general form of a density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is a vector determining the state's position, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

In the Bloch sphere representation, the origin \((0, 0, 0)\) corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is consistent with \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\). This state has no coherence and equal probability of being in either the \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
