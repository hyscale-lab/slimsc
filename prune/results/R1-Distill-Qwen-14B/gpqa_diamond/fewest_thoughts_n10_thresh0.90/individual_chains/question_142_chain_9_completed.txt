Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, what's the question again?

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space from the given options.

Wait, I think the qubit space is represented in a Bloch sphere. Right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But what's the representation for a density matrix?

Oh right, any density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. So I can compare this with the given ρ.

Let me write down the given ρ:

ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|)

Wait, |0><0| is the outer product, so it's a projector. Similarly for |1><1|. So adding them and dividing by 2: that's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

What's the standard form for ρ? The general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Let me write I as the identity matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So ρ can be rewritten. Let's compute each term. Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1|.

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ becomes (I)/2. Because (I)/2 is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

Wait, so the given ρ is (I)/2. So comparing to the general form (I + r·σ)/2. So (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

So r·σ = 0. The only way this happens is if r is zero. Because if the vector r is (rx, ry, rz), then r·σ is rx σ_x + ry σ_y + rz σ_z. The only time this equals zero matrix is when rx=ry=rz=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would place the state at the origin, which is the completely mixed state. Because a pure state is on the surface of the Bloch sphere (like r of length 1), whereas a mixed state is inside. The completely mixed state is at the center.

Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → Not zero, so it's a pure state? Wait, no. The length of the vector would be sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +0^2) = sqrt(2). But the Bloch vector for a single qubit pure state has length 1. So this can't be a pure state, so it's a mixed state with r of length sqrt(2), but the given ρ is (I/2), which is the completely mixed state.

Wait, let me think again. The density matrix ρ given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's equivalent to I/2. So in terms of Bloch vector, that's the center, r=0. So the correct option is C) r=(0,0,0).

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: The density matrix in vector form can be written as a vector in the Bloch sphere. The standard form for a density matrix is (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2, where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

So, for the given ρ, when we express it as (I + r·σ)/2, then r must be (0,0,0), because ρ is I/2.

Alternatively, the density matrix ρ is diagonal with entries (1/2, 1/2). The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is [[ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ]]. So comparing this to ρ, which is [[ 1/2 , 0 ], [0, 1/2 ]].

So, in this case, (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 - r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

And the off-diagonal terms are (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 and (r_x + i r_y)/2 =0 → which implies that r_x=0 and r_y=0.

So all components rx, ry, rz are zero. So r is (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. Comparing this to the general form of a single-qubit density matrix:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, it is clear that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). The only way this is possible is if \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This represents a mixed state, but not the completely mixed state at the origin. Incorrect.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** This represents a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the mixed state. Incorrect.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** This represents the completely mixed state at the origin, which matches the given density matrix. Correct.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** This represents a mixed state, but not the completely mixed state at the origin. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
