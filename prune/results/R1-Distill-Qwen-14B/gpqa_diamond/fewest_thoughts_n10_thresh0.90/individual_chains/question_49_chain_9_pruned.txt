Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are a type of pericyclic reaction. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the movement of a sigma bond with the shift of pi bonds. The classic examples mentioned are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which are both [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

The problem has three parts, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the given starting materials and conditions. The options are given as A, B, C and I have to choose the correct set.

Let's take each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol with H+ and Heat. So, the starting materials are an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon and an allylic alcohol (but-3-en-2-ol). The conditions are acidic and heat, which usually suggests some kind of rearrangement or condensation reaction.

Wait, but the H+ and heat might promote the formation of a carbocation or perhaps a conjugate acid. Alternatively, maybe a hemiacetal or some kind of ring formation. Alternatively, considering sigmatropic rearrangements, perhaps a Cope or Claisen-like mechanism isn't the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution or an elimination.

Wait, but the product is A, and looking at the options, some of them are amines with cyclic structures. For example, option A and D have 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine. That structure has a six-membered ring with two methoxy groups and an amine. So pyran is a six-membered oxygen ring, like a cyclic ether with two oxygen substituents? Wait, pyran is an oxygen-containing six-membered ring with one oxygen, like furan but with five members. Wait, no, pyran is similar to pyrone but six-membered. So the product A in options A and D is a dihydropyran amine.

How would that form? Let's think about the starting materials. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CHNH2. When heated under acidic conditions, perhaps the amine could act as a nucleophile. But but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol, which in acidic conditions might form an oxonium ion or something else.

Wait, but another possibility is that the 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine could undergo some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the two molecules are reacting via some kind of condensation.

Wait, another approach: the starting material has two methoxy groups on an amine. Maybe under acidic conditions, one of the methoxy groups leaves as a leaving group, forming a carbocation adjacent to the amine. But then, with the allylic alcohol, perhaps a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclization could happen.

Alternatively,
