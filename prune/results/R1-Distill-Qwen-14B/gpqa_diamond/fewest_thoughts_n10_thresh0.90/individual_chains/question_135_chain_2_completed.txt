Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of this boson X. The problem gives me the interaction Lagrangian and the mass of X is 6 GeV. Hmm, I remember that for a particle to decay into another pair of particles, the sum of the masses of those particles has to be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So I need to look at the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f̄ (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that's a Yukawa coupling kind of term. The term ψ_f̄ X ψ_f suggests that the boson X interacts with fermions of type f. So the fermions that X can couple to are the ones in this term.

But wait, the fermion here is denoted as f, and in the term, it's ψ_f. So X can interact with any fermion that's present in the theory. But wait, the problem is asking about possible decay channels, so X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass allows it.

But wait, the problem is about the interaction given. The Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f ψ_f̄ X ψ_f. So I think that this implies that the boson X couples to each fermion species f. So the possible decay products are any fermion-antifermion pairs that the X can produce, subject to mass constraints.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the sum of the masses of the fermions in the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, fermions have their own masses. So I need to list all possible fermion pairs where each fermion's mass is ≤ 3 GeV (since each would get half the mass, but wait, actually it depends on whether the fermions are at rest or not. Oh, wait, in particle physics, when a particle decays, the rest masses of the decay products must satisfy that 2m ≤ M, where M is the mass of the decaying particle. So for each fermion species, 2m_f ≤ M_X.

So let me list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV (but for simplicity, let's say ~5 MeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are negligible, but they aren't considered here because the Lagrangian doesn't have them.

So for X (6 GeV) decaying into a pair, the sum of the two masses must be ≤6 GeV. Let's check each fermion:

1. b quark: about 4.5 GeV per quark. So 2m_b ≈9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So b quarks can't be produced as a pair because 4.5*2=9>6. Wait, but wait, because the quarks are produced as a pair, each has mass m. So 2m ≤6 GeV. So m ≤3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass ≤ 3 GeV can be part of the decay. Let's see:

- u: 2 MeV, so 2m_u=4 MeV <<6 GeV. So possible. So uū is allowed.
- d: ~5 MeV, 2m_d=10 MeV, allowed. So d d̄ allowed.
- s: ~100 MeV, 2m_s=200 MeV, allowed. So s s̄ allowed.
- c: ~1.5 GeV. 2m_c=3 GeV, which is exactly 3 GeV. So allowed. So c c̄ allowed.
- b: ~4.5 GeV, 2m_b=9 GeV>6 GeV. Not allowed.
- t: 173 GeV, way too big. Not allowed.
- e: negligible, allowed.
- μ: ~105.7 MeV. 2m_μ=211.4 MeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So μ+μ− allowed.
- τ: ~1.78 GeV. 2m_τ≈3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So τ+τ− allowed.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the Lagrangian in the problem is written as L = -λ f ψ_f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f (y). So the interaction term is like X coupling to each fermion ψ_f. So X can couple to any of the fermions in the theory. So the possible decay products are any fermion pair (ff̄) where the sum of their masses is ≤6 GeV.

So possible fermions are: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. Because their masses are low enough.

Wait, but wait about the quarks. When a boson decays into quarks, in reality, the quarks must form hadrons. But in this question, perhaps we're just considering the possible decay products regardless of the strong force confinement. Because the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So it's purely based on mass and possible coupling.

Wait, but the options include quark pairs like b b̄, but wait, as we said earlier, the mass of b is about 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So any option that includes b b̄ as a decay channel is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+τ-, e+ e−. But since b is too heavy, option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+ e−. So this includes c which is allowed (mass ~1.5 GeV, so 2m=3 GeV ≤6 GeV). So this is possible.

Option C: X→c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+τ−, etc. But t is way too heavy, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b b̄, so D is incorrect.

So the correct options are B, because it includes c, which is allowed, but not b or t.

Wait, but what about the fermion masses again. Let me double-check:

c quark: around 1.27 GeV (PDG average is about 1.27±0.02 GeV). So 2m_c=2.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c c̄ is allowed.

What about the tau? 2m_τ = 2*(1.78) = ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So τ+τ- is allowed.

Similarly, muon: 2m_μ = 0.211 GeV (211 MeV), allowed.

So all these are allowed.

So the possible decay channels are to any fermion pair where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

The fermions that fit this are:

e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

So the decay products would include ee, μμ, ττ, uu, dd, ss, cc.

Looking back at the options:

Option B lists c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+ e−. That's all the possible allowed fermions except, wait, does it include the bottom or top? No, so option B seems correct.

Wait, but what about the fact that in the interaction Lagrangian, X couples to each fermion f, so all the fermions are possible decay products as long as their mass allows.

So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option B includes c c̄, which is allowed, and the others. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian and the mass constraints for fermion pairs. The Lagrangian describes the interaction of \( X \) with fermions \( \psi_f \), allowing \( X \) to decay into any fermion-antifermion pair \( f\bar{f} \) as long as the total mass of the decay products satisfies \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

9. **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.
