Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle physics, specifically dealing with the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure how that directly affects the decay possibilities, so maybe I can focus more on the mass and the particles involved.

Wait, the Lagrangian is something like L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this looks like an interaction term between the boson X and some fermions. The fermions here are ψ_f, and f probably stands for the flavor or type of fermion. The presence of X in the term suggests that X is a boson that can couple to these fermions.

But the main thing here is the mass of X, which is 6 GeV. When a particle decays, the decay products' combined mass must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So, for each possible decay channel, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but fermions come in pairs because bosons like X can decay into two particles. So each decay would be X → f f-bar, where f is a fermion.

So I need to list all the possible fermions f such that 2 * m_f < 6 GeV. Because X is bosonic and decays into two fermions, each with mass m_f, so 2m_f must be less than M_X =6 GeV.

Wait, but wait, are all the fermions considered here? Like, which fermions are allowed in the Standard Model?

Let me think about the masses of all the known fermions:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (but in reality, it's about 2.2 MeV, so 0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~0.0047 GeV (about 4.7 MeV)
- Strange (s): ~0.100 GeV (100 MeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

So for each fermion f, 2m_f must be less than 6 GeV.

Let me compute 2m_f for each:

- e: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV → allowed
- μ: 0.21 GeV → allowed
- τ: 3.554 GeV → 3.554 <6 → allowed
- u: 0.004 GeV → allowed
- d: 0.0094 GeV → allowed
- s: 0.2 GeV → allowed
- c: 3 GeV → 3 <6 → allowed
- b: 9 GeV → 9>6 → not allowed
- t: 346 GeV → way over, so no.

Wait, but the b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So 2 *4.5 =9 GeV. So X (6 GeV) can't decay into a b quark-antiquark pair. So the possible fermions are all except b and t.

So any fermion pair where 2m_f <6 GeV is allowed. So for the options, which ones include only fermions with m_f <3 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b's mass is 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e. Let's see masses:

c: 1.5 GeV → 3 GeV <6 → allowed.
s: 0.1 GeV → 0.2 <6 → allowed.
u, d: negligible, allowed.
tau: ~1.777 GeV → 3.554 <6 → allowed.
mu: 0.105 → 0.21 <6 → allowed.
e: allowed.

So B includes c, but not b. So possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e.

Wait, t is top quark, which is way too heavy. 2m_t is way over 6. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, b is 4.5, 2m =9>6 → D is not allowed.

So the correct option should be B, which includes all fermions except b and t, but includes c, which is allowed.

Wait, but the given Lagrangian: the interaction term is for ψ_f, which must be the same type of fermion. So X can decay into any pair of fermions where the fermion type is allowed.

Thus, the allowed fermions are those with m_f <3 GeV.

So the possible decay products are:

e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Wait, but in the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So the correct answer must be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a particle to decay into two fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the combined rest mass of the fermions must satisfy \( 2m_f < M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). 

The masses of the known fermions in the Standard Model are approximately:

- \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_s \approx 0.100 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \).

For each fermion, \( 2m_f \) must be less than 6 GeV. This allows the following fermions as decay products:

- \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2m_u = 0.004 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2m_d = 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2m_s = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Decays into \( b \bar{b} \) (\( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)) and \( t \bar{t} \) (\( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)) are not allowed. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, which lists all kinematically allowed decay modes of the boson \( X \).

Answer: B
