Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything perfectly. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) cleavage reaction, usually for the cleavage of double bonds. So, the reaction is probably a dihalide addition or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction? Or maybe it's for the cleavage of alkenes. Let me think. Oh, right! When an alkene reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a hydrohalogenation reaction, specifically an addition reaction where the HI adds across the double bond. But wait, wait, another possibility: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination? No, no, maybe that's with other reagents. Hmm. Or, another thought: perhaps it's a cleavage of a triple bond? No, I don't think so. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used for the cleavage of alkynes. Oh wait, no, that's with different conditions. Alternatively, I might be confusing things. Let me think again.

Wait, when you have an alkene and treat it with HI (hydroiodic acid), especially in the presence of a red phosphorus catalyst, it's a halogenation or addition. Oh, right! That's the addition of HI to alkenes. So the double bond would open up, and each carbon would get an iodine. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, when HI adds to an alkene, especially in a non-polar solvent and with a catalyst, it's a Markownikoff addition. So the HI adds across the double bond, putting the H on the less substituted carbon and the I on the more substituted one, because HI is a strong acid and the reaction follows the more stable carbocation.

But wait, the question is about the product after this reaction. So we need to figure out what Compound X is, and then what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

So the first step is to determine the structure of Compound X based on the IR and NMR data provided.

Let's look at the IR data:

IR peaks: 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, which usually suggests O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Wait, because carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches around 2500–3300 cm-1, often as a broad peak. But another possibility for that region is an alkyne C-H stretch or maybe an amine N-H, but I think the broadness here is more indicative of O-H. Then, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or carboxylic acid. But wait, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1. 1720 is a bit higher, maybe indicating an ester or ketone. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, sometimes the carbonyl can be a bit higher, depending on the substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Another peak at 1610 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. And 1450 cm-1 is probably another aromatic ring vibration.

So from the IR, I'm thinking aromatic ring (peaks at 1610 and 1450), a carbonyl (1720 cm-1), and maybe an O-H group (3400–2500 and 1720 could imply a carboxylic acid, but the presence of a carbonyl and O-H would fit that).

Now the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an O-H proton in a carboxylic acid. So that would support the presence of a carboxylic acid group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. That suggests two aromatic protons in a para-substituted pattern. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Like a para-substituted benzene.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. So perhaps two protons adjacent on the benzene ring. Wait, but if it's para-substituted, like in a para-dichlorobenzene, but here we have two doublets—might it be a disubstituted benzene where the substituents are in the para positions, and the two protons are each as a pair in a doublet? Like maybe a meta or para substitution, but wait, wait. Let me think. If the ring has two substituents in para positions, then the two protons on each side would be equivalent. So for example, if there's a substituent at position 4, then the H's in positions 3 and 5 would each be a pair. Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 4 and 1, but that might complicate. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent with two substituents in such a way that each substituent has two H's as doublets. Hmm, perhaps it's a substituent that's causing the ring's H's to split into two doublets, like in a para-substituted benzene with another substituent.

Wait, but let's consider that the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are each a doublet of 2H. That could suggest a para-disubstituted benzene, where each substituent's effect splits the adjacent Hs into doublets. For example, if there's a substituent at the para position, and another substituent elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that each substituent is in the para and another position. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with another group that's causing the ring's H's to split.

Wait, maybe the benzene ring has two substituents, one in the para position and another in the ortho position? No, that might complicate the splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single substituent that's causing the ring's H's to split into two sets of doublets. For example, a substituent in the para position, and another group in the meta position. Hmm, not sure yet. Let's proceed.

Next peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for 1H. That could be a methine (CH) group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe near a carbonyl or part of a substituent on the benzene.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet for 2H. Perhaps part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl or another substituent.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet. A CH3 group attached to a CH2 or another CH group, perhaps as in an isopropyl or similar substituent.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H. This is likely a terminal CH3 group, like in an ethyl chain. So perhaps part of a longer chain attached to the benzene ring.

Putting this together, maybe the benzene ring has substituents that include a carboxylic acid group and another substituent with an ethyl chain and possibly a branching.

Wait, looking back at the IR: 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl, maybe from a ketone or an ester, but given the O-H in the NMR, perhaps a carboxylic acid. So 1720 might be a bit high for a carboxylic acid, but sometimes conjugation can shift it higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H peak would be broad and around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm in the NMR.

Wait, the NMR shows a 1H at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet. That's very characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. So that makes me think that the compound has a carboxylic acid group. So the carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 would be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. But wait, typically, carboxylic acids have lower wavenumbers, around 1700 cm-1, maybe 1710. Hmm, so 1720 is a bit higher. Could it be an ester? Because esters have carbonyls around 1730-1750 cm-1. Oh, but then where's the O-H? Because in that case, the IR would not show O-H. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. Wait, but then the NMR wouldn't have a broad peak at 10.5, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid. So maybe the carbonyl is from the acid, and the IR peak is a bit higher than usual. Or perhaps the compound is a benzoyl chloride or something else, but then the NMR wouldn't have the broad O-H.

Wait, let me think again. The NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak with 1H as a singlet. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. So the compound must have a COOH group. Therefore, the IR 1720 cm-1 is likely the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid.

So, putting it together: the compound has a benzene ring with substituents, a carboxylic acid group, and a substituent that has a chain leading to an ethyl group (as indicated by the 0.9 ppm triplet). Let's see.

In the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggest a CH(CH2CH3) group or something similar. Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, so maybe a methyl group attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is that CH group. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH group, perhaps.

So this structure could be a benzyl group with a substituent that is a -CH(CH2CH3) group, perhaps.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene might be a carboxylic acid and a side chain. For example, perhaps the benzene has a COOH group in the para position and another substituent which is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Or maybe it's a propyl group attached via a CH.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group. Wait, wait. Let me see:

The substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. Let me try to draw it.

So, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a -COOH group, and the other is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably the CH group in a substituent, perhaps connected to a CH2 and a CH3. Let me think: maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Or perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Because isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, but that might not fit the NMR data exactly.

Wait, let me think: the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to another group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a terminal CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain, but with branching.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, no. Wait, sec-butyl would be CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait: no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3), but that's not quite right. Wait, no, wait: the structure of iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-, but wait no, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CH-. No, wait, that's iso-propyl. Let me think again.

Wait, but the substituent could be a propyl group with a
