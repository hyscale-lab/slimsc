Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product. The options are A to D, and each is a different organic compound.

First, let's look at the spectroscopic data provided: IR and 1H NMR.

Starting with the IR data: There are strong peaks in the 3400–2500 cm-1 region. That's a broad area, often indicative of O-H stretching, maybe from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, looking at the 1720 cm-1 peak: that's a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Hmm, but wait the 1720 is in the range for a carboxylic acid (which is usually around 1700-1725 cm-1). But wait, I also remember that if it's an ester, the carbonyl is similar, maybe a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone? Wait, no, ketones are usually around 1680–1780. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, broad. But in the IR, the first region is 3400–2500, which is a broad area, so maybe an O-H. Oh, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, around 2500-3300, and maybe the 3400? Wait, but the first peak is 3400–2500, so that includes both O-H and maybe some other stretches like N-H or alcohols.

Wait, but in the NMR, let's check. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a very high chemical shift, which usually indicates an aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm) or a carboxylic acid proton (which is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak). Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but the O-H would be a broad peak around 2500-3300. So in the IR, the 3400–2500 region probably includes the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, and the 1720 is the carbonyl. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching.

So putting that together, maybe Compound X has a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring. Let me think about the NMR data.

The NMR has several signals:

- 10.5 ppm: that's a singlet but broad (bs, 1H). So that's likely a carboxylic acid proton. Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but they're split if next to something, but in this case, it's a broad singlet, so maybe a carboxylic acid.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): that suggests two aromatic protons as a doublet. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) would be another set of two aromatic protons as a doublet. So that's a para-substituted aromatic ring, perhaps. So the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but how? Let me think. If it's two substituents, maybe one is a carboxylic acid group and the other is an alkyl group? Or maybe one substituent is in the para position, but in this case, the splitting suggests a para substitution. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the coupling between the protons would lead to a doublet.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituents are in the meta positions, but I think that would lead to more splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-disubstituted benzene, with substituents at positions 1 and 4, but wait, no, para is 1 and 3? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, in a benzene ring, para is 1,4 positions. So if the ring has two substituents, each with two protons, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm are both doublets with 2H each. So that suggests that each pair of protons is equivalent and coupled to each other.

Ah! So imagine a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, no, because in that case, each substituent would have protons that are para to each other. Alternatively, perhaps it's a monosubstituted benzene with a substituent that causes the protons to split into two doublets. Wait, for example, if the substituent is at position 1, then the neighboring protons (positions 2 and 6) would be a pair, and positions 3 and 5 another pair, but that would lead to more complex splitting, perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted group. Let me think: if the substituent is at position 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be a doublet each, but wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 1, and the ring has another substituent, but wait, that might not be possible.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group that causes the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the ring has a substituent at position 4, then the ring's protons would be in ortho and para positions relative to that group. But I'm getting confused. Let me try drawing it.

Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent at position 4 (like a carboxylic acid group). Then, the ring would have two protons adjacent (ortho) to the substituent and two more across (para). Wait, but the substituent is at position 4, so the adjacent would be positions 3 and 5, but then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to that? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at position 1, making the ring have a substituent there, and then the other substituents are elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the substituent is at position 4, and the ring has another substituent elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has two substituents. Let me think. The NMR shows two sets of doublets with 2H each. That suggests that the aromatic ring has two pairs of equivalent protons, each pair being adjacent or across from substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent in the para position. No, that would make it a di-substituted benzene with substituents in position 1 and 4? Wait, maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two substituents in the para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the ring has a substituent at position 1 and another at position 3 (meta), but that would lead to different splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group in the para position relative to a carboxylic acid group. Let's think: in that case, the ring would have the substituents at positions 1 (carboxylic acid) and 4 (methyl). Then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So each pair would have the same chemical environment. Then, the protons at 2 and 6 would be para to the methyl group, perhaps. Let me think about their shifts.

Wait, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H) could correspond to two sets of protons. The higher shift (8.0) suggests they are more deshielded. If the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carboxylic acid, the adjacent protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. So the 8.0 ppm could be the protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group, and 7.2 could be the para protons relative to the methyl group. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the aromatic ring has a substituent at position 4, which is a methyl group, and the substituent at position 1 is a carboxylic acid. Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the carboxylic acid, and their chemical shift would be around 8.0 ppm as a doublet. The protons at positions 3 and 5 would be ortho to the methyl group and perhaps para to the carboxylic acid, leading to a lower shift, around 7.2 ppm, as another doublet.

Wait, but then the substituents would be in the 1 and 4 positions. So the NMR would show two doublets: the ortho protons to the acid (8.0 ppm) and the ortho protons to the methyl (7.2 ppm).

But then, looking at the other NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a multiplet, which suggests a CH group attached to something else. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is another multiplet, maybe a CH2 attached to something. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of three protons, perhaps a methyl group attached to an oxygen or a CH2. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, likely a terminal CH2CH2CH3 or similar.

So putting this together, perhaps there's a side chain attached to the aromatic ring. For example, a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar.

Wait, let me think about possible structures based on the NMR. The 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid (maybe an -COOH group), the aromatic protons suggest substituents in the para positions, perhaps a methyl group and a carboxylic acid group attached to the ring.

Then, the other signals at lower ppm suggest a substituent on the ring that's an alkyl chain. For example, maybe a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or similar.

Wait, looking at the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H): that might be a CH group attached to two other groups, perhaps as in a CH that's part of a larger substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to a branch. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2 group perhaps, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3 group.

Hmm, so maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, let me think. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the central CH in an isobutyl group. So, for example, a structure like benzene with a substituent that's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl chain. The 2.9 ppm is a CH, then two CH2 groups. Wait, but the 1.7 ppm is 2H as a multiplet. So maybe it's a CH2 connected to a CH which is connected to another CH2 group and a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to the ring. Let me think: isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the NMR would have signals for the CH2 next to the ring (maybe around 2.9 ppm), and then the CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet) for 3H. That's a methyl group attached to something. So perhaps a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, let me try to draw the structure.

The aromatic ring has a substituent at position 1 (let's say) which is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and another substituent at position 4 which is an isobutyl group. Wait, or perhaps position 4 is a methyl group, but that doesn't fit with the other signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's think about the substituent as being a propyl chain with a methyl branch.

Wait, another approach: the NMR signals.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal methyl group in a propyl chain, perhaps. The 1.4 ppm d (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, maybe as in a branching point. Then, the 1.7 ppm m (2H) is a CH2 group adjacent to a branch, and the 2.9 ppm m (1H) is a CH group attached to two other groups.

So putting this together, the substituent is likely a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, because CH2CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH2 connected to a CH that's connected to a CH2CH3. But then, the 1.4 ppm would be the CH(CH2CH3) group. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch. Let's think: the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the structure would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2. But wait, CH(CH3)2 would be a geminal dimethyl, which might not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-. Hmm, perhaps it's -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me think about the NMR. The 2.9 ppm is a CH that's connected to a CH2 and another group. The 1.7 ppm is a CH2 next to the CH, and the 1.4 ppm is a CH3 group attached to that CH.

Wait, so the substituent could be a isopropyl group attached via a CH2. So maybe it's -CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then, the 1.7 ppm would be a CH2 connected to the CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, but that makes the structure something like benzene with a substituent -CH2
