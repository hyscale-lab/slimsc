Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two given reactions. Hmm, let's break it down.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide can form cyanohydrins. Oh right, that's the cyanohydrin reaction. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. But how does that happen? I think the mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon. Then, the oxygen becomes an alcohol, which would pick up a proton. So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and reagent A. What's A? The reaction conditions depend on whether it's acid or base catalyzed. In the cyanohydrin formation, I think it's usually done under acidic conditions. Because the cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile, but in basic conditions, it might deprotonate something else, like the alcohol. Oh wait, the product has an -OH group, so if we had a base, maybe the OH would get deprotonated, forming an O- which could then react further, but in this case, the product has the OH as is. So perhaps the reaction is acid-catalyzed. Or maybe the cyanide is added in a way that it's not in a strong base. Hmm.

Wait, but I remember that the cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. Like, H+ is present to help the attack. So the reagent A is probably H3O+ or something acidic. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the options, A and B have H3O+ as option A, while C and D have NaHSO3. Hmm, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- but maybe in a different context. Wait, but for the cyanohydrin, I think H+ is needed as a catalyst. So reagent A is H3O+.

Wait, but some sources say that the cyanohydrin formation can also be done with a weak acid, but H3O+ is a strong acid. Could it be that the reaction doesn't require strong acid? Alternatively, maybe in this case, the reagent is something else.

Wait, but looking at the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the product is a cyanohydrin, so the reagent A must be the acid that helps form the cyanohydrin. So I think A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hmm, wait, that's a nitrile converting to a carboxylic acid. Oh, that's the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.

Wait, how does that happen? I think the general reaction is nitrile → amide → carboxylic acid. But the specifics matter. So the nitrile is in a molecule that's attached to a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So when it's hydrolyzed, it would form a carboxylic acid.

What are the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis? I think that under acidic conditions, especially with aqueous H2SO4 and heat, nitriles can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under basic conditions, they might form carboxylates, which can be acidified to get the carboxylic acid.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the reaction must be under acidic or basic conditions followed by acid workup. But the question says that reagent B is H2O. Hmm, that's not adding up. Wait, maybe reagent B is the catalyst. Or perhaps the reaction involves another reagent.

Wait, the second reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile (with a benzyl group) reacting with B (H2O) to form the butanoic acid. So I'm thinking that the nitrile is hydrolyzing to a carboxylic acid. To do this, usually, you need a strong acid or a strong base. For example, in acidic conditions, you might use H2SO4 and heat. Alternatively, in basic conditions, like with NaOH and heat, you get the carboxylate, which is then acidified.

But the question says that reagent B is H2O, which
