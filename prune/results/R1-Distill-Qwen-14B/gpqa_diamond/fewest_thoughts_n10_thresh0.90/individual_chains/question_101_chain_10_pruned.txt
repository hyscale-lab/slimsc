Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see if I can figure it out. Okay, the question says that 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with compound A in the presence of a catalyst B, under heat and a solvent, to give 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to pick the right reagent A and catalyst B from the options.

First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and a nitrogen. The methyl group is on the third carbon. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Hmm, "cyclohexylidene" suggests a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, so maybe a cyclohexenyl group attached as a substituent.

Wait, the product structure: 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl) means the cyclohexylidene group is attached to the first carbon of the pyrrolidine. So, the cyclohexylidene is a substituent on the pyrrolidine ring. That makes me think of some kind of alkylation or addition reaction.

The reaction is acid-catalyzed, so the catalyst is probably an acid. The options for B are TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid, which is a strong acid and catalyst in many reactions) or acetic acid. Both are acidic, but TsOH is a stronger acid.

Compound A is either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. So, what's the possible reaction here? Let's think about the possible mechanisms.

If the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine and it's reacting with A, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation or addition. Another possibility is that it's forming an iminium ion. Oh wait, in acid-catalyzed reactions, especially with amines, they can form iminium ions which can then react with carbonyl compounds.

Wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst and a carbonyl compound, maybe it's an example of the Michael addition or some kind of enamine formation. Alternatively, think about the von Braun degradation, but that's for amides. Alternatively, maybe it's a Beckmann rearrangement, but that involves oximes.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. When secondary amines react with carbonyl compounds under acidic conditions, they can form iminium ions. For example, the formation of enamines. Enamines are typically formed from secondary amines and ketones or aldehydes. The process involves two steps: the amine reacts with the carbonyl to form an iminium intermediate, which then undergoes elimination (usually with another molecule of amine) to form the enamine.

In the product, the substituent is a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine. So, perhaps the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is reacting with the amine. Let me think: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde group attached to a cyclohexane ring. If that reacts with the amine, maybe it forms an imine or an enamine.

Wait, when an amine reacts with an aldehyde under acid catalysis, what's the product? The first step would be the formation of a protonated imine. Then, perhaps dehydration occurs to form an iminium ion, which could lead to a ring expansion or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is acting as a carbonyl electrophile. The secondary amine (3-methylpyrrolidine) would attack the carbonyl, form an iminium intermediate, and then eliminate water to form an imine (Schiff base). But in this case, the product is not a Schiff base.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a conjugate addition. If A is a carbonyl, like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then the iminium ion could undergo a conjugate addition if there's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is just an aldehyde, not conjugated.

Wait, but if A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then perhaps it's involved in a condensation reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Claisen or aldol addition, but that typically involves carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, let's think about the product. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the substituent on the pyrrolidine is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexylidene group. Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be CH2-C6H10-CH2? No, wait, cyclohexylidene is CH2-C6H9 with a double bond. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclohexenyl group attached via a methylene bridge.

Wait, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene ring attached to the pyrrolidine. Like, the pyrrolidine's first carbon has a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexene ring. So, the product is a bicyclic compound?

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening or a ring-forming reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the product has a five-membered ring fused with a six-membered ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition of the amine to a carbonyl, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the possible reactions involving amines and aldehydes.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of acid, amines can undergo alkylation if an alkylating agent is present. But here, the reagent is either an aldehyde or a vinylcyclohexane. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, so maybe it's a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, if A is vinylcyclohexane, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction? But that would require a diene and a dienophile. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a C-alkylation of the amine. But how? Vinylcyclohexane isn't a typical alkylating agent. For that, you usually have an alkyl halide or something with a good leaving group.

Wait, another angle: the product's structure suggests that a cyclohexene ring is attached via a methylene group to the pyrrolidine. So perhaps the starting reagent A is a cyclohexylidene compound, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an example of the Stork enamine synthesis. Enamine synthesis typically involves the reaction of an enamine with a ketone or aldehyde, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. The process involves first forming the enamine from a secondary amine and a ketone, and then adding a carbonyl compound to form the new product.

Wait, the Stork enamine synthesis: you form an enamine from a secondary amine and a ketone. Then, when you add an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, the enamine can perform a conjugate addition. But wait, in this case, the starting amine is 3-methyl
