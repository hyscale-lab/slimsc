Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let's think about what I know.

So, the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Oh wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but same radius. Interesting.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So I need to figure out which planet has a higher transit probability.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by some other factors. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. Oh right, the transit probability is higher if the planet's orbit is edge-on. But without knowing the inclination, how do we compare?

Wait, but for the purpose of this question, maybe we can model it based on the orbital separation and the star's size. Oh, right! There's a formula for the probability of a planet transiting. I think it's something like P ≈ (R_star / a)^2, but I'm not sure. Or wait, the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a transit is given by P = (R_star / a) * (something else). Alternatively, I think the formula is P = (R_star / a) * (something else depending on the orbital parameters). Wait, perhaps it's (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So for circular orbits, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), but wait no, I might be getting that wrong.

Wait, another approach: The transit occurs when the planet passes directly in front of the star from our point of view. The probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. So the formula for the transit probability is P = (R_* / a)², but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's P = (R_* / a) multiplied by some other factor.

Alternatively, the probability is approximately equal to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet. Because only when the planet's orbit is within a certain angle can we see a transit. So for each planet, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So the planet with a smaller a (closer in) would have a higher probability.

Wait, but let's get this right. The formula for the transit probability for a circular orbit is P ≈ (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + m_p / M_* )^(1/3)), but wait, no, that's the probability when considering the Doppler method, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability that the inclination is just right for a transit is given by P ≈ (R*/a) * (something else).

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the factors. Let me look it up in my mind. Oh, right! The transit probability is P = (R*/a) * ( (1 + R_p / R*) ) / ( ... wait, no, perhaps a better formula is P = (R* / a) * (1) / (sqrt(1 - (b_min)^2)) ) ), but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach: the probability that a planet transits is approximately equal to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis distance, assuming that the semi-major axis is large compared to the star's size. So P ≈ (R*/a). But wait, that can't be right when a is in astronomical units. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R*/a)^2. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (2 R* / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/M_*)^(1/3))) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read before that the transit probability is P ≈ (R*/a) * (1) / (sqrt(1 - (b_min)^2)), but I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is the area of the star's disk, as seen from Earth, divided by the area of the annulus where the planet could be on the sky relative to the star. Hmm, but that might be too complex.

Wait, perhaps a more straightforward way. The probability of transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance between the star and the planet's orbital plane. Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the basic factors.

The key factors that affect the transit probability are the star's radius, the planet's orbital distance, and the inclination of the orbit. Since both planets have the same mass and same host star radius, but different orbital periods and different host masses, I need to find out which planet is more likely to have its orbit aligned such that we see a transit.

Wait, but the transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So P = (R*/a) * (some function of the planet's size and other factors). But actually, the exact formula, for a randomly oriented orbit, is P = (R* / a) * (1 + (R_p / R*)) ) / (something). But since R_p is much smaller than R*, we can ignore it for an approximation.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is P = (R*/a) * ( (1 + R_p / R*) ) / (sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2) ) ), but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, for the case where R* << a (which is usually the case), the probability simplifies to approximately (R*/a)^2. Because the area of the star's disk is π(R*)², and the area where the planet can be aligned to cause a transit is roughly the area of the circle with radius a. So the probability is (π R*²) / (π a²) ) = (R*/a)^2. Wait, that makes sense.

So if that's the case, then the transit probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2. Therefore, for each planet, we can compute (R*/a)^2 and compare.

Wait, but both stars have the same radius, R*. So, R* for both is the same. So the probability would be proportional to 1/(a²). So the planet with a smaller a has a higher transit probability.

So we need to find the semi-major axis for each planet.

The semi-major axis a is determined by Kepler's third law. For a star of mass M*, the semi-major axis a is given by a³ = G M* P² / (4 π²). So a = [ (G M* P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3).

Wait, but since both planets have the same minimum mass, but their host stars have different masses. Wait, but in this case, the RV method gives the minimum mass, which is m sin i. But since the question states that both planets have the same masses, we can consider that the actual mass is the same (assuming i=90°, which is the case for a transiting planet). But perhaps in reality, the RV method gives m sin i, so without knowing the inclination, but perhaps for the purpose of this question, the masses are considered the same.

But to calculate the semi-major axis, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period P, the mass of the star M*, and the semi-major axis a.

The formula is a³ = [ G (M* + m_p) P² ] / (4 π² ). Since m_p is much smaller than M*, we can approximate M* + m_p ≈ M*. So a ≈ [ (G M* P² ) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

So the semi-major axis a is proportional to (M* P² )^(1/3 )

Wait, let's compute a for each planet.

For Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2 (since the host star of Planet_1 is twice the mass of Planet_2's host star). Wait, no, the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M*, and M2 = M*, where M* is the mass of Planet_2's host.

And the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

So let's find a1 and a2.

a1 = [ G (2 M*) (P1)^2 / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) = [ G (2 M*) ( (P2/3) )² ]^(1/3 )

= [ G (2 M*) (P2² / 9 ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9) G M* P2² ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G (M*) (P2)^2 / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) = [ G M* P2² ]^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1 / a2 is [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 )

Because a1 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 ) * [ G M* P2² ]^(1/3 ) = [2/9]^(1/3) * a2.

So [2/9] is approximately 0.222, and cube root of that is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 ≈ 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

But wait, let me compute 2/9 numerically. 2 divided by 9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.603. So a1 ≈ 0.603 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive star. So a smaller semi-major axis.

Now, the transit probability P is proportional to (R*/a)^2, and since R* is same for both, P is proportional to 1/a².

So P1/P2 = (a2²) / (a1²) because P is proportional to (1/a)^2.

Wait, because P1 is proportional to (R*/a1)^2 and P2 is proportional to (R*/a2)^2. So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

We have a1 ≈ 0.603 a2. So a2/a1 = 1/0.603 ≈ 1.659.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.659)^2 ≈ 2.75.

So P1 is approximately 2.75 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait! No, that's the opposite. Because a1 is smaller than a2, (R*/a1) is larger, so (R*/a1)^2 is larger, so P1 is larger.

Wait, but wait, in the earlier calculation, a1 is approximately 0.6 a2. So a1 is smaller.

So (R*/a1) is bigger than (R*/a2), so when squared, the ratio is [ (R*/a1)^2 ] / [ (R*/a2)^2 ] = (a2/a1)^2 = (1/0.603)^2 ≈ (1.659)^2 ≈ 2.75.

So P1 is about 2.75 times P2.

Wait, but that would suggest that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

But looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Option C says 1.65 times, which is the ratio of a2/a1, but not squared.

Wait, but according to the calculation, P1 is about 2.75 times P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the correct option would be D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, but I should double-check the reasoning.

Wait, let me re-examine the formula. If transit probability is (R*/a)^2, and a is smaller, then (R*/a) is bigger, so P is bigger.

So for Planet_1, a is smaller, so P is larger.

So yes, Planet_1 has higher probability.

So in options, option D says 2.7 times higher, which aligns with our calculation (approx 2.75). So the answer would be D.

Wait, but were there any factors I missed? Like the mass of the planet? The question says both have the same masses, but in the transit probability, does the planet's mass affect it? I don't think so because in the formula, R_p (planet radius) is much smaller than R*, so it's negligible. The mass of the planet affects the RV method but not the transit probability, which depends on the alignment and the size of the orbit relative to the star.

Another thing to consider: the mass of the star affects the semi-major axis. But I think the calculation accounted for that, since M* is in the Kepler's law.

So yes, the correct choice is D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. For a randomly oriented orbit, the transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability because the planet is closer to its host star, increasing the likelihood of alignment with our line of sight.

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left(M_* P^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star, and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1's host star has \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \), and its orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \).
- Planet_2's host star has \( M_{*,2} \), and its orbital period is \( P_2 \).

Substituting these values, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{*,1} P_1^2}{M_{*,2} P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{*,2} P_2^2 / M_{*,2}}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately \( 0.603 \), so:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.603 \cdot a_2
\]

This means Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Comparing Transit Probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.603} \approx 1.659 \), we find:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} \approx (1.659)^2 \approx 2.75
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.75 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a 1.5 times higher probability.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Planet_1 does not have a 1.65 times higher probability.
- **Option D**: Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 is preferred for observation because it has a significantly higher transit probability due to its smaller semi-major axis.
