Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopy methods. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember each technique gives different kinds of information, so I'll need to analyze each one.

The question says the FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I think that broad peak is probably O-H stretching, like from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad peak, maybe around 2500-3300. So if it's broad around 3000, maybe it's an -OH group, like an alcohol or a phenol. But phenols have a broader O-H, but maybe either is possible.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is usually a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. Wait, but wait, 1700 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone. The 1650 peak is a bit tricky. I think that could be conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Like if there's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached—like in a ketone or maybe an ester. Or maybe an amide, but I don't think so because the options don't have N. So probably something like a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring causing some sort of conjugation.

In the 1H NMR, there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones on a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So that suggests the compound has a double bond somewhere. Maybe a double bond adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester or a ketone. Or maybe it's part of a ring, but more likely a simple double bond.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about what could give that. 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45 (12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 46? Wait, wait: 2*(12+3) = 30 for the two CH3 groups, plus 16 for O is 46. Oh, no, that's 46. Hmm, so maybe another possibility. 45 is also the molecular ion of C3H9O? Or maybe a fragment like an ethyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, 45 could be a ketene ion, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's the tropylium ion? No, that's for benzene derivatives. Alternatively, the fragment could be a result of losing something. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, maybe the ester breaks into the acid and the alcohol. But I'm not certain.

Let me look at the options:

Options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

So looking at the degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate for each.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N here.

For C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU could be a ring plus a double bond, or a triple bond, etc. But wait, if the compound has a double bond (from the vinyl H in NMR) and maybe an ester group, then the DoU would be 2: one from the double bond and another from the carbonyl group.

Wait, let me calculate again. For C6H12O2:

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1.

Hmm, but that suggests only 1 DoU, which would be either a ring or a double bond. But wait, in the IR, we have a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl (DoU of 1), and the 1650 might indicate another DoU, like a double bond. So perhaps the total DoU is 2. That would require the formula to have DoU of 2.

Looking at the options:

C6H12O2: DoU 1. So this would not have enough. Because 2 DoU would require (2C +2 - H)/2 = 2. Let me recalculate.

DoU formula: (2nC +2 - nH - nX + nN)/2. Since no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So that's 1 DoU. But the IR suggests at least two: the carbonyl (1) and another, maybe the vinyl (1). So that would require 2 DoU. So which options have DoU 2?

Let me compute for each:

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU = (14-12)/2=1.

B: C6H10O. DoU=(14-10)/2= (4)/2=2.

C: C6H10O2. DoU= (14-10)/2=4/2=2.

D: C6H12O. DoU= (14-12)/2=1.

So options B and C have DoU 2. Which is what I think the compound needs.

So the compound must have two degrees of unsaturation. That could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So that's one DoU. The IR shows a carbonyl, so that's another. So total DoU is 2, which matches options B and C.

Now, the FTIR has a broad O-H. So the compound has an -OH group. So the formula must include an O in the hydroxyl. Looking at the options, B is C6H10O, which would be something like a diol or an alcohol with a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the O count: option B is O=1, option C is O=2.

The IR also has a peak at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugation, but if the compound has a conjugated double bond or a carbonyl.

Wait, but if the 1650 is a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a substituent, like a carbonyl group attached.

Wait, but if the compound has a carbonyl group, it's probably a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The broad peak at 3000 suggests an -OH, so if it's an acid, the broad O-H would fit. But the 1700 cm^-1 is a bit lower than a carboxylic acid's carbonyl, which is usually around 1700. Wait, no, carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700, but their O-H is broad and strong. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then, if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would include COOH, which is O2.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would have two O's (since COOH is -COOH, which is two oxygens). So looking at the options, option A is C6H12O2, which could be a carboxylic acid. But earlier, the DoU for option A is 1, which is insufficient for a double bond and a carbonyl. Wait, no:

Wait, a carboxylic acid has a carbonyl (DoU 1) and the O-H (but that's not a DoU). But if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond elsewhere, that would add another DoU. So the formula would need to have DoU 2. So a molecule with a double bond and a carbonyl group.

But let me think again. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is O-H. The peaks at 1700 and 1650—so two carbonyl absorptions? Or perhaps one is a carbonyl, the other is a conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring. But in that case, the IR would show a peak around 1450-1600 for aromatic C=C. Wait, but the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ring with a carbonyl substituent, like acetophenone. But in that case, the 1650 might be the ring's stretching.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in a carbonyl group adjacent to a double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

So if the compound has a conjugated carbonyl, that would explain the 1650 cm^-1 peak.

Now, considering the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are on a double bond. So if the compound has a double bond and a carbonyl, perhaps as part of an ester or a ketone.

Wait, the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. Let me think about what that could be. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (which is 45? Wait: 2*(12+3) + 16 = 2*15 +16=30+16=46. Hmm, so 45 is not that. Could it be CH3CO (43?), but maybe it's a fragment of an ester group. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group with some oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at 45 could be a CH2=CH-O group, which would have a molecular weight of 45 (12*2 + 4*1 +16) = 24 +4 +16=44. No, that's 44. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion, which is O=C=O, but that's 64. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the m/z 45 is a fragment from an ethyl group attached to something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a tropylium ion, but that's for benzene derivatives. Wait, but the problem says the 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond, not necessarily a ring.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible structures for each option and see which fits with the observations.

Option A: C6H12O2. Let's see. If it's a diol ester, or perhaps a cyclic ester. Or a molecule with a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, if it's ethyl acrylate, that's CH2=CHCOOEt. But that would have more carbons, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester like a lactone. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is a 5-membered ring with ester group. But that's C4H6O2. Not matching the C6 part.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like methyl vinyl ketone, which is (CH2)C(O)CH2CH3. But that would have the formula C5H8O. Not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that would be C6H10O2. Wait, that's option C. Hmm.

Option C is C6H10O2. So formula would support an ester group, perhaps. Let's see: the ester functional group would have a carbonyl (so peak at ~1700 cm^-1), and the ester oxygen.

The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond, so maybe the ester is derived from a vinyl alcohol? Wait, no, because vinyl alcohol is unstable. Alternatively, the ester could be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

If the structure is an ester with a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate), that's C6H10O2. So the formula would match option C.

But wait, does that structure fit the other data? Let's see: the IR would show a carbonyl at 1700 cm^-1, which matches. The broad peak at 3000 might be the ester R-O-H? No, esters don't have O-H unless it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but in the options, O is present as O2. So perhaps the compound has an OH group as well as an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with a vinyl group. For example, cyclohexenone would have a carbonyl and a double bond. But then the O would be one, but the formula would need to be C6H10O, which is option B.

Wait, but cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Its IR would show a strong peak around 1700 (the ketone). The 1650 peak might not be there, but perhaps some conjugation. Also, the NMR would show vinyl hydrogens (if the cyclohexenone has a double bond, but cyclohexenone has a ring with one double bond and a ketone group. But the O is only one, so that would fit option B.

Wait, but the other IR peak at 1650—what could that be? If the compound has a conjugated double bond, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, then the carbonyl might shift. Alternatively, if there's an aromatic ring, but that would require more DoU.

Hmm, but option B is C6H10O. That would have DoU of 2, which is one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds. If it's a cyclohexenone, that's a ring (DoU 1) and a ketone (DoU 1, but actually, the ketone is part of the ring? Wait, no, the ring is a six-membered with a double bond and a ketone.

Wait, cyclohexenone has a structure like cyclohexene with a ketone. So the structure is a ring (DoU 1, from the ring) plus a double bond (which would add another DoU). But wait, wait, the ring itself is a DoU. The double bond is another. So cyclohexenone has DoU of 2. That fits.

In the IR, the ketone would show a peak around 1700, and the 1650 could be the ring's conjugated system or perhaps another group. Wait, but cyclohexenone's structure is a cyclohexene ring with a ketone. The IR would have the 1700 for the ketone, but where would the 1650 come from? Maybe the ring vibrations, but I'm not certain.

Now, the mass spec: if the compound is cyclohexenone (C6H10O), the molecular weight is 98 (6*12 +10 +16 =72+10+16=98). The fragment at m/z 45 could be a cleavage product. For example, if the ketone breaks off, maybe the methyl group (if any) would leave, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about what fragments would form. For cyclohexenone, maybe the ring breaks and forms a smaller fragment. For example, if it loses a part of the ring, the fragment with the ketone would have a higher m/z, but the 45 is lower. Alternatively, maybe it's a McLafferty rearrangement, but I don't think that would give 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound isn't a ketone, but an ester or an acid.

Wait, another approach: the mass fragment at 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Hmm, no, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2=CH-O group. Wait, the molecular weight of CH2=CH-O- is 44 (12*2 + 4 +16= 44). So maybe the fragment is 44, but the question says 45. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula of the compound is either C6H10O2 or C6H10O. Let's think about possible structures for each.

Option C: C6H10O2. Possible structures: an ester, like methyl something, or a diester. For
