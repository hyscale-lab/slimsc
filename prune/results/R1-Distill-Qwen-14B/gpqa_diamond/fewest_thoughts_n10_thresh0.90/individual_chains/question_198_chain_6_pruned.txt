Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The setup is that we have Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions in solution. The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1, β2, β3, β4 are 9,40,63,16 respectively. So the question is asking what percentage of the cobalt species are the blue dithiocyanato complexes. 

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused. The options are percentages, so we're looking for the fraction of all Co species that are the blue complexes, specifically the dithiocyanato ones. Oh wait, wait, wait. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that. Wait, but sometimes the charge depends on the number of ligands. Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1, so two would make -2, so the overall charge would be +2 -2 = 0? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the charges here. Let me think again. The general formula for a Co(SCN)_n complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+), because Co is +2. So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1). For n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's right. Maybe that's not the main point right now.

The main point is, I think the problem is about complexation equilibria. Cobalt can form complexes with different numbers of SCN- ions. The stability constants (β) are given for each possible complex. So, β1 is for the monodentate complex (n=1), β2 for n=2, β3 for n=3, and β4 for n=4.

Wait, no. Wait a second, I'm a bit confused. Stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to a different number of SCN- ligands. So β1 is for the first complex, say, CoSCN^2+ (n=1), β2 is for the second complex, which would have two SCN- ligands, so Co(SCN)_2^0, β3 is for three, Co(SCN)_3^-2, and β4 for four: Co(SCN)_4^-4? Hmm, but I'm not sure about the charges, but perhaps it doesn't matter for the calculation.

The problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes (n=2) among all the cobalt species. So I need to calculate the fraction of Co that is in the form of the n=2 complex.

Wait, but first, I need
