Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved here. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the Co(SCN)_2 complexes.

Wait, stability constants (β) are for the formation of complexes. So for each complex, the β value is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the ions. For example, β1 is for Co(SCN)_1^2+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^2+, and so on up to β4.

The question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+ (blue) among all cobalt species. So I need to calculate the fraction of Co in each complex and then find what percentage the blue one contributes.

I think the approach is to use the stability constants to find the distribution of each complex. Since the solution has free Co^2+ and SCN-, the complexes will form based on these constants and the concentrations.

But wait, how do I calculate the fraction of each complex?

I remember that the distribution of each complex depends on the stability constant and the concentrations. The fraction f_n of the nth complex can be found using the formula involving the stability constants and the ligand concentrations.

The general formula for the fraction of the nth complex is f_n = (β_n [Co^n SCN^{n}]) / K_total, where K_total is the sum of all β_i [Co^i SCN^i] terms.

Wait, more accurately, I think the fraction f_n is given by f_n = (β_n [Co][SCN]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4)) )

Wait, no. Because βn is for the nth complex, which involves n SCN- ions. So each βn is the formation constant for Co(SCN)_n^{2+n-2}? Or wait, the charge on the complex would be 2+ plus n*(-1), so the overall charge is 2 - n.

But the exact charge might not matter here. The main point is the fractions depend on the product of βn and the ligand concentration to the nth power.

So the formula for the fraction of each complex is f_n = [ βn [SCN]^n ] / [ sum from k=0 to 4 of βk [SCN]^k ]

Wait, no, because k=0 would be [Co^2+], which is when n=0. So for each complex, including the free ion, the fraction is (βn [SCN]^n) / sum over all n of βn [SCN]^n.

So the total in the denominator is β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but what is β0? Because β0 would represent the free ion, Co^2+ itself. So β0 is 1, since it's the standard state.

Yes, that makes sense. So the denominator becomes 1* [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem states that the solution has Co^2+ and SCN^- concentrations. So in solution, the initial [Co^2+] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. But when complexes form, the free [Co^2+] will be lower, and the [SCN^-] will decrease as it binds to Co.

But I think for the purpose of calculating the distribution, it's easier to consider the free [Co^2+] (let's call it [Co]) and the free [SCN^-]. Wait, but wait, the complexes are formed from the free ions. So the total concentration of Co is the sum of all the complexes and the free Co^2+.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the distribution using the conditional formation constants.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the assumption that the concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and the concentration of SCN is 0.1 M. But the formation of complexes will shift these concentrations.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the total Co is 1e-2 M, and the SCN is in excess (0.1 M is much higher than the amount that might be consumed in forming complexes), so that [SCN] remains approximately 0.1 M.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think again. The concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, and the Co is 0.01 M. Since Co forms complexes with SCN in a 1:n ratio, for each mole of Co that forms a n=4 complex, it would consume 4 moles of SCN. But the total Co is 0.01 M, so maximum SCN that could be consumed is 0.04 M. But the initial [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is much higher. So the assumption that [SCN] remains approximately 0.1 M might be valid.

Therefore, we can approximate [SCN] as 0.1 M, and [Co] as the free Co^2+ concentration, which is much lower than the initial 0.01 M because most Co is complexed.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the total concentration of Co is 0.01 M. Let's denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentrations of the complexes are:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (β_n [Co][SCN]^n) / β_0, where β_0 is 1.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the fractions are given by f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum over k β_k [SCN]^k )

But then, the total [Co] is sum [Co(SCN)_n] + [Co^2+] = 0.01 M.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the fraction of each species. Let me formalize this.

The fraction of each complex is f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k )

But wait, when n=0, [SCN]^0 is 1, so β_0 would be 1 in that term.

So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

The numerator for f_n is β_n [SCN]^n.

But wait, if [Co] is 0.01 M, but the total is split among the complexes and the free ion. So the sum of all f_n should be 1.

Wait, no. Because each f_n is the fraction of Co in that complex. So the sum of f_n from n=0 to 4 is 1.

Because the fractions are based on the total Co.

So, the total [Co] is 0.01 M. So the [Co(SCN)_n] is (f_n) * 0.01 M.

But since [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is much higher, we can treat it as constant.

Therefore, f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k )

So in this case, [SCN] is 0.1 M.

So let's compute each term in the denominator: 1, β1*(0.1), β2*(0.1)^2, β3*(0.1)^3, β4*(0.1)^4.

Calculating each term:

β0 term: 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1.

β1 term: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

β2 term: 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

β3 term: 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063.

β4 term: 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016.

Sum these up: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; 1.9 +0.4=2.3; 2.3 +0.063=2.363; 2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for each complex is:

f0 = (β0 [SCN]^0) / denominator = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4225.

f1 = (9 * 0.1) / 2.3646 = 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.3807.

f2 = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1691.

f3 = (63 * 0.001) / 2.3646 = 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266.

f4 = (16 * 0.0001) / 2.3646 = 0.0016 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.000677.

So the fractions are approximately:

f0: ~42.25%

f1: ~38.07%

f2: ~16.91%

f3: ~2.66%

f4: ~0.0677%.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question asks for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Which one is that? The blue one is Co(SCN)_2^2+ I think, which is the n=2 complex.

So the fraction f2 is about 16.91%.

But looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that's the answer?

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator:

β0: 1

β1: 9*(0.1) = 0.9

β2:40*(0.1)^2= 40*0.01=0.4

β3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

β4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum=1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

Yes, correct.

Now, f2: (40 * 0.01 ) / 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute 0.4 / 2.3646.

What's 2.3646 × 0.169 = approx 0.4.

Because 2.3646 × 0.169 ≈ 0.4.

Wait, 2.3646 × 0.169 ≈ 0.4?

Wait, let's compute 2.3646 × 0.169.

2.3646 * 0.1 =0.23646.

2.3646 * 0.06 =0.141876.

2.3646 * 0.009=0.0212814.

Adding them: 0.23646 +0.141876=0.378336 +0.0212814=0.3996.

Hmm, so 2.3646 × 0.169 ≈ 0.3996, which is almost 0.4.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%.

So f2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but I thought the blue complex was the dithiocyanato, which is Co(SCN)_2^2+.

So yes, the percentage is 16.9%, so the answer is D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)₂²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co²
