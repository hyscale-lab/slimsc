Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about a star with certain characteristics and some dark spots on it, and how that affects the brightness variations observed when the star rotates. The problem is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots.

Let me read the problem again to make sure I get the details right. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star is same as R_sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, this causes brightness variations because the spots come into and out of view. The question says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. We need to find the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the star's radius that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Wait, the key point is that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is being compared to the variation caused by an exoplanet. So, the amplitude of the brightness change (the depth of the dip) caused by the spots is what we have to model, and that should be equal to the dip caused by the planet.

So, let me think about how each effect contributes to the change in brightness.

First, the star's total brightness. The star emits light based on its surface area and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σTeff^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we're dealing with variations, maybe we can consider the fractional change in brightness.

When a spot is on the surface, it's darker, so when that part of the star is facing us, the total brightness we observe decreases. The spots cover a certain fraction of the star's surface. The filling factor is 20%, which means 20% (or 0.2) of the hemisphere is covered. But wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So the total area covered in spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, a hemisphere's area is 2πR². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R². But wait, no, that's if the entire hemisphere is filled with spots. But the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So each spot covers a small area, and the filling factor is the total fraction. So the total area covered is (filling factor)* (area of hemisphere). So yes, 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, when the star rotates, the spots can come into view. So when aligned with our line of sight, the spots contribute less light. So the change in brightness will depend on how much of the spots are visible as the star rotates.

Wait, the problem says that the star is observed to have brightness variations due to rotational modulation. So each spot is on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view as the star spins. Since it's a single hemisphere, perhaps the spots are on the surface such that when the star shows that face, we see the spots.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the brightness change. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the brightness is lower. The amplitude of the dip depends on the area of the spots relative to the star's surface.

Wait, but the star's total brightness is the sum of the light from the spots and the rest of the surface. The spots are cooler, so they emit less. So when the spots are facing us, their lower brightness reduces the total. So the fractional change in brightness would be (ΔL / L_total), where ΔL is the change in luminosity due to the spots.

Wait, let's model this.

The star's normal brightness is L0 = 4π R_star² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the brightness is L = L0 - (number of spot areas) × (L per unit area of spot).

Wait, the spot area is A_spots = filling factor × (area of hemisphere) = 0.2 * (2 π R_star²) = 0.4 π R_star².

But each spot has a lower temperature, T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the luminosity of the spots when they're facing us is A_spots * σ T_spot^4. But when the hemisphere is not facing us, those spots are not contributing, so their absence would mean we see the rest of the star's surface.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's brightness when the spots are on the side. The star's brightness is a combination of the unspotted area and the spotted area. So the total brightness when spots are visible is L = (1 - filling factor) * (area fraction) * L0 + (filling factor) * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) * L0.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the relative change in brightness.

The unspotted surface emits at Teff, and the spotted area emits less. So when the spots are facing us, the change in brightness is (L_unspotted + L_spots) / (L_unspotted + L_spots when the spots are on the other side).

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the fractional change as (L_spots - L_unspots) / L_total.

Wait, let me think again.

The star's total brightness without any spots would be L0 = 4π R² σ T^4.

When the spots are present, each spot contributes an area A_spot = 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². The temperature of the spot is T_spot = 5000 K.

So the total luminosity from the spots when they're facing us is A_spot * σ T_spot^4.

The rest of the star's surface is (4π R² - A_spot) * σ T_eff^4. So the total brightness is [ (4π R² - A_spot) T_eff^4 + A_spot T_spot^4 ] * σ.

But when the star is viewed without the spots, the brightness is 4π R² T_eff^4 σ.

The change in brightness (ΔL) is the difference between these two. So:

ΔL = [ (4π R² T_eff^4) - ( (4π R² - A_spot) T_eff^4 + A_spot T_spot^4 ) ) ] * σ

= [ (4π R² T_eff^4) - (4π R² T_eff^4 - A_spot T_eff^4 + A_spot T_spot^4 ) ) ] * σ

= [ A_spot (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] * σ

So the fractional change in brightness (ΔL / L_total) is [ A_spot (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 π R² T_eff^4 )

But A_spot is 0.4 π R², as I said earlier. Plugging that in:

ΔL/L = [ 0.4 π R² (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) ] / (4 π R² Teff^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

π R² cancels out. 0.4 in numerator, 4 in denominator.

So 0.4 /4 = 0.1.

So:

ΔL/L = 0.1 * (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) / Teff^4

= 0.1 * [ 1 - (Tspot / Teff)^4 ]

Tspot is 5000 K, Teff is 6000 K.

So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Calculating (5/6)^4: 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

So ΔL/L ≈ 0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.0517747, or about 5.177% change in brightness.

Wait, but is this the amplitude of the brightness variation? Because when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, so the maximum dip would be when the maximum area of spots is visible.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view as the hemisphere faces us, and then when it rotates away, we don't see them anymore. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spot area is visible, which is what I've calculated above, 5.177% dip.

Wait, wait a second. But the problem says that the star's one hemisphere is covered, and when it rotates, only that hemisphere's spots are visible. So the star's rotation would cause the spots to sweep across the view. But to calculate the maximum dip, perhaps the fraction is when the entire spot area is visible, yes.

So the amplitude of the brightness change is about 5.177% of the star's total brightness.

Now, the problem is comparing this to the brightness change caused by a planet transiting in front of the star. The dip in brightness when a planet transits is given by the area of the planet's disk relative to the star's disk. Because the planet blocks some of the star's light.

The area of the planet is π R_planet², and the area of the star is π R_star². So the fractional area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

The dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So we need this dip (ΔL/L) to be equal to what we calculated for the spots, which is about 5.177%.

So set up the equation:

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.05177

Taking square roots:

R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, wait but wait. Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the dip caused by the planet is when the planet's disk covers part of the star, blocking light. So the dip is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Wait, but in the case of the spots, the dip is due to the spots being cooler, not blocking light. So the dip is due to the spots being less bright. So the two situations are different: one is a spot causing a dimmer area to be visible, the other is an object blocking light.

So in the case of the spot, the dip is about 5.177%. For the planet, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

We want them to have the same dip amplitude, so (R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.05177.

So R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, which is approximately 0.23.

But looking at the options, the options are A) 0.39, B) 0.07, C) 0.11, D) 0.32.

Hmm, none of these match 0.23. So did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ΔL/L calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, when I calculated the fractional change, I considered the entire spot area being visible, but the star's rotation may not show the entire spot all at once. Wait, no, because the star's hemisphere is covered, so when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the entire spot area is visible. So my calculation should be correct.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

ΔL/L = 0.1 * [1 - (5/6)^4] = 0.1 * [1 - (625/1296)] = 0.1 * [ (1296 - 625)/1296 ] = 0.1 * (671 / 1296) ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177.

So yes, that part is correct.

So the planet's radius over the star's radius is sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, which is about 0.23 R_star.

But none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is D) 0.32 (which is about 0.32), and C) 0.11 is about 0.11.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the spot area.

Wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the area covered by spots is 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, the area of a hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

But when the star isn't rotating, the spot hemisphere is facing us. So the total area of the star is 4π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1, or 10%.

Wait, but I thought the filling factor was 20% of the hemisphere. So that's correct. So the area is 0.4 π R², but the total star area is 4 π R². So the fraction is 0.1. So when the spots are on the side, 10% of the star's surface is spots.

So the calculation of ΔL/L = 0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4) is correct.

Wait, let me recalculate (5/6)^4.

5^4=625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 is approximately 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.051775, which is about 5.1775% dip.

So the planet's dip must be this value. So (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.051775.

Taking square root: R_p/R_star ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, which is approximately 0.23.

But in the options, the closest is option C) ~0.11 (0.11^2=0.0121; no, that's too small) or option D) 0.32 (0.32^2=0.1024, which is about 10.24% dip; that's bigger than 5.177%.)

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot's effect.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The brightness variation due to spots is when the spots come into and out of view as the star rotates. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, but perhaps the average dip isn't that.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the entire spot as being visible all at once. Because the star's rotation might mean that only part of the spot is visible at any time.

Wait, no, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered with spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the entire spot area is visible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. The problem says the star's one hemisphere is
