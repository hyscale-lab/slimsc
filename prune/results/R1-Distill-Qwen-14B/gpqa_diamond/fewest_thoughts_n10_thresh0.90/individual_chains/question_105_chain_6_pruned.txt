Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of this star has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. The astronomers are observing this star and notice brightness variations because the spots are causing rotational modulation. The setup is similar to what an exoplanet would do, so the question is asking what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation as these spots.

Wait, but the question is a bit tricky. It says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would the exoplanet's radius have to be to produce the same amplitude signal in the light curve. So, the idea is that the spots on the star cause a dip in brightness when they rotate into view, similar to a planet blocking the star's light (transit method). 

So, the amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area blocked relative to the star's area. For a planet, the blocked area is the area of the planet's disk as seen from the star. The star's area is, well, the star's disk. So the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2 times the star's light.

But in this case, the star's spots are causing the variation. So, the dip caused by the spots would be proportional to the area of the spots. The problem states that the filling factor is 20% â€” I think that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Wait, does that mean the entire star has 10% coverage because only one hemisphere is spotty? Because if one hemisphere has 20% spots, the total area covered is 0.2 * (0.5 * surface area) = 0.1 of the total surface area. So the filling factor of the entire star would be 20% on one hemisphere, so 10% overall? Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Wait, filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the surface covered. So if one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, then the total spots cover 20% of the star's surface. Because a hemisphere is half the surface, 20% of that is
