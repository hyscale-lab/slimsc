Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? 

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe some of them have the same energy, so I can group them.

Let me think about all possible states. Each S can be +1 or -1. But instead of listing all 8, maybe I can find the possible values of the energy expression. The energy expression is -J times the sum of the products of each pair. So, E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Wait, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take different values depending on the spins. Let's denote each term as follows: let’s compute possible values.

Wait, each product S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. So, the sum could be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Because each of the three terms (S1S2, S1S3, S2S3) can be +1 or -1. So, how many ways can the sum be 3? That would be when all three products are +1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Let's see what that implies for the spins.

If S1S2=1, then S2 = S1. Similarly, S1S3=1 implies S3 = S1. And S2S3=1 implies S3 = S2. So all three spins are the same. So, all +1 or all -1. How many such states are there? Two: all +1 and all -1.

In that case, the sum is 3, so E = -J * 3. So, each of these two states has energy -3J. Wait, each state is a particular combination of the spins. So when all spins are +1, E is -3J. When all are -1, each product is (-1)(-1)=1, so again the sum is 3, so E = -3J.

So, two states contribute exp(β*3J), since E is negative. Wait, no. The energy is E = -3J, so the exponent is -β E = β*3J.

But wait, the partition function is the sum of exp(-β E), no? Because Z = sum exp(-β E_i). So E_i is the energy of state i.

Wait, let me double-check. The formula for partition function is sum_{i} exp(-β E_i). So for each state, compute exp(-β E_i), where E_i is its energy.

So for the two states where all spins are same, E_i is -3J. So exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3J β). So each contributes e^{3Jβ}, and since there are two such states, their contribution is 2 e^{3Jβ}.

Now, what about the other states? Let's consider the next possible sum: 1. How can the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 equal 1? Let me think.

Let’s suppose two of the products are +1 and one is -1. So 2*(+1) + 1*(-1) = 2 -1 =1. So the sum is 1. So E = -J *1 = -J. So those states have energy -J.

How many such states are there? Let me see. Each combination where two products are +1 and one is -1. 

Wait, but the products are S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Let me think about the possible spin configurations.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the possible spin configurations and count how many have a sum of 1.

Wait, another approach: the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ) / 2. Because expanding (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 gives S1² + S2² + S3² + 2S1S2 + 2S1S3 + 2S2S3. So, (S1+S2+S3)^2 = sum S_i² + 2 sum S_i S_j. 

Since each S_i is either +1 or -1, S_i² =1. So sum S_i² =3. So,

(S1+S2+S3)^2 = 3 + 2 (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). 

Rearranging, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1+S2+S3)^2 -3 ] / 2.

So the sum depends on (S1+S2+S3)^2. Let me compute that.

If all three are same: sum is 3 or -3. So their squares are 9. So (9-3)/2=3. So sum is 3.

If two are same and one different. Let's say S1 = S2 ≠ S3. Then sum S1 + S2 + S3 = 2*(+1) + (-1) = +1, or 2*(-1) + (+1) = -1. So (sum)^2 is 1. So the sum becomes (1-3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. So the sum S1S2 + ... would be -1, so E=-J*(-1)=J.

Wait, wait. Let me go back. If the sum of the three spins squared is 1, then [1-3]/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. So sum of the products is -1. So the energy E is -J*(-1) = J.

So in this case, the energy is J. 

How many states have two spins up and one down, or two down and one up? Let's see: for two up and one down, there are C(3,2)=3 possibilities (which spin is down). Similarly, for two down and one up, another 3 possibilities. So total 6 states with sum of two same and one different.

Each of these 6 states has energy J. So their contribution to Z is 6 * exp( -β * J ), because E=J.

Wait, no. Wait, E is J, so exp(-β E) = exp(-β J). So each of those 6 states contributes e^{-β J}, so their total is 6 e^{-β J}.

Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check. For two up and one down, sum is 1? Or is it -1? Because earlier, when S1=S2 but not S3, the sum of the products is -1. So E= -J*(-1) = J.

No, wait. The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is [ (S1+S2+S3)^2 -3 ] /2. So when sum is 1, the sum of products is (1-3)/2= -1. So the energy is -J*(-1) = J. So yes, E=J.

So for these 6 states, each contributes exp(-β*J) = e^{-β J}.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the energy for the two all-same states was -3J, so for E=-3J, exp(-β*(-3J)) = e^{3J β}.

So putting it all together: the partition function Z is sum of all terms.

So the two states with E=-3J contribute 2 e^{3 J β}.

The six states with E=J contribute 6 e^{- J β}.

Wait, wait wait. Wait, no, because E is J, so exp(-β E) is exp(-β J). But earlier, when all spins are same, E=-3J, so exp(-β*(-3J))=e^{3Jβ}.

So Z is 2 e^{3 J β} + 6 e^{- J β}.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}

Option C: 2e^{2Jβ} +6e^{-2Jβ}

Option D: 6e^{2Jβ} +2e^{-2Jβ}

So our calculation gives 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}, which is option B.

But wait, did I mix up J and signs somewhere? Let's double-check.

Wait, the energy is E = -J [sum of products]. So when the sum is 3, E is -J *3. So E is -3J. So exp(-β E) = exp(3 J β). So yes, that's correct.

When sum is -1, E is -J*(-1) = J. So exp(-beta E) = exp(-beta J). So yes, that contributes 6 e^{-J beta}.

So the partition function is 2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{- J β}, which is option B.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any states I missed? For three spins, 8 states in total. The two all same (sum 3), and the six where two are same and one different (sum -1). So correct, 8 states accounted for.

So the answer should be option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Possible Energy Values
The energy depends on the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), which can take the values \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \) depending on the spin configurations. Using the identity \( (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \), and noting that \( S_i^2 = 1 \) for all \( i \), the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) is related to \( (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 \) as:
\[
S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = \frac{(S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 - 3}{2}.
\]
Thus, the possible values of \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) are:
- \( 3 \) when all spins are the same (\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 \)),
- \( -1 \) when two spins are the same and one is different.

### Step 2: Energy for Each Configuration
- For the two states where all spins are the same (\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 \)), the energy is:
  \[
  E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J.
  \]
- For the six states where two spins are the same and one is different, the energy is:
  \[
  E = -J \cdot (-1) = J.
  \]

### Step 3: Contributions to the Partition Function
The partition function is:
\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]
- For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the contribution is:
  \[
  2 \cdot e^{-\beta (-3J)} = 2 \cdot e^{3J\beta}.
  \]
- For the six states with \( E = J \), the contribution is:
  \[
  6 \cdot e^{-\beta J}.
  \]

### Step 4: Final Expression for \( Z \)
Combining these contributions, the partition function is:
\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 5: Matching with Options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect signs in exponents).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect coefficients and exponents).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.
