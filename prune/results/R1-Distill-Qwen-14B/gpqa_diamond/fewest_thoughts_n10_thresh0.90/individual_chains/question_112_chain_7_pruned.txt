Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, this is a spin-½ system, I think. The state is given as a linear combination of these two basis states.

The first part asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So, the matrix A would look like this:

[[0, ħ/2],
[ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, no wait. The question says Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements A11 and A22 are 0, and A12 and A21 are ħ/2. So the matrix is correct as I wrote.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because operators usually have their own eigenstates. So the operator A has these elements, which probably corresponds to some spin component. Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices have similar structures. Let me think: The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? And the operator for spin in the x-direction is (ħ/2) σ_x, which would be [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. So exactly the matrix we have here. So operator A is the spin x operator. So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the x-component of spin.

Wait, but why does the question say 'the operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij' — so operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, which are |+x> and |-x> perhaps. So when the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A, that means the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, and we need to find the probabilities of collapsing into each.

But wait, wait. The given state is in the z-basis. So we need to express |alpha> in the x-basis, which are the eigenstates of A, and then find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenstates of operator A, then find the coefficients when |alpha> is written in terms of these eigenstates. The square of the absolute value of each coefficient will be the probability of measuring that eigenstate.

So the plan is:

1. Normalize |alpha>. Because the problem says |alpha> is proportional to that vector. So first, we need to compute the normalization factor.

2. Express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A.

3. Find the probabilities as the square of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

4. Then compute the average value of operator A, which is the expectation value.

Let me start with step 1: Normalizing |alpha>.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Compute each coefficient:

Coefficient for |up>: (1 + i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Coefficient for |down>: (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, step 2: Find the eigenstates of operator A.

Operator A has matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Its eigenstates are the eigenvectors of this matrix. Since it's proportional to σ_x, which has eigenvalues ±1. So operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) respectively. So the eigenstates of A would be the same, but scaled by some factor due to the operator's matrix elements.

Wait, but wait. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's, which are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, we need to find the expansion coefficients.

Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So any state can be written as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. Let's write |alpha> as a combination:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

So substituting the expressions:

c_+ = < +x | alpha > = [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ].

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, which are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

We can write |alpha> as a linear combination:

|alpha> = a |+x>
