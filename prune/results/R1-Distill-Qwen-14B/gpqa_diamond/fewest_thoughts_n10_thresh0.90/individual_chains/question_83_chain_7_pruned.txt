Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about titration of acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it should form acetate ions and water.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both pH values and see which option matches.

First, let me think about the initial steps. When you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial concentration is 0.05 M in 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration before titration would be half of the original, right? Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. The initial moles of acetic acid are volume (L) times molarity. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. At equivalence point, moles of NaOH would equal moles of acetic acid.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is still 0.001 moles. So for equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait but wait, the problem is asking for pH at 25% titration and equivalence. So first, for the 25% titration.

25% of the equivalence point volume. Since equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% would be 2.5 cm³. So at this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's calculate moles of NaOH added in 2.5 cm³. Volume is 0.0025 L. Moles = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

So the reaction is 1:1. So moles of CH3COOH that have reacted is 0.00025. Initial moles of CH3COOH after dilution was 0.001. So remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of CH3COO^- produced are 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but after adding NaOH, the solution's volume increases. So the total volume is original solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³), which is 42.5 cm³ (0.042
