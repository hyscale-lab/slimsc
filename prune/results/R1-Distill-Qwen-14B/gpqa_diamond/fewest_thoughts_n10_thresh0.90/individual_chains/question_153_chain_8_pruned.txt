Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolates acting as nucleophiles attacking alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each being a reaction. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base, so it should deprotonate the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form a resonance-stabilized enolate.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, I think it's actually CH2CH2 with the substituents. Oh wait, the acrylate has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, so the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the (E) configuration would have the p-tolyl on one side and the ester on the other. Wait, no, the substituents on the double bond would be on the same carbon. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is probably CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) ester. No, wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO-O- something, but 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-R. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, I think I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH–CO-OCH2-C6H4–p-tolyl? No, the (E) configuration would have the substituents on opposite sides. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)–O–CH3. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it's better to think about the reaction mechanism.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta position of the alpha
