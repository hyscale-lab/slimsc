Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying numbers of hydrogens and oxygen atoms.

The data given includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me break down each of these.

Starting with the FTIR. There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak is more typical of an alcohol. Oh, wait, but carboxylic acids also have broad O-H stretches. Hmm, but another thing: the presence of two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are probably carbonyl groups. The 1700 is around where ketones or maybe esters would be, and the 1650 could be conjugated carbonyls, like an acid or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Oh, wait, but 1650 might also be an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not that.

So combining the O-H and the two carbonyl peaks. Maybe it's a compound with both a carbonyl group and an O-H group. Could it be something like a ketone with an alcohol, or perhaps a carboxylic acid? But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad and maybe a peak around 1700 for the carbonyl. But then why two peaks? Oh, maybe one is a carbonyl and another is an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like in a benzene ring, maybe with a substituent causing the ring to absorb at that region). So perhaps it's an aromatic ketone or something like that.

Now onto the 1H NMR. It says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl means sp² hybridized carbons, so that suggests double bonds, like in alkenes or maybe in an aromatic ring. So the compound probably has some double bonds. So like an alkene or an aromatic ring. The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR supports that.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments have a mass of 45? Let me think. Common fragments: maybe a ketone group (like (CH3)2CO would lose some parts, but not sure. Alternatively, (CH3)2CO is 58. Hmm. Another thought: the fragment at 45 could be a CH2CH2O group? Wait, 45 is the mass. Let me calculate the possible combinations. 45 can be C3H7O (3*12=36 +7=7 +16=16? 36+7+16=60? Wait, no. Wait, 45 = 12*3 + 1*7 + 16*1? 36+7 is 43, plus 16 is 59. No, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's the tropylium ion? Or perhaps a fragment from an ester. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, 45 could be the mass of a (CH2)2O group... Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group but that's more like 45? Let me calculate: CH2CH2O would be (12*2 + 1*4 +16) → 24 +4=28 +16=44. Close but not 45. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2CH3O group? No, that would be 45? Wait, CH2CH3O is CH3CH2O, the mass would be (12*2)+(1*5)+16 → 24+5=29+16=45. Oh, yeah! So CH2CH2O would be 45. Wait, no, CH2CH3O is (CH2CH3-O-), so the fragment could be something like (CH2CH3-O-) which would have a mass of 45.

But wait, what compounds would lose a fragment that leaves a 45 mass? Maybe in an ester or an ether. Alternatively, the fragment could be something else. Another possibility is the fragment (CH3)CO, which is 58? No, that's higher than 45. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketene group or something else. Hmm, not sure. But if the mass is 45, and it's a fragment, perhaps the compound has an ethoxy group, like in an ester or ether.

Putting this together: the compound has O-H (from the broad peak), two carbonyl groups (from 1700 and 1650 cm-1), and vinyl hydrogens (so maybe double bonds or aromatic rings). So possible structures could be something like a substituted benzaldehyde, a ketone with an alcohol, or perhaps a beta-keto alcohol.

Wait, but the formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So possible degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) calculation: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. Let's compute for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 → (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. That could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, if the compound has two carbonyl groups, like a ketone and an ester, then each carbonyl is a double bond. So two DoU. But the formula A has one DoU. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 → (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could account for two double bonds or a ring plus a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU = (14 -10)/2=2. So same as option B, two DoU. But with two oxygen atoms.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU.

Wait, but the IR shows two carbonyl peaks, which are two DoU. So the compound must have two DoU from carbonyls. Unless one is a carbonyl and another is an aromatic ring. So let's think again.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650. Hmm, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with an adjacent double bond, or maybe an aromatic ring with a substituent (like in an aromatic ketone where the ring's vibrations shift). Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or amide, but amides aren't in the options.

Alternatively, if the 1650 is an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching), but then where's the carbonyl? Wait, maybe the compound is an aromatic ketone. So, benzene ring (which is 4 DoU by itself?), wait no. Benzene ring has 3 DoU (three double bonds). But if the molecule has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, that would add another DoU. So total DoU would be 4, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, but in the IR, the peaks are at 1700 and 1650. So maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring's C=C. So, benzene ring (which would have C=C at around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹). If the 1650 is the ring's stretching, then the 1700 is a carbonyl. So that would make sense. So the compound could be something like acetophenone (phenyl ketone), but then what about the O-H peak?

Wait, the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH group. So if it's a phenolic compound, like phenol derivative, but phenol doesn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, if it's a ketone with a hydroxyl group, like a ketone and an alcohol.

But if the compound has both a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a hydroxyl group, that would account for two DoU (the ketone is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, and the aromatic ring is four DoU in total? Wait, no, benzene is three DoU. So the total DoU would be 3 (from benzene) + 1 (from ketone) = 4. But wait, the formula must match.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formulas again. The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → DoU=1.

B) C6H10O → DoU=2.

C) C6H10O2 → DoU=2.

D) C6H12O → DoU=1.

Wait, but if the compound has a benzene ring (3 DoU), a ketone (1 DoU), and an -OH group, that's three DoU. So the formula needs to have DoU=4? But none of the options have that. Oh, but perhaps the benzene ring is not present. Maybe it's a conjugated dienone or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 peak is not from an aromatic ring but from another conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. For example, a compound with a conjugated double bond next to a carbonyl (like an enone), which would have a C=C peak around 1650 and a carbonyl peak at 1700.

So, let's think: a compound with a conjugated enone (so two DoU: the double bond and the carbonyl) and an -OH group (another DoU from the ring? Or is the -OH not adding a DoU? Wait, no, the -OH is just a functional group without adding a DoU.

But wait, the formula must match the DoU. So let's consider the options again.

If the compound has an enone (two DoU: one from the double bond, one from the carbonyl) and an -OH group (which doesn't add a DoU), then the total DoU would be 2.

Looking at the options, options B and C have DoU=2. So the formula would be either C6H10O or C6H10O2.

But the IR shows an O-H stretch, so the compound must have an -OH group. So that's an oxygen in the formula. So the options are B (O=1) and C (O=2).

If the compound is an enol (conjugated double bond and an -OH, like a hydroxyl group adjacent to a carbonyl), then the formula would be C6H10O. Because enols are generally CnH2nO. Let me see: for a six-carbon enol, it would be C6H10O. So that would match option B.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are sp², so that fits with the double bond in an enol.

The mass spec has a fragment at 45. If the formula is C6H10O (option B), what would fragment to give m/z 45?

Wait, the molecular weight of option B is (12*6)+(10*1)+16 = 72+10+16=98. So the molecular ion would be at 98. But the fragment is at 45, which is exactly half. So maybe it's a fragment that's losing a part of the molecule, like losing a CH2CH2O group? Wait, earlier I thought CH2CH3O is 45. So if the molecule has a CH2CH3O group, that would be 45. But how would that fit into the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an ester group. An ester group would have the formula O-CO-O-R. But that would require more oxygens. Wait, but option B has only one O. So ester (which has two oxygens) can't be in option B. So perhaps it's a hemiacetal or some other structure, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: the fragment at m/z 45 could be from a ketone losing a certain part. For example, if the molecule is (CH3)2COH (but that's only 3 carbons). Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to think of each option.

Option B: C6H10O. Possible structures: an enol (like hexenol), or perhaps a cyclic ether with a double bond. But with an O-H group, it's probably an alcohol with a double bond.

But the IR has a peak at 1700 and 1650, which suggests carbonyl groups. So maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. Wait, but in a six-carbon molecule, a cyclic ketone would be cyclohexanone, but then where's the O-H? That would make it cyclohexanol with a ketone? But cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone, but that would be C6H10O. Wait, cyclohexanone is C6H10O (formula: C6H10O). So it's 6 carbons, 10 H, 1 O. Wait, but cyclohexanone has a ketone, so the IR should have a peak at around 1700. But what about the peak at 1650? If the ring is not conjugated, maybe that's another group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dienone, like 1,4-diketone. But that would have two carbonyl groups, so two peaks in IR. So the FTIR would make sense.

Wait, but 1,4-diketone would have two carbonyl groups, so two peaks. However, the formula for a 1,4-diketone with 6 carbons would be C6H8O2, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ketone plus an alcohol, but I'm not seeing how the formula would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with an alcohol group. But an ester has two oxygens, so the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C). Let's think about that.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So two double bonds or a ring plus a double bond. Let's see.

If it's an ester, like methyl something. But let's think about the structure. An ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. If it's a six-carbon ester, perhaps like methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate? But that would have a ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond.

But wait, the IR has a broad O-H peak. Esters don't have O-H groups. Oh, wait, unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups: one from the ketone and one from the ester. So the IR would show peaks around 1700 (ester) and 1750 (ketone?), but I'm not sure about the exact wavenumbers. Alternatively, maybe the two carbonyls are in conjugation, which shifts their peaks.

Wait, in a beta-keto ester, the ketone is usually around 1700, and the ester carbonyl could be around 1740. Hmm, but the FTIR shows 1700 and 1650. So perhaps the conjugation shifts the ester carbonyl down to 1650. That could fit.

So the structure could be something like ethyl acetoacetate. Wait, but that's a five-carbon compound. Alternatively, a six-carbon beta-keto ester.

If the formula is C6H10O2, that fits a beta-keto ester. Let's calculate: the general formula for a beta-keto ester is RCOCH2COOR'. So for a six-carbon molecule, if R is methyl (CH3) and R' is propyl, for example. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let's think of the molecular formula.

Ethyl acetoacetate is CH3COCH2COOCH2CH3. Its formula is C5H8O3. Not matching, so perhaps another structure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted cyclopentanone with an ester group. Let's not get stuck on that. The point is, the formula C6H10O2 has two oxygens, which would allow for an ester group and an O-H group. Wait, no, esters don't have O-H. Wait, unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a fragment at m/z 45 could suggest that the molecule has a (CH3CH2O) group, which has a mass of 45. So if the molecule is something like (CH2CH3O)COOR', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ortho ester or something else. Alternatively, the fragment could be from an acetylation. Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But a lactone would have a ring, which would add to the DoU.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible structures that match each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. If this is the formula, the structure could be something like methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate. Wait, but that would be C7H10O2. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted benzaldehyde with an ester group. Wait, benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45. Assuming the molecular formula is C6H10O2, what could fragment to 45. Let's calculate molecular weight. C6H10O2 is (6*12)=72 + (10*1)=10 + (2*16)=32 → 72+10=82 +32=114. So molecular weight 114. So a fragment at 45 is about 40% of the molecular weight. Perhaps it's losing a larger fragment. Wait, if the molecule is, say, (CH2CH2O)COOCH2CH3, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is something like phenyl acetate. Phenyl acetate is C6H5COOCH2Ph? Wait, no, phenyl acetate is C6H5COOCH2Ph? No, more accurately, it's benzyl acetate: CH3COOCH2C6H5. Wait, but that's C9H10O2. No, that doesn't fit. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alpha-hydroxy ester. For example, something like CH3CH(OH)COOR. But that would have an O-H group and two carbonyls (one from the ester and perhaps a ketone). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diacid ester. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, think of the NMR. It says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So perhaps the molecule has double bonds, like an alkene or an aromatic ring. The IR has a peak at 1650, which could be an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the presence of an aromatic ring would mean higher DoU. Let's recalculate DoU for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2 → DoU= (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

Option B: C6H10O → (14-10)/2=2.

Option C: C6H10O2 → (14-10)/2=2.

Option D: C6H12O → (14-12)/2=1.

So if the compound has an aromatic ring (which is three DoU) plus a carbonyl (one DoU), that would be four DoU. But none of the options have that. So perhaps the 1650 cm−1 peak is not from a ring but from a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone.

So, perhaps the structure is something like an enone. For example, cyclopentanone with a double bond adjacent. But that would be C5H8O. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach: the FTIR has a strong absorption at 1700 and 1650. Which functional groups could that be? 1700 is a carbonyl group, such as a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C) or conjugated carbonyl.

If it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone, then the structure would have a double bond next to the carbonyl. So the structure would be something like RCOCH2CH2CH2... but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the FTIR has a broad O-H peak, which is probably an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests two different carbonyl groups. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, which fits the FTIR. But a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700. But why two peaks? Unless it's a diacid or a conjugated system.

Wait, but the options don't have a diacid formula. So perhaps it's not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-diketone. Beta-diketones have two carbonyl groups. So, the IR would show two peaks, one around 1700 and another perhaps a bit lower due to conjugation. The O-H would be from an alcohol group. So the structure would have a beta-diketone and an -OH group.

Looking at the options, which formula fits a six-carbon beta-diketone with an -OH group. Hmm, let's see.

Formula C6H10O2 could be a beta-diketone with an alcohol group. For example, suppose the structure is something like HOCH2COCH2COCH2COCH3. Wait, that's 6 carbons: C-O-C-O-C-O-C, but that's more like an ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic beta-diketone with an -OH group. For instance, a cyclic structure with two ketone groups and an -OH.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: let's think about the options again.

Option A is C6H12O2. DoU is 1. That would suggest a single ring or a single double bond. But the IR has two carbonyl groups, which would require two DoU. So option A doesn't fit.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds. If it's a beta-diketone, that's two carbonyl groups (two DoU), and with an O-H group, that fits.

But beta-diketones have the structure R-CO-CH2-CO-R'. So for a six-carbon compound, perhaps a structure like CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3 (that's 6 carbons). But that would be C6H10O2, right? Because each ketone is a O, so two O's. So that would be option C, not B.

Wait, but option B has only one O. So that's a contradiction. So maybe beta-diketone is not option B.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's recap.

Key points:

1. FTIR: broad O-H (likely alcohol or carboxylic acid), two carbonyls (1700 and 1650).

2. 1H NMR: vinyl hydrogens (so double bonds or aromatic rings).

3. Mass spec: fragment at 45, which is CH2CH3O (ethoxy group).

So, let's look at the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. If the compound has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), that would account for the fragment at 45. So maybe the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group and a carbonyl group. But where does the O-H come from? If the ester is an acetate, then the structure would be something like CH3COOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. But that would be a longer chain, not six carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an ethoxy group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted benzyl acetate, but that's again more than six carbons.

Wait, another thought: if the compound has a ketone and an alkoxy group, perhaps the structure is something like methyl cyclohexyl ketone. But that's C7H10O, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a conjugated carbonyl. So, for example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would be longer.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a five-membered ring (gamma-lactone), but that would be C5H8O2. Not matching.

Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Let me think again about the fragment at 45. If the fragment is CH2CH3O (45), then the molecule must have an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). So the formula must include that group. So the formula would have 2 oxygen atoms if it's an ester or ether. So option C (C6H10O2) or option A (C6H12O2).

If the formula is option C, C6H10O2, and there's an OCH2CH3 group, that's two oxygens. So the other oxygen would be in another group. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2O-CO-... But wait, that's getting a bit unclear.

Wait, think about possible structures. Let's consider the possibility that the compound is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters have the structure R-O-CO-CH2-CO-R'. For example, ethyl acetoacetate is a gamma-keto ester, but that's C5H8O3. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is methyl acetoacetate. Wait, that's C4H6O3, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a conjugated carbonyl. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's C6H10O2. Let's check:

Structure: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's a six-carbon ester, with a double bond. So, the IR would have a carbonyl at around 1700, and the double bond (C=C) could be at around 1650. The O-H? Wait, unless there's an alcohol group somewhere else. Wait, no, this structure doesn't have an O-H group. So that would conflict with the FTIR's broad O-H peak.

So that can't be the structure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure has both an ester group and an alcohol group. So a compound like HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a smaller molecule.

Wait, if the structure is something like HOCH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, then that's six carbons (HOCH2COO is four, and the ethyl is two more? Wait, no, that's actually a five-carbon structure). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether with an ester group and an O-H. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of an ethoxy group (fragment at 45) suggests the molecular formula includes an OCH2CH3 group. So, the formula would have two oxygen atoms: one for the OCH2CH3 and another for the carbonyl group (if it's an ester). So, the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C), as that's the only option with two oxygen atoms.

So, putting it all together:

- Two carbonyl groups → two DoU. IR shows 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹.

- An O-H group → broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹.

- Vinyl hydrogens → double bond in the structure.

- Fragment at 45 → ethoxy group (OCH2CH3).

So, the structure must be an ester (with OCH2CH3) and a carbonyl group, along with an O-H group. Hmm, but that would require three oxygens. Wait, no, because the ester is O-CO-O, so that's two oxygen atoms. If there's another O-H, that would make three oxygens, but the options don't have that.

Hmm, so perhaps the structure isn't an ester. Maybe it's an orthoester or something else, but I'm not familiar with that.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto alcohol. So, a structure like HOCH2COCH2COOR. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal with a carbonyl group. But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a ketone with an ethoxy group and an O-H group. But that would require three oxygens, which isn't in any of the options.

Wait, maybe the O-H is part of an alcohol, not an ester. So the structure has a ketone, an ethoxy group, and an O-H. But that would be three oxygens, which again doesn't match the options.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another thought: the molecular formula with two oxygens and twelve hydrogens is option A (C6H12O2). DoU is 1. So maybe that's a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone). But a lactone has a ring, which is a DoU. The carbonyl is another DoU. So that would be two DoU, but formula A has DoU=1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diethyl ketone. Wait, diethyl ketone is (CH2CH3)2CO, which is C5H10O. But the options don't have that.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of what each spectral data tells me.

FTIR:

- Broad O-H → O-H group (alcohol or maybe carboxylic acid).

- 1700 → carbonyl (ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.)

- 1650 → another carbonyl (maybe conjugated) or an aromatic ring.

1H NMR:

- Vinyl H → sp² C-H, so double bond or aromatic.

Mass Spec:

- Fragment at 45 → likely an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3).

So, putting these together, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ketone with an ethoxy group and an O-H group. But that would require three oxygens, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe the compound is a substituted acetophenone with an ethoxy group. But that would be more than six carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the formula C6H10O2 (option C). It has two oxygens. So, perhaps the structure is an ester (which uses two oxygens) plus a double bond.

But then where's the O-H? Because the IR shows a broad peak, which suggests an -OH group. So if it's an ester, it can't have an -OH unless it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a beta-keto ester, where the O-H is from an adjacent alcohol group. Wait, that would give three oxygens, but option C only has two. So that can't be.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should just make an educated guess based on the information.

So, from the IR, two carbonyls suggest two oxygen groups. The O-H suggests another oxygen. But in the options, only option C and A have two oxygens. Wait, no: options C and A have two oxygens. Option C is C6H10O2 (two oxygens), and option A is C6H12O2 (two oxygens). Wait, so option B is C6H10O (one O), and D is C6H12O (one O).

But the FTIR has a broad O-H, so the compound must have at least one O. So options A and C have two O's, which could account for the O-H and a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, the two carbonyls could be from two different groups. For example, a ketone and an ester. So, the ester would contribute two O's. But then if there's an O-H, that would make three O's, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbonyls are a ketone and an aldehyde. But that would require two O's. So, the structure could have a ketone and an aldehyde group, along with an O-H. But that would be three O's, which again isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal with a ketone group. Hemiacetals have two O's. Let's see, for six carbons, perhaps something like cyclohexanone with an O-H and a hemiacetal structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone with a hydroxyl group. For example, a structure with two ketone groups and an -OH. That would require three O's, so no.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let's think about the mass spec fragment again. The fragment is at 45, which is the mass of an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). So, the molecule must have an ethoxy substituent. So, the formula must include OCH2CH3.

So, the molecular formula would be CnH2mOx, where OCH2CH3 is part of it. So, if the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, that's 2 carbons, 6 hydrogens, and 1 O. So, the rest of the molecule would be C(n-2)H(2m-6)O(x-1).

Looking at option C: C6H10O2. Subtracting OCH2CH3 (2C, 6H, 1O), the remaining part is C4H
