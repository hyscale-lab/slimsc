Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving. Oh, right, this must involve some relativity concepts because the medium is moving relative to the observer.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, so the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's speed relative to the lab might be affected by both the glass's motion and the medium's effect on light speed.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Without any motion, the speed of light in the glass would be c/n. But since the glass is moving, do I just add the velocities? Like, in the lab frame, would the light's speed be (c/n) + v? That doesn't sound right because velocities don't just add up in relativity, especially when dealing with light. Oh wait, maybe it's a non-relativistic case? The problem states that v is a constant velocity, so perhaps we're assuming it's non-relativistic.

Wait, but light speed is always c in vacuum according to relativity. Wait, but here the light is in a medium. So in the medium, the speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light?

I remember something about the Doppler effect, but that's more about frequency and wavelength changes. Or maybe it's about adding velocities in a certain way.

Wait, Newtonian addition of velocities would suggest that the speed of the light in the lab frame would be the speed inside the medium plus the medium's speed. So (c/n) + v. But wait, since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, does that mean the light's speed would be (c/n) + v? But wait, if the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, does that make the light's speed relative to the lab faster?

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light shouldn't exceed c, but in this case, if n is greater than 1, c/n is less than c. So adding v, which is a small velocity (I assume v is much smaller than c), so (c/n + v) would still be less than c if v isn't too big. But wait, is that the right approach?

Alternatively, maybe I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the light in the medium's frame, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab.

Wait, but what's u in this case? In the medium's frame, the light's speed is c/n. So u = c/n. Then, the lab frame would see the speed as ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n)*v ) / c² ) ). Let me compute that.

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)). So the speed would be [ (c + n v ) / n ] divided by [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ].

Let me write that out as fractions. The numerator is (c + n v)/n. The denominator is (n c + v)/(n c). So when you divide them, it's (c + n v)/n multiplied by (n c)/(n c + v).

The n's cancel out, so you get (c + n v) * c / (n c + v). Wait, no, let me compute that again. Wait, denominator is (n c + v) in the denominator of the denominator. So:

[ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ] = [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c +v) ) ].

The n's cancel: (c + n v) * c / (n c + v) ) = c (c + n v) / (n c + v ).

Hmm, but wait, the speed of light can't exceed c. Let me see. If n is say, 1.5, and v is a significant fraction of c, would this result be larger than c? Let me plug some numbers. Suppose n=1, v=0.5c.

Then numerator is c*(c + 1.5c)= c*(2.5 c)=2.5 c².

Denominator is (1*c + 0.5c)= 1.5 c.

So 2.5c² /1.5 c = (2.5/1.5) c = (5/3) c ≈ 1.666c. That's more than c, which is impossible because nothing can go faster than light in relativity.

Wait, so that can't be right. So maybe the relativistic approach isn't the way to go here. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to be solved using Galilean transformations, assuming v is very small compared to c, so relativistic effects are negligible. But then, the speed of light in the moving medium would be c/n + v. But that's what I thought earlier.

Wait, but the options don't seem to have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is 1, which would be c, but the light is in a medium, so its speed should be c/n, but in the lab frame, maybe modified by the medium's motion.

Wait, another thought. If the medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, the observer would see the light's speed as (c/n) + v, but this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) (1 + n v)/(n + v)

B)1

C)(1 +n v)/(n -v)

D)(1 -n v)/(n +v)

Wait, none of these seem to directly match (c/n + v). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should write everything in terms of c=1, as the question says. So c is 1, so the speed of light in the medium is 1/n.

So if v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab, then the speed of light in the lab frame would be (1/n) + v, assuming Galilean addition. But that's the same as (1 + n v)/n, which is 1/(n) + v.

Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which is not the same as (1 +n v)/n. So that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, but toward the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So it's possible that the light is moving towards the observer faster than the glass's speed.

Wait, but the light in the medium is moving at 1/n. So in the lab frame, the observer would see the speed as (1/n) + v, if Galilean addition applies.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Another approach: Maybe it's about the refractive index from the lab frame's perspective. When the medium is moving, how does the refractive index change?

I'm not sure about that. I think when the medium is moving, the refractive index can change. But I don't remember the exact formula. Maybe the refractive index in the lab frame is different.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of the relativistic Doppler effect, but that affects frequency, not speed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again. Maybe I can test each option with some known scenario.

For example, when v=0, the speed of light should be 1/n. Let's see:

Option A: (1+0)/(n+0) =1/n. Correct.

Option B: 1. That would imply when v=0, light speed is 1, but in medium it's 1/n. So only correct if n=1. So this can't be the answer.

Option C: (1+0)/(n-0)=1/n. Correct when v=0.

Option D: (1-0)/(n+0)=1/n. Correct when v=0.

So all options except B are correct when v=0. So that doesn't help.

Another scenario: when n=1 (vacuum), what happens?

Assume n=1, so speed of light is 1 in the medium (which it is, since c=1). Now, the glass is moving at velocity v. What would the lab observer see?

If glass is moving towards the observer, and light is moving in same direction as glass, then according to Galilean addition, the speed would be 1 + v. But that's more than c if v is positive, which can't be right. Hmm, but in reality, in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the motion of the source or medium. Wait, but the glass is a medium, and light's speed in a vacuum is always c. So wait, in this case, if the glass is moving, but the light is in a vacuum (n=1), then the speed of light in the lab frame would still be c.

Wait, but according to option B, when n=1, the speed is 1, which is correct regardless of v. So in that scenario, option B gives 1, which is correct. So that's a possible clue.

Wait, but when n=1, and the glass is moving, the speed observed is 1, which is correct. So option B would be correct only in that specific case. But the question is about any n and v.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. The speed of light in the medium is c/n, and the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So in the lab frame, the speed of the light is (c/n) + v. But wait, I thought earlier that when n=1, that would give 1+v, which would be more than c, which is impossible. But in reality, in a vacuum, the speed is always c, so if the medium is moving, the speed should remain c. So perhaps the correct approach is that, in the lab frame, the speed of light is c, regardless of the medium's motion. But that's only true when the medium is a vacuum. Wait, no. Because in
