Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's see, I need to figure out what the allowed decay products are for this boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, not too sure about the details here, but I think the key point is that the boson X interacts with certain fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, when a particle decays, the mass of the particle has to be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. That's the basic rule for allowed decays, right? So, I need to look at the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into and check their combined mass against 6 GeV.

Wait, the boson X is being coupled to fermions. Let's think about the interaction. The term in the Lagrangian looks like it's a Yukawa coupling kind of interaction, where the boson X is coupling to a fermion ψ. The fermion is written as ψ_f, so maybe f is the fermion type. The term is something like λ f f-bar times X. Hmm, but I might be getting the notation wrong. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the term is -λ f f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Maybe it's more like X is coupling to ψ and ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, but perhaps it's better to focus on what particles can X decay into.

So, the possible decay channels are into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because bosons can decay into fermions if they have the right couplings. So for X to decay into a pair like f f-bar, the mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of f.

Now, what fermions are available? The options given have various quarks and leptons. Let's list them:

Option A includes b, s, u, d, tau, e. Option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Option C adds t, which is the top quark. Option D has b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but the X mass is 6 GeV. Let's think about the masses of the fermions.

First, let's list the masses of the known fermions:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (mu): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.777 GeV
- Quarks:
   - Up (u): ~1.5 MeV (so ~0.0015 GeV)
   - Down (d): ~3 MeV (0.003 GeV)
   - Strange (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
   - Charm (c): ~1.25 GeV
   - Bottom (b): ~4.1 GeV
   - Top (t): ~173 GeV

So, for a decay into a pair, the sum of the two masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Wait, no, sum is not the right term. For a decay into two particles, say f and f-bar, the total mass needed is 2*m_f. Because each has mass m_f, so together 2m_f.

So, for each possible fermion, compute 2m_f and see if it's less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's compute 2m_f for each possible fermion:

- e: 2*0.0005 = 0.001 GeV. Yes, way less than 6.
- mu: 2*0.105 = 0.21 GeV. Yes.
- tau: 2*1.777=3.554 GeV. Yes.
- u: 2*0.0015=0.003 GeV. Yes.
- d: 2*0.003=0.006 GeV. Yes.
- s: 2*0.095=0.19 GeV. Yes.
- c: 2*1.25=2.5 GeV. Yes.
- b: 2*4.1=8.2 GeV. Oh, that's more than 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar.
- t: 2*173=346 GeV. Way too big, so no.

Wait, but looking at the options. Option A includes b, which is 8.2 GeV, which is above 6 GeV. So that decay would be impossible.

So which fermions are allowed?

e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Because their 2m_f is <=6 GeV.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check for c. 2*1.25=2.5, which is less than 6. So yes, X can decay into c c-bar.

What about the others? The bottom (b) is 4.1 GeV, so 2m_b is 8.2, which is above 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar.

Looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed. Because 2*m_c is 2.5 <=6, all the others are even lighter.

Wait, but option B has c, which is allowed, and the others which are allowed as well.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

Wait, let me look again at the options.

Option A: includes b, s, u, d, tau, e. So includes b, which is 4.1*2=8.2>6, so this is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all these fermions have 2m_f <=6 GeV. So B is a possible correct option.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, b is not allowed.

Wait, but wait. What about the quarks? Because for a fermion decay, the X must be able to couple to those quarks. Are there any other considerations, like whether the quarks are up-type or down-type, or whether they are charged?

Wait, the boson X couples to the fermions via the term given. Let me think about the structure of the term. The Lagrangian is written as -λ f f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term is something like λ f ψ^dagger (v + X) ψ, where f is a Dirac spinor. Alternatively, maybe it's a Yukawa coupling term. Suppose that the interaction is between X and a fermion ψ, then the term would be something like λ ψ^dagger X ψ, which would mediate the decay X → ψ ψ_bar.

Wait, but the way the Lagrangian is written is a bit confusing. The term is -λ f f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting this. Maybe the term is actually -λ [f][f-bar][ψ(y)][v + X(y)][ψ_f(y)]. But that's not a standard term. Alternatively, perhaps it's like f and f-bar are indices, and ψ and ψ_f are the fermion fields.

Alternatively, perhaps f is a flavor index, meaning the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ of flavor f. So X can decay into ψ and ψ-bar.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about which fermions the boson X can interact with. Because if the interaction term is present, X can only decay into those fermion types that the Lagrangian allows.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should think of this as the X field coupling to a product of fermion fields. Alternatively, perhaps it's a term that looks like λ (v + X) f f-bar ψ ψ_f. Or perhaps the structure is (v + X) times a Yukawa coupling term. Not entirely clear, but perhaps the important point is that the X field can couple to any fermions ψ and ψ_f, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the term is written as (v + X) multiplied by a Yukawa coupling term λ f f-bar ψ(y) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the interaction is between X and the product of ψ and ψ_f. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the specific fermions that the X couples to.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lagrangian is written in such a way that X couples to all fermions, meaning that X can decay into any possible fermion pair where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

But, for this problem, perhaps the key point is that the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair where 2m_f ≤6 GeV is allowed.

So the allowed decay products are all fermions f where m_f ≤3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses:

e: 0.0005 GeV → allowed
mu: 0.105 → allowed
tau: 1.777 → allowed (2*1.777=3.554 <6)
c: 1.25 → 2.5 <6, allowed
b:4.1 → 8.2 >6 → not allowed
t:173 → way too big.

So the possible decay products are e, mu, tau, c, u, d, s.

Wait, u and d are up and down quarks. Their masses are negligible, but they're still allowed. So X can decay into any of these pairs.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau-bar, mu mu-bar, e e-bar. So that's all the allowed options except for bottom.

Option C includes top, which is impossible.

Option D includes bottom, which is not allowed, so it's incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option B is "X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻"

Yes, that's all the allowed decays.

Wait, but what about the strong force? Do I need to consider whether the fermions can be produced via strong interactions? Because for example, quarks can't be produced freely due to confinement, but in this case, X is a boson that decays into quark-antiquark pairs. So, perhaps it's allowed even though quarks are confined, but for the purpose of this question, I think we're just considering the kinematic possibility, not whether the decay is allowed in vacuum or not.

So the answer is option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the possible fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into. The key condition is that the total mass of the decay products must not exceed the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Electron (\( e \)):** \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
2. **Muon (\( \mu \)):** \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
3. **Tau (\( \tau \)):** \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
4. **Up Quark (\( u \)):** \( m_u \approx 0.0015 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u = 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
5. **Down Quark (\( d \)):** \( m_d \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d = 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
6. **Strange Quark (\( s \)):** \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
7. **Charm Quark (\( c \)):** \( m_c \approx 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c = 2.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
8. **Bottom Quark (\( b \)):** \( m_b \approx 4.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 8.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, exceeds \( m_X \)).
9. **Top Quark (\( t \)):** \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, far exceeds \( m_X \)).

Thus, the allowed decays of \( X \) are into the pairs \( e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B:** Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C:** Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
