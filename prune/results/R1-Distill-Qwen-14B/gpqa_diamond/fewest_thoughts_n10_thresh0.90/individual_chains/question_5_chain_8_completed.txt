Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what the question is about. The problem asks for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each represented as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles like the muon, the Pauli matrices are involved. The general form of the angular momentum operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the vector P · n hat, maybe? Wait, or is it the operator along n? Oh, right! The operator for spin along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the Pauli matrices vector (σ) and the direction vector (n), multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

Wait, but the components here are given as P_x, P_y, P_z, each as (ħ/2) times a matrix. So I think the operator P is the same as the spin operator S, which is (ħ/2) σ. So P is the spin operator here.

So the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of the spin operator along n, with eigenvalue +ħ/2. The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it's in the plane where y=0. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no, since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or 180, wait no, actually, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane is when the angle φ is 0 or π. Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the direction can be described by angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the direction vector can be expressed as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since in x-z, maybe φ is zero, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Wait, maybe it's better to represent it as a unit vector with components (n_x, 0, n_z), such that n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

The operator P along n would be P · n, which is P_x n_x + P_z n_z, since the y-component is zero. So the operator is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1.

So the matrix form of this operator would be (ħ/2) times [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So combining, (n_z * σ_z) is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]], and (n_x σ_x) is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]. So adding them together gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So the operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So the matrix is:

[[ (ħ/2) n_z, (ħ/2) n_x ],
 [ (ħ/2) n_x, -(ħ/2) n_z ]]

Wait, but the problem says that n is in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector we're looking for is along that direction. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector equation is P |v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Hmm, so we can write the eigenvalue equation as:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2) gives:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

n_z v1 + n_x v2 = v1
n_x v1 - n_z v2 = v2

So two equations:

1. (n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
2. n_x v1 - (n_z + 1) v2 = 0

Hmm, let's solve this system. Let me write equations as:

Equation 1: (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
Equation 2: n_x v1 - (n_z +1) v2 = 0

We can treat this as a homogeneous system. For a non-trivial solution, the determinant must be zero. But perhaps it's easier to express one variable in terms of another.

From equation 1: (n_z -1) v1 = -n_x v2 → v1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] v2

Wait, but let me check: (n_z -1) v1 = -n_x v2 → v1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] v2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to solve for v1 and v2 ratios.

Assume v2 ≠ 0. Then, equation 1 gives v1 = [ n_x / (1 - n_z) ] v2.

Wait, yes, because (n_z -1) is -(1 - n_z), so moving the terms:

v1 = [n_x/(1 - n_z)] v2.

Now, substitute this into equation 2:

n_x v1 - (n_z + 1) v2 =0 → n_x [n_x/(1 -n_z) v2 ] - (n_z +1) v2 = 0.

Factor out v2:

[ n_x² / (1 -n_z) - (n_z +1) ] v2 =0 → Since v2 is not zero, the bracket must be zero.

So:

n_x² / (1 -n_z) - (n_z +1 ) = 0.

Multiply both sides by (1 -n_z):

n_x² - (n_z +1)(1 -n_z) = 0.

Simplify (n_z +1)(1-n_z) = 1 -n_z^2.

So:

n_x² - (1 - n_z^2 ) =0 → n_x² + n_z^2 =1.

Which is true because n is a unit vector. So that's consistent. So the solution is that v1 is [n_x/(1 -n_z)] v2.

So the ratio v1/v2 = n_x/(1 -n_z).

Let me write this as v1 = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] v2.

Now, to find the eigenvector, I can represent it as a vector (v1, v2) where v1 is proportional to n_x and v2 proportional to (1 -n_z), but wait, let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the eigenvector in terms of angles. Since n lies in the x-z plane, we can define the direction with an angle θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the angle between the direction n and the z-axis.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ into the ratio v1/v2:

v1/v2 = sinθ / (1 - cosθ).

Hmm, using the identity (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So,

v1/v2 = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ) ] = cot(θ/2).

So v1 = cot(θ/2) v2.

Let me choose v2 = sin(θ/2), then v1 = cos(θ/2).

So the eigenvector would be proportional to [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, I should check normalization. The sum of the squares should be 1.

So [ cos(θ/2) ]^2 + [ sin(θ/2) ]^2 = 1. That's correct.

So the eigenvector is ( cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ), up to a normalization factor. But wait, the components might have complex numbers if there's any Y component. But in this case, since n is in x-z, the Y component is zero, so the eigenvector might not have complex terms. But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I have here.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, when the operator is along n, which is in x-z, so the eigenstates would be real, right? Because the operator is Hermitian (it's an observable), so the eigenvectors can be taken as real.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, for the eigenvector, we have v1 = cos(theta/2) and v2 = sin(theta/2).

Wait, but wait, in the P operator along n, the matrix we had was real, so yes, the eigenvectors would be real.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But I'm not sure if the problem states that n is in the x-z plane, so maybe it's parametrized with theta being the polar angle from the z-axis. So the direction vector is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but in x-z, φ is 0, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps.

Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So the direction vector in x-z plane would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since the plane is x-z, phi is zero, so the components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting into the earlier ratio, v1/v2 = sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2).

So v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

If I set v2 = sin(theta/2), then v1 = cos(theta/2), and the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So this would be the eigenvector. Now, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, the options also have other options with hbar factors. Let's look again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

But in our case, the eigenvector is real, as P is a real matrix (since n is in x-z, so no imaginary terms in the operator matrix?), so the eigenvectors are real.

So the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2) and similar terms, but that seems to involve hbar in the components. But wait, eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the components are coefficients, not having units. Because the Pauli matrices are dimensionless. So the eigenvector components shouldn't have ħ. So options A and D have hbar in them, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, option A is (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar), which would imply they are in units of hbar, which is not correct. So the correct option must be C.

Wait, but another thought: the eigenvector is a spin-1/2 state, so it's a two-component vector. The eigenvalue equation is for the spin in direction n, so the state is |+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But in our problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So e^{i phi} is 1. So the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed from its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given in matrix form. The task is to determine the eigenvector components.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Operator Structure**: The operator $\vec{P}$ is proportional to the Pauli matrices, and the eigenvalue equation for the spin operator along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ is:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
   \]
   where $\hat{n}$ is the unit vector in the x-z plane, $\hat{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$.

2. **Matrix Representation**: The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}$ in matrix form is:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation becomes:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   Solving this yields the eigenvector components in the ratio:
   \[
   v_1 = \cos(\theta/2), \quad v_2 = \sin(\theta/2).
   \]

4. **Normalization**: The eigenvector is normalized as:
   \[
   |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
   - **Option B**: Involves complex terms ($e^{i\phi}$), which are unnecessary since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane (no imaginary components in the eigenvector).
   - **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector components $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
   - **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and additional factors, which are inconsistent with the normalized eigenvector.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Answer: C
