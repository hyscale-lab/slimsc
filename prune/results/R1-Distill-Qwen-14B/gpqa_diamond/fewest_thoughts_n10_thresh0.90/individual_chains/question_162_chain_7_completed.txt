Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that metrics relate to the geometry of spacetime or surfaces. So this must be a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy.

Wait, I think a pseudosphere is a type of surface with constant negative curvature. Like, it's like a saddle shape but more symmetric. Oh right, in hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is an example. Its area might have a specific formula, but I'm not sure. Or maybe I should look at the metric given and see what kind of geometry it represents.

The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see, this looks similar to the metric of a sphere, but with a negative curvature. Wait, I remember that for a sphere of radius a, the metric in isometric coordinates can be written as ds² = (a²/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe this is a form of the Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = (4/(1 - x² - y²²)) (dx² + dy²). Wait, in this case, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So maybe this is a scaled version.

If I let r be the radial coordinate, then x² + y² = r². So the denominator is 4(1 - (r²/4)) = 4(1 - (r²/(2²))). So the metric becomes (32)/(4(1 - r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²) or something like that. Wait, no, let's compute that properly.

Wait, let's factor out the 4 from the denominator: 4 - x² - y² = 4 [ 1 - (x² + y²)/4 ] = 4[1 - (r²/4)]. So the metric becomes (32)/(4[1 - (r²/4)]) (dr² + r² dθ²), because dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ² in polar coordinates.

Simplify that: 32/(4(...)) is 8/(1 - (r²/4)). So ds² = (8)/(1 - (r^2/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, comparing to the standard Poincaré disk metric which is ds² = (4/(1 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, but in our case, it's scaled. Because the denominator here is 1 - (r²/4), so maybe the radius of the Poincaré disk is 2, since r^2/4 is (r/2)^2. So if the radius is a, usually in Poincaré disk, a^2 is 1, but here it's 4. So scaling by a factor of 2.

So the radius of curvature in the Poincaré disk is a, and here a² is 4, so a is 2. Oh, that's why the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So this metric is representing a hyperbolic plane (which can be thought of as a pseudosphere in 2D) with radius 2.

Now, the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, a pseudosphere is an infinite surface, so its area might be infinite. But wait, in two dimensions, the area of a hyperbolic disk of radius R is 4π sinh²(R/a), where a is the radius of curvature. Wait, but for a pseudosphere, perhaps it's referring to a finite area? Or maybe not.

Wait, no, pseudosphere in 3D has finite area, but in 2D, a hyperbolic plane is infinite, so any disk on it has infinite area. But wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Poincaré disk model is a conformal map of the hyperbolic plane onto the unit disk, but the area in the model is not the same as the actual hyperbolic area. The area element is given by the determinant of the metric, which in this case is the product of the coefficients of dr² and r² dθ², divided by the square of the old coordinates. Wait, no, the area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. For the metric ds² = E dr² + G r² dθ², the area element is sqrt(EG) dr dθ. 

In our case, E is 8/(1 - r²/4), and G is 8 r²/(1 - r²/4). So the determinant is (8/(1 - r²/4)) * (8 r²/(1 - r²/4)) ) = 64 r² / (1 - r²/4)^2. So the area element dA is sqrt(64 r² / (1 - r²/4)^2 ) dr dθ. That simplifies to 8 r / (1 - r²/4) dr dθ.

Wait, but let me compute that again. The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). In polar coordinates, 4 - r² = 4(1 - r²/4), so 32/(4(1 - r²/4)) = 8/(1 - r²/4). So the metric becomes ds² = (8/(1 - r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So E = 8/(1 - r²/4) and G = 8 r²/(1 - r²/4).

So the determinant of the metric is E * G = (8/(1 - r²/4)) * (8 r²/(1 - r²/4)) )= 64 r²/(1 - r²/4)^2. So the area element is sqrt(EG) dr dθ = sqrt(64 r²/(1 - r²/4)^2) dr dθ. That's 8 r/(1 - r²/4) dr dθ.

So the area is the integral over r from 0 to some maximum value, and θ from 0 to 2π. The maximum r is when 4 - r² approaches zero, so r approaches 2. So the integral is from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to 2π.

So the area is ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [8 r/(1 - r²/4)] dr dθ.

Let's compute the inner integral first: ∫ [8 r/(1 - r²/4)] dr. Let me make a substitution: let u = 1 - r²/4. Then du/dr = (-2r)/4 = (-r)/2. So du = (-r /2) dr. Rearranging, -2 du = r dr. Hmm, wait, the numerator is 8 r dr. So:

∫ [8 r/(1 - r²/4)] dr = 8 ∫ [r / u ] dr.

Substitute u =1 - r²/4 → du = (-r/2) dr → r dr = -2 du.

So 8 ∫ (r dr)/u = 8 ∫ ( (-2 du) ) / u.

Which is 8 * (-2) ∫ (du/u ) = -16 ∫ (du/u ) = -16 ln |u| + C.

But u = 1 - r²/4, so substituting back:

-16 ln(1 - r²/4) + C.

Evaluate from r=0 to r=2.

At r=2: 1 - (4)/4 = 1 - 1 = 0 → ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral becomes -16 [ ln(0) - ln(1) ) ].

But ln(0) is -infinity, so the integral is ∫ from 0 to 2 of [8 r/(1 - r²/4)] dr = -16 [ (ln 0) - 0 ] = -16 [ (-infty) - 0 ] = +infty.

Wait, but this would mean that the area is infinite. So the area is ∫ (over θ) [ ∫ (over r) ... ] dr dθ.

Since the inner integral is infinite, the entire area is infinite. So the area of this pseudosphere is infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

So the answer should be D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This metric represents a 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, specifically the Poincaré disk model scaled to a radius of curvature \(a = 2\). The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) can be rewritten as \(4(1 - r^2/4)\), where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\), indicating that the metric is consistent with a hyperbolic plane of radius 2.

To compute the area, we convert to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(dx^2 + dy^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\). The metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{8}{1 - r^2/4} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in 2D is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta\), where \(\det g = E \cdot G\). Here, \(E = \frac{8}{1 - r^2/4}\) and \(G = \frac{8 r^2}{1 - r^2/4}\), so:

\[
\det g = \frac{64 r^2}{(1 - r^2/4)^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{8 r}{1 - r^2/4} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The area is then computed by integrating \(dA\) over the region \(0 \leq r < 2\) (since the metric breaks down at \(r = 2\)) and \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{8 r}{1 - r^2/4} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The inner integral over \(r\) is evaluated using the substitution \(u = 1 - r^2/4\), leading to:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{8 r}{1 - r^2/4} \, dr = -16 \ln|1 - r^2/4| \Big|_0^2.
\]

At \(r = 2\), \(1 - r^2/4 = 0\), and \(\ln(0) = -\infty\), so the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). Therefore, the total area is infinite.

Since the pseudosphere is an infinite surface in hyperbolic geometry, its area is indeed infinite.
