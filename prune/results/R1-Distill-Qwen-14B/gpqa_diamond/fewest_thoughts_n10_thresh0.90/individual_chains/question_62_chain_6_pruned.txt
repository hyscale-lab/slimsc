Okay, so I have to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I should probably draw the structures to understand what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group, which is like a triple bond attached to another carbon. So, it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the structure is cyclohexane attached to a carbon that's triple bonded to another carbon, which is just a CH group. So maybe it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Not sure, but the point is, it's a sp-hybridized carbon attached to the cyclohexane.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me parse that. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group attached (the aldehyde). The substituent is at position 1, which is the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, attached to the aldehyde carbon (position 1?), we have a CH2 group, which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, something like:

O=CH-(Cyclohexyl)(OH)CH2-Cyclohexane? Or wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon is connected to a CH2 group that has both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane, and the CH2 group is attached to that same carbon, which has a cyclohexyl and an OH group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the target as having two cyclohexane rings. One is the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part, which is the main ring with an aldehyde substituent. The other is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH)CH2- group to the main ring. Or perhaps not. Alternatively, the molecule could have a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group, which is also attached to another cyclohexane. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps that's okay for now.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, I need to convert this into the target. Let me think about the possible reactions.

The target has an aldehyde group, so I probably need to introduce an aldehyde. Also, it has a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group that's connected to another cyclohexane. So perhaps a Grignard reaction, or some kind of oxidation, or maybe a conjugate addition?

Let me think step by step. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with an ethynyl group. The ethynyl group is a good leaving group under certain conditions, maybe. Or perhaps I can perform some kind of alkyne chemistry to add groups.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has the structure cyclohexane-C≡CH. To get to the target, which has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, perhaps I need to perform some kind of oxidation or hydration.

Alternatively, maybe an alkyne can be converted into a ketone or aldehyde. Let me think, if I have a terminal alkyne like ethynylcyclohexane, under certain conditions I can perform oxymercuration or some hydration. Oxymercuration would add a hydroxyl group in a Markovnikov fashion. But wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps that comes from the alkyne being partially hydrogenated or oxidized.

Alternatively, maybe I can add a hydroxyl group to the alkyne. Wait, but the target has more than that. Let me think about the steps.

I think the target has a cyclohexane ring connected via a CH2 group to another cyclohexane, along with a hydroxyl group on that CH2. And then there's an aldehyde group on the main ring. Hmm, maybe the main ring is being oxidized to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a ring with a triple bond. To make an aldehyde, I might need to add an oxygen. Maybe through oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps I can convert the ethynyl group into a ketone or aldehyde.

Another thought: Grignard reagents are used to add alkyl groups. If I can add a methyl group somewhere, that might help.

Let me look at the options to see possible reagents.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd, then Ba(OH)2, then H2SO4 and HgSO4 with H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 and methyl chloride — that's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Like in a Birch reduction? Or perhaps a Grignard-like alkylation. Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methyl chloride would then act as an alkylating agent. Maybe this is a method to alkylate the alkyne. But wait, alkyne alkylation could be done via a Grignard or organometallic.

Wait, after alkylation, perhaps they are hydrogenating the triple bond. Let's see, step 2 is H2 with Pd. So hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond. Then Ba(OH)2 — that's a strong base, maybe for elimination. Then H2SO4 with HgSO4 and H2O — that sounds like a hydration with HgSO4 as a catalyst, like oxymercuration? Or maybe acid-catalyzed hydration.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The target has an aldehyde group. How can I introduce an aldehyde from a triple bond?

Another approach: Maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone, then perhaps reduced or oxidized. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each step in each option.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, then Li in liquid NH3, then O3 and H2O, then NH4OH.

NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would alkylate, perhaps adding an ethyl group. Then Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, maybe for deprotonation or elimination. Ozone followed by work up with NH4OH sounds like ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But we don't have a double bond yet.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd with CaCO3, then O3 with (CH3)2S, then Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, H2/Pd with CaCO3 is hydrogenation — likely reducing a triple bond to a single bond. Ozone with (CH3)2S is reductive workup, so perhaps breaking a double bond into aldehydes or ketones. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe elimination.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li in liq NH3, then O3 with (CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

NaNH2 and methanol — perhaps forming a Grignard-like reagent? Wait, methanol is not a good electrophile for alkylation. Unless it's a deprotonation, but methanol is a poor acid. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group.

I need to get to a compound that has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group, and another cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the process involves adding a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane ring to the ethynyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a secondary alcohol. So, perhaps the steps involve adding an alcohol group, then oxidizing it to an aldehyde. But in the target, the aldehyde is on the main ring, not on the substituent. So that's conflicting.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible steps each option is suggesting.

Option C: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That's probably a deprotonation and alkylation. The alkyne could be deprotonated by NaNH2, then methyl chloride would add a methyl group. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is less acidic than, say, acetylene? Maybe the alkyne proton can be deprotonated. So after adding methyl chloride, perhaps the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-cyclohexane? Or maybe a substitution occurs. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so in the presence of methyl chloride, it would abstract a proton from the alkyne (since the alkyne is acidic, pKa around 25), then methyl chloride would act as an electrophile, so the alkyne would get a methyl group.

Wait, so we start with ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Using NaNH2 and methyl chloride would deprotonate the alkyne and add a methyl group. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3? Or wait, the alkyne is between two cyclohexane rings? No, I think the structure is cyclohexane connected to a CH2-C≡CH. So, if we deprotonate the alkyne and add a methyl group, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3. So the product after step 1 would be methylcyclohexy acetylene? So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne? Wait, I'm not sure.

Then step 2: H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate. That's hydrogenation. So the triple bond becomes a single bond. So cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, no. If the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH3 connected to cyclohexane, then hydrogenation would convert it to CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond would make it into a single bond. So CH2-C-CH2-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or wait, the triple bond is between the two CH2 groups, so hydrogenation would add two H's across each bond, turning the triple bond into a single bond. So it would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 connected to the cyclohexane. So the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So that's butylcyclohexane? Or maybe more accurately, the product is 1-cyclohexylethylpropane or something like that. Hmm, not sure.

Then step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds. But in this case, after step 2, we have a single bond. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial structure after step 1 is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Step 2 is hydrogenation with H2 and Pd. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So that's a straight chain, no double bonds. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything because there's no double bond. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the steps. Let me think again. Alternative approach: Maybe the initial alkyne is converted into a diene, which would then undergo ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diene via some reaction. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a double bond, then worked up with ozone. Wait, but step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a hydrogenation catalyst, so that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, not a double bond. So that can't be how.

Hmm, maybe I should think of each option's steps.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol as a methylating agent? But methanol is a poor electrophile. Maybe the reaction is deprotonation to form an alkyne anion, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol would act as an acid, not as an electrophile. Wait, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by some reaction, but I'm not sure what.

Step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used for elimination or deprotonation, like in the Birch reduction or for forming alkenes via elimination.

Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. Again, ozonolysis.

Step 4 is NH4OH. Which is a workup, maybe acid workup.

But I'm not seeing how this would form the target molecule.

Let me think about the desired product again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group connected to another cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the main ring has an aldehyde, and the substituent is a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone. How? Maybe through hydration. If we add water to the triple bond, we could get a ketone. Wait, but under oxymercuration, the triple bond would add water in a certain way.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane could be hydrated to cyclohexylacetaldehyde. Wait, no, hydration of an alkyne gives a ketone. Oh wait, hydration of ethynylcyclohexane would give a ketone. So, if I have cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH, and I add HgSO4 and H2SO4, I would get cyclohexane-CH2-CO-H. Which is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Oh! So, perhaps the first step is to hydrate the triple bond to form the aldehyde.

But looking at the options, let me see which option has that kind of step.

Looking at option A: step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a base. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. So perhaps that's a hydration step.

Wait, step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the typical conditions for oxymercuration, but usually, that's for alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps it's acid-catalyzed hydration of a triple bond to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but when a terminal alkyne is treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water, it undergoes hydration to form a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane-CH2-CO-H, which is the aldehyde we need. But wait, that would be cyclohexylacetaldehyde. Let me think: the starting structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Hydration would add an -OH across the triple bond, but for a terminal alkyne, it would form a ketone, but in this case, the alkyne is attached to a cyclohexane, so perhaps the product is cyclohexane-CH2-CO-H, which is an aldehyde? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Hydration of a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH) would form R-C≡C-Hg-OH, then under acid conditions, it becomes R-CO-OH, which is a carboxylic acid. Wait, but that's not an aldehyde. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no: the hydration of a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH) typically gives a ketone if it's a cyclic structure. Wait, no. Let me correct that. Hydration of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O gives a ketone (R-CO-CH2-OH?), no, wait. Actually, the hydration of a terminal alkyne under acidic conditions gives a ketone. Wait, no: the terminal alkyne (like ethyne) would form acetaldehyde upon hydration. So, R-C≡CH + HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O → R-CHO.

Oh, so in this case, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexylacetaldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde), which is exactly the aldehyde group in the target molecule. So, that step would give me the aldehyde.

But then, how do I get the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group attached?

Wait, the target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group, and another substituent. So, perhaps I'm adding a substituent to the aldehyde carbon after forming the aldehyde. Hmm, but that's not possible directly because the aldehyde is R-CHO. To add a substituent to the aldehyde carbon, you usually have to form an enolate and then quench it, but that's more advanced.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is modified before the hydration. Let me think about the steps.

If I have ethynylcyclohexane and I want to add a hydroxymethyl group and another cyclohexane, perhaps I can perform some kind of alkylation followed by hydrogenation and then hydration.

Wait, looking at option C: step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, deprotonating the alkyne and adding a methyl group. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, forming a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave double bonds, but after hydrogenation, there are no double bonds. So that can't be right. So perhaps option C isn't the right choice.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. I'm not sure what that does. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or to form a Grignard-like reagent, but methanol isn't a good electrophile. Maybe this step doesn't do anything. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which could be for deprotonation or elimination. Maybe it's for forming a strong base. Then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is ozonolysis with a reductive workup. Then step 4 is NH4OH. Not sure how this would build the target.

Option B: Step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, alkylating the alkyne with ethyl chloride. Then step 2 is Li in liq NH3. That could be for elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. Then step 3 is O3 and H2O. Ozonolysis on the double bond would break it into carbonyl groups. Then step 4 is NH4OH. So, putting it all together: alkylate the alkyne, form a double bond, then cleave it with ozone to make carbonyls.

But the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene, which is then ozonolyzed to form two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think in another way. Perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone or aldehyde, and then a Grignard reaction is used to add another group.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexane ring and another cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first alkylated to add a methyl group, then the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, and then some oxidation or addition occurs.

Alternative approach: Let me think about the target structure. It has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So, the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane. The substituent is a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, the main structure is cyclohexane with a CH2 group that has a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. Hmm.

So, to get that substituent, perhaps I need to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group onto a CH2 group attached to the main ring.

Wait, maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a Grignard reagent, then quenched with something that adds a hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, then undergoes some elimination.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think step by step:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → something → target.

The target has an aldehyde and a substituent with a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a double bond, then undergoes some addition.

Wait, another approach: The target has a structure where the aldehyde is on the main ring, and attached to that ring is a CH2 group bearing a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the aldehyde comes from the triple bond being hydrated (step 4 in option A?), and the substituent comes from another part.

Wait, but the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH)CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is first alkylated to become a longer chain, then hydrogenated, then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another angle.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis with a reductive workup (like Zn in presence of something), which would break a double bond into aldehydes/ketones. But after step 2 in option C, which is H2/Pd, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond. So, no double bonds to ozonolyze. So option C's step 3 wouldn't do anything. So option C is likely incorrect.

Option A: step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the hydration of the alkyne to a ketone, but in this case, the alkyne is attached to the cyclohexane. So, that would form a cyclohexylacetaldehyde. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. If we have cyclohexylacetaldehyde, and then treat it with Ba(OH)2, perhaps it would form a Grignard-like reaction. Or maybe it's a base-induced elimination.

Wait, but cyclohexylacetaldehyde has the structure cyclohexane-CH2-CHO. If Ba(OH)2 is added, perhaps it deprotonates the alpha carbon (the CH2 group), leading to some elimination. But where would the elimination happen? The aldehyde is on the end, so perhaps it wouldn't eliminate. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for something else, like hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 step is for epoxide formation, but I don't see how.

Option A's step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, deprotonate the alkyne and add methyl chloride. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2: perhaps elimination to form a double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me with elimination of water? But where's the water? Maybe Ba(OH)2 is causing some kind of elimination, but I'm not sure. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: hydration of the triple bond? But the triple bond was already hydrogenated.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the correct reagents for each step.

The target has two rings and an aldehyde. So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via hydration of the alkyne, and the substituent is added via a Grignard reaction.

Wait, but Grignard would add to a carbonyl. So, perhaps the aldehyde is first formed, then a Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group. How would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a vinyl group, which is then used in a conjugate addition.

Wait, another thought: The target has a structure where a cyclohexyl group is attached to a CH2 group that also has a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol, then a Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a gem-diol, then oxidized to form a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl or ethyl group.

2. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form aldehydes or ketones.

But I'm not seeing how that would form the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then subjected to a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the aldehyde is on the main ring, so perhaps the Grignard adds to the aldehyde.

Hmm.

Alternatively, the correct reagents for forming the hydroxymethyl group would involve adding a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about what each reagent does in the options.

Looking at option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe that's a deprotonation followed by some reaction, but not sure.

Step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps used for elimination or deprotonation.

Step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup. So, any double bonds would be cleaved into carbonyls.

Step 4 is NH4OH, which is a weak acid, perhaps for workup.

But I don't see how this would build the substituent.

Option B: step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, so adding ethyl group to alkyne. Step 2 is Li in liq NH3, which could be for elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. So, ethylated alkyne becomes a longer chain, then elimination to form a double bond. Then step
