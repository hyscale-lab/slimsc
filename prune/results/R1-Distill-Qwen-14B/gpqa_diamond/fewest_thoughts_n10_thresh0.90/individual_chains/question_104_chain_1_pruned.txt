Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is, the bigger the shift, right?

The question says that two stars have the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the main differences are the shifts in their spectral lines: 5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 for #2. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I recall is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the shift. So if planet #1 causes a 5 mA shift and #2 causes 7, then their velocities K are in the ratio 5:7? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, because the bigger the velocity, the bigger the shift. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. But wait, no, I think the velocity semi-amplitude K is calculated from the Doppler shift. So if the star moves faster, the spectral line shifts more. So a 7 mA shift implies a higher velocity for planet #2's star.

But what's the relation between the velocity and the orbital parameters? Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_p/M_*))) )

Wait, but since the planet masses are similar to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1, and e is zero because orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version. I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) and something else... Oh wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the planet's orbital period and velocity are related through Kepler's laws. Since the stars are the same, and the planets have similar masses, the main factor here is the velocity of the star's orbit, which relates to the planet's orbital period.

Wait, the formula for K is K = (v) of the star's orbit, which is related to the planet's orbital velocity. Maybe I should think in terms of the mass function and Kepler's third law.

Alternatively, I think the velocity semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and sin i ≈1 because the orbits are probably edge-on. So K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So if K is proportional to M_p / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ), and since M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, no, wait. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K is higher, P is shorter. Because if K increases, the denominator P^(1/3) must decrease, so P must decrease.

So for planet #1, K1 is 5, and for #2, K2 is 7. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But according to the formula, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so P ∝ 1/K.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3.

Wait, let me think again. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/K. Specifically, P ∝ 1/K.

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, let me re-derive it.

From the formula, K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). So K1 = (some constant) * (1/P1)^(1/3), K2 = (same constant) * (1/P2)^(1/3).

Dividing both sides: K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (K1/K2
