Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spins and partition functions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my statistical mechanics, but let's see if I can figure this out step by step. 

The question says we have three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, each with different expressions involving exponential terms.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), but I think the exact expression might get simplified in terms of J and beta.

So, first, I need to figure out all possible states of the system. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. Oh wait, that's right. Each spin has two possibilities, so 2*2*2 = 8 states.

But calculating the energy for each state and then the exponentials for each might be tedious, but manageable since it's only 8 states. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to group the states by their energies, so we don't have to compute each individually.

Let me think about the energy expression: E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). Each term S_i S_j can be +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are aligned or anti-aligned. So, each product S_i S_j is 1 if the spins are the same, -1 otherwise.

So, for each pair, S1S2, S1S3, S2S3, the possible values are either +1 or -1. The sum of these three terms can vary, so the total energy depends on the number of +1 and -1 in that sum.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of aligned pairs. Let me denote:

Each S_i S_j term is +1 if aligned, -1 otherwise. So, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be calculated based on how many pairs are aligned.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of each possible configuration and calculate the energy.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3), each being +1 or -1. Let me list all 8 possible states and compute the energy for each.

1. (1, 1, 1)
   S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -J *3
2. (1,1,-1)
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E= -J*(-1)= J.
3. (1,-1,1)
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.
4. (1,-1,-1)
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.
5. (-1,1,1)
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 +1 +1 = 1. E= -J*(1) = -J.
6. (-1,1,-1)
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 -1 -1 =-3. E= -J*(-3) =3J.
7. (-1,-1,1)
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3= -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 =-1. E= J.
8. (-1,-1,-1)
   S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E= -J*3.

Wait, let me verify each state's energy.

For state 1: all spins +1. Each pair is aligned, so each S_i S_j is 1. Sum is 3. E=-3J.

State 2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E= J.

Similarly, state 3: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

State 4: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

Wait, that's correct.

State 5: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

Wait, no. E is -J times the sum. So sum is -1, so E is -J*(-1) = J.

Hmm, I think earlier I might have made a mistake in state 5. Let me recalculate.

Wait state 5: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1.

S1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1.

S1S3 = (-1)(1) = -1.

S2S3 = (1)(1) = 1.

Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

So E is -J * (-1) = J. So earlier calculations were correct.

State 6: all spins -1. Each pair is aligned, so sum is 3. E= -3J.

State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.

S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1.

S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

S2S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = J.

State 8: all spins -1. Sum is 3. E=-3J.

Wait, wait, state 6 is (-1, -1, -1), which is same as (1,1,1) but all -1. Sum is 3, so E is -3J.

Wait, so after evaluating all 8 states, their energies are:

- State 1: E = -3J

- State 2: E = J

- State 3: E = J

- State 4: E = J

- State 5: E = J

- State 6: E = -3J

- State 7: E = J

- State 8: E = -3J

Wait, wait, that can’t be. Let me check state 6 again. State 6 is (-1, -1, -1). Each S_i S_j is ( (-1)(-1) )=1 for all three pairs. So sum is 3, E= -J *3 → E= -3J.

Wait, so states 1, 6, and 8 have E= -3J, each contributing a term of exp(beta * 3J) ?

Wait no: since E is negative, exp(-beta E) = exp(3 beta
