Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we have to find out the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, we need to determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D with different pH values and volumes.

Hmm, first, I think I should figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we have and what it converts into when dissolved in acid. Fe(OH)3 is an insoluble hydroxide, so adding an acid should help dissolve it by reacting.

The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl, it'll donate H+ ions. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

Okay, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17=55.85+51=106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol (let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85... yeah, approximately 0.000936 moles.)

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 needs 3 moles of H+, the required moles of H+ are 0.000936 * 3 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration. So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, wait a second, that seems a bit low. Let me think again.

Wait, the total solution volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L. So the acid is part of this 100 cm³. So when I add the acid, the total volume becomes 100 cm³, which might affect the concentration. Hmm, but in the calculation, I just needed to find the volume of the acid solution that provides the required moles of H+.

Wait, maybe I'm correct because the acid's volume is added to the 100 cm³, but in the problem statement, the 100 cm³ is the total volume after dissolving. Hmm, no, the problem says "in 100 cm³ total volume." So perhaps the acid is added to the solution, and the total volume becomes 100 cm³. Or maybe the 100 cm³ is the solvent, and we're adding the acid to it. Wait, the question says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution's final volume is 100 cm³. So when you add Fe(OH)3, you add it to a solution that will end up being 100 cm³. So the acid is part of this 100 cm³.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum volume of the 0.1 M acid needed. So the acid is being added to the solution, and the total volume is 100 cm³. So the acid's volume plus the solution's volume (after dissolving the Fe(OH)3) equals 100 cm³? Or is the 100 cm³ the total, including the acid? Hmm, perhaps I should assume that the acid is added to a solution that's made up to 100 cm³. So the acid contributes to the total volume.

But for the calculation of the acid needed, perhaps I can proceed as before, because the acid is monobasic and strong, so the H+ concentration comes from the acid. So the minimum volume of acid is to provide enough H+ to react with all Fe(OH)3.

So, from earlier calculation, the required H+ is 0.002808 mol. The acid is 0.1 M, so volume = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. So looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. So volume-wise, it's probably option C.

But wait, let me double-check the molar masses. Fe is 55.85, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + (3*(17)) = 55.85 +51=106.85. Correct.

Moles = 0.1 /106.85 ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Then H+ needed is 3 * that, which is 0.0028074 mol. Divide by 0.1 M acid: 0.028074 L, which is 28.074 cm³. So about 28.05 cm³. So option C has 28.05 cm³.

Now, what about the pH? After adding the acid, the solution contains Fe³+ ions. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but in excess acid, it should dissolve completely, forming Fe³+ which is a Lewis acid. Fe³+ tends to hydrolyze in water.

So the solution will have Fe³+ ions from the dissolution. The pH will depend on the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

First, let's find the concentration of Fe³+ in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). The moles of Fe³+ are the same as the moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.0009358 mol. So concentration is 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M.

Fe³+ ions hydrolyze in water: Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. The hydrolysis produces H+ ions, making the solution acidic. We can model this using the hydrolysis constant.

The hydrolysis constant K for Fe³+ is around 1.1 × 10^-31 (I remember this from my notes). Wait, wait, that's the K for Fe³+ hydrolysis: Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. So K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+]

But since K is very small, the hydrolysis is not extensive, so we can approximate.

Let me set up the equation. Let x be the concentration of H+ produced per mole of Fe³+.

At equilibrium:

[Fe³+] = 0.009358 – x ≈ 0.009358 (since x is very small compared to 0.009358).

[H+] = 3x (since each Fe³+ produces 3 H+).

But wait, wait, no. Wait, the reaction produces 3 H+ per Fe³+. So for each mole of Fe³+ that reacts, 3 moles of H+ are produced.

So the initial concentration is [Fe³+] = 0.009358 M.

Change: Fe³+ decreases by x, H+ increases by 3x.

So [Fe³+] ≈ 0.009358 - x ≈ 0.009358.

[H+] = 3x.

So K = ( (x) * (3x)^3 ) / (0.009358 )

Wait, no, because Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so its concentration is effectively constant and doesn't appear in the K expression. Wait, no, in solution, Fe(OH)3 is a precipitate. Or wait, in solution, if it's dissolved, maybe not. Wait, in this case, after adding the acid, Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, so the solution contains Fe³+ ions. So the hydrolysis is Fe³+ (aq) + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3 H+ (aq).

So the K expression is K = ([H+]^3) / [Fe³+].

Because Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is 1 and doesn't appear in the K expression.

So K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+].

We know K is 1.1e-31.

So [H+]^3 = K * [Fe³+]

[Fe³+] is 0.009358 M.

So [H+]^3 = (1.1e-31) * 0.009358 ≈ 1.029e-33.

Taking cube root: [H+] ≈ (1.029e-33)^(1/3) ≈ 2.18e-11 M.

pH = -log10(2.18e-11) ≈ 10.66.

Wait, that's a pH around 10.66, which is basic, but that's impossible because we added a strong acid, so the solution should be acidic. What did I do wrong here?

Oh wait a second, perhaps I confused the reaction. Let me think again: Fe(OH)3 is a base, but when it's dissolved in acid, we have Fe^3+ in solution. Fe^3+ is a strong enough Lewis acid that it can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

Wait, but I just calculated a pH of ~10.66, which is basic. That doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake in the K value or the setup.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ produces H+, so the solution becomes acidic, so the pH should be less than 7.

So perhaps I should reevaluate the K value. Let me check: for Fe^3+ hydrolysis, the K is often given as around 1e-31, which is correct. But wait, wait, maybe I should use the hydrolysis constant in a different way.

Wait, no, the calculation seems correct. But why is the pH basic? That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the reaction. Let me think again: Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but Fe^3+ is a weak acid. So when Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in strong acid, it's converted to Fe^3+ and water. The Fe^3+ then undergoes hydrolysis: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. So this produces H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So the pH should be acidic. So why in my calculation did I get a pH of ~10.66, which is basic? That must mean I did a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, perhaps I confused the K expression. Let me write it again.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

So the expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]. But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's excluded from the expression, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

So, K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

So [H+]^3 = K * [Fe^3+].

So [H+] = (K * [Fe^3+])^(1/3).

Plugging in the numbers:

K = 1.1e-31, [Fe^3+] = 0.009358 M.

So [H+]^3 = 1.1e-31 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.029e-33.

[H+] = cube root of 1.029e-33 ≈ 2.18e-11 M.

pH = -log(2.18e-11) ≈ 10.66.

That can't be right. The solution should be acidic. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong K. Maybe the K is for the reverse reaction. Let me think again. Wait, if Fe(OH)3 is a base, the reaction as written would produce H+ ions. So the K for this reaction would be small, meaning that the production of H+ is not favored, leading to a low concentration of H+.

Wait, but that would make the pH high, which is basic. But that's not possible because we have excess H+ from the strong acid.

Wait, no, perhaps the presence of excess H+ from the strong acid affects the hydrolysis equilibrium.

Ah, right! The solution is acidic because of the added strong acid (H+). So the hydrolysis reaction of Fe^3+ is suppressed by the common ion effect. But wait, the Fe^3+ hydrolysis produces H+, which is in high concentration due to the strong acid. So the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ may not contribute much to the H+ concentration, but the pH is still determined by the strong acid.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you add a strong acid, the H+ concentration is primarily from the acid, not the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but wait, in the calculation earlier, when we added 28.05 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl, let's calculate the moles of H+ added.

Moles of H+ from acid: 0.02805 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.002805 mol.

Moles of H+ from Fe(OH)3 dissolution: Each mole of Fe(OH)3 gives 3 moles of H+. So 0.0009358 mol Fe(OH)3 gives 0.0028074 mol H+.

So total H+ from both sources is about 0.002805 + 0.0028074 ≈ 0.0056124 mol.

But wait, wait, the Fe(OH)3 is being dissolved by the acid, so the H+ from the acid reacts with Fe(OH)3.

So the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So moles of H+ needed for full dissolution: 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.0028074 mol.

The acid provides 0.002805 mol of H+. So it's just barely enough to dissolve all Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but wait, the actual moles of acid needed are 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 28.074 cm³, which is exactly what I calculated earlier.

So after dissolving, the solution contains Fe^3+ and excess H+ (from the strong acid). So the H+ concentration comes from both the strong acid and the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But wait, in reality, the strong acid provides a large amount of H+, so the contribution from Fe^3+ hydrolysis is negligible. So the pH is determined by the strong acid.

Wait, but let's calculate the H+ concentration from both sources.

Moles of H+ from acid: 0.002805 mol.

Moles of H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis: Let's say it's x. But since K is very small, x is tiny compared to 0.002805, so we can ignore it.

So total H+ ≈ 0.002805 mol in 0.1 L:

[H+] = 0.002805 mol / 0.1 L = 0.02805 M.

pH = -log(0.02805) ≈ 1.55.

Wait, that's around 1.55, which isn't among the options. The options have pH values around 2-5.

Hmm, this suggests I'm missing something. Maybe I'm not considering that some H+ remains after the reaction.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.0009358 mol.

Moles of H+ from acid: 0.002805 mol.

So moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009358 = 0.0028074 mol.

The acid provides 0.002805 mol, which is just a bit less than needed. Wait, but that can't be right; you can't dissolve all the Fe(OH)3 if you don't provide enough H+.

Ah, wait, no! The problem is asking for the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So we need to have at least 0.0028074 mol of H+.

So the acid must provide at least 0.0028074 mol of H+. The acid is 0.1 M, so the minimum volume is 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 0.028074 L = 28.074 cm³, which is approximately 28.05 cm³ as in option C.

But then, after adding that volume, all Fe(OH)3 has dissolved. Now, the solution contains Fe^3+ and any excess H+.

Wait, but in this case, the acid provides exactly 0.002805 mol, which is very close to the required 0.0028074 mol. So the H+ from the acid is 0.002805 mol. The reaction consumes 0.0028074 mol H+, so there's a slight deficit. That can't be; you can't have a deficit because you can't dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. So the volume must be enough to provide the required H+. That suggests that option C's volume is just enough, but perhaps you need a little more. But the question asks for the minimum, so perhaps 28.05 cm³ is correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the actual calculation allows for some buffer solution. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the H+ comes from both the acid and the Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But let's think again about the H+ concentration.

After adding 28.05 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl, the moles of H+ from HCl is 0.002805 mol.

The reaction needs 0.0028074 mol H+ to dissolve Fe(OH)3, which is a very small excess. So perhaps the H+ from HCl is just enough, and the solution will have some Fe^3+ and perhaps some excess H+
