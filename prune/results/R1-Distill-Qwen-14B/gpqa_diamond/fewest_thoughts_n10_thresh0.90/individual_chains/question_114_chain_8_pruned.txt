Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let's break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and something else (A) to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and another reagent (B) in water to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different A and B choices.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with CN- (like in NaCN), it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism for that usually involves the ketone attacking the cyanide ion, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the product in the first reaction makes sense—it's a cyanohydrin because we've added a hydroxyl and a nitrile group to the same carbon.

Wait, in the formation of cyanohydrins, the ketone reacts with a cyanide source, but I think the reaction conditions often require an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide is a weak nucleophile, so adding an acid would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. So in the first step, A is probably H3O+ (acid). Looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ as A, while C and D use NaHSO3. So maybe C and D are out for A unless there's another reason.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile with a benzylphenyl group attached. It's reacting with B in water to form a butanoic acid derivative. So the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? Typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, with something like HCl, the nitrile goes through hydrolysis. Maybe using H2O with HCl as a catalyst. So the reagent B should be an acid, perhaps HCl.

Wait, another thought—could it be using a strong oxidizing agent? No, I think the process is hydrolysis. The nitrile group (RCN) on hydrolysis with acid gives a carboxylic acid (RCOOH). So the conditions are probably an acidic aqueous solution.

Looking at the options again. For the second reaction, B is either HCl (option A and C), CH3COOH (options B and D), or something else.

Wait, but the product is a butanoic acid. Let me think about the reaction steps. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a secondary alcohol and a nitrile on the same carbon. When the nitrile is hydrolyzed, it should become a carboxylic acid. So the reaction conditions must be acidic hydrolysis.

In acidic hydrolysis, the nitrile would typically be treated with HCl (like
