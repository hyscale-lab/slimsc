Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Then I have to choose between options A to D for what A and B are.

Hmm. So I think this involves some kind of nucleophilic addition or substitution. Let me think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? It's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile source like NaCN, what typically happens?

Wait, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, they form cyanohydrins. Cyanohydrin formation is a reaction where a nitrile group is added to the carbonyl carbon. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. But how is that done?

The cyanohydrin formation usually involves a base, maybe something like NaOH or a sulfite. Wait, but wait—sulfur-based reagents are sometimes used. Oh right, I think the reaction is done in a solution that provides the cyanide ion and possibly a proton source. Or wait, no. Let me think again. 

In the presence of an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A), maybe the NaCN provides CN- and the acid helps in the protonation steps. Wait, but wait—the mechanism for cyanohydrin formation typically involves the base deprotonating the nitrile after addition. Or wait, perhaps I'm confusing with the aldol reaction. Maybe in the case of ketones, the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then a proton source is needed. Or perhaps, it's done in a basic solution. Wait, but in the presence of an acid, maybe the mechanism is different.

Wait, another approach: when you have a ketone and you add a cyanide source, like NaCN, under certain conditions, you form the cyanohydrin. The conditions might involve an acid catalyst. For example, adding H3O+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, and then the proton from the acid would help in the elimination of water, but wait, wait. No, in this case, since it's a ketone, perhaps the reaction forms a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So starting from butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would add a CN group to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, if it's butan
