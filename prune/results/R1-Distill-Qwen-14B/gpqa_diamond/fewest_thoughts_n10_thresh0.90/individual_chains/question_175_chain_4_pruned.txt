Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with its symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. The problem is asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle, which is given as a function f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A, and we need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of f.

Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since this is a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis, I think the radiation would be dipole-like, maybe like a dipole antenna.

Wait, right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has a specific form. The radiation intensity, which relates to the power per unit solid angle, should peak along the axis of the dipole and fall off as you move away from that direction. The formula I'm trying to recall is for the intensity of dipole radiation.

I think the formula for the intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is something like proportional to (sinθ)^2, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Oh wait, more precisely, I think it's (sin²θ)/something. Let me think. The dipole radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90 degrees, right? Because the dipole's field is strongest perpendicular to its axis. Wait no, wait. No, the radiation for a dipole is maximum at θ=90 degrees? Or is it maximum at the ends, θ=0 and 180? Wait, no, the dipole's electric field has maximums along the axis (θ=0 and 180), but the radiation pattern for intensity involves the square of the sine, so I think the radiation is maximum at θ=90 degrees. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the radiation intensity for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So when θ is 0 (along the dipole axis), sinθ is zero, so the intensity is zero. At θ=90 degrees, sinθ is 1, so the maximum intensity. So that means the maximum intensity is when θ=90 degrees. Oh, so the intensity pattern is a cosine squared function? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is I think (sinθ)^2. So maximum at θ=90. So the total power is the integral over all solid angles of the intensity. So the total power A is the integral of f(λ, θ) dΩ. But wait, the question says the maximum power is A, so perhaps A is the maximum value of f, or the integral of f over solid angle is A? Hmm, the wording says, "the maximum power thus radiated is A." So A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle.

Wait no, the maximum power per unit solid angle is A. So, the function f(λ,θ) is the power per unit solid angle, and its maximum value is A. So, for each direction, the power per unit solid angle is some fraction of A.

Wait, but then the question is, what's the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees? So, if the maximum is A, then the value of f at θ=30 is some fraction of A. So I need to find f(λ,30)/A.

But wait, if the maximum of f is A, then f(θ=90 degrees) = A. Because the maximum for the dipole is at θ=90. So when θ is 30 degrees, what's the value of (sinθ)^2? Let's compute that.

Sin(30 degrees) is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So (sinθ)^2 is 0.25. That would imply that the intensity at θ=30 degrees is 0.25 times the maximum intensity (since maximum is at θ=90, which is 1). So f(30)/A = (sin30)^2 = 0.25. So the fraction is 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4. Now, looking at the options, that's option B or C. Let's check the other part.

The other part is the functional form of f. The function f is the power per unit solid angle, which depends on λ. For dipole radiation, I think the radiated power is proportional to 1/λ^4. Wait, what's the dependence of
