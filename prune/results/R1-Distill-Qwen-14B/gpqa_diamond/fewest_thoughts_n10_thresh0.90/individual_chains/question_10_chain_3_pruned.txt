Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking which one has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d. Each option describes a planet with different mass and radius or composition.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Oh right, the formula is density = mass/volume. Volume is a function of the radius, since volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, bigger radius leads to larger volume, which affects density.

Let me break down each option.

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So if it's Earth's mass and radius, then its density would be the same as Earth's. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So a) has a density of 5.5.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait, wait. The user says the density is 5.5 g/cm³, which is same as Earth. But wait, the mass is 2 Earth masses. How does that relate? Because density is mass divided by volume. So if mass is 2 Earth masses, but the density is same as Earth, then volume must be double. Because density = mass/volume => volume = mass/density. So if mass is 2M, and density same, volume is 2V. So radius would be larger, since volume depends on radius cubed. But regardless, the density is given as 5.5, so this planet's density is 5.5. So same as a.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in the options, for b) the density is given. So regardless of the mass, the density is 5.5. So option b's density is 5.5.

Option c) A planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density, right? Because composition determines density. So if it's same as Earth's composition, its density is same as Earth's, 5.5. But wait, the mass is 5 times Earth. So density is 5.5. So same as a and b.

Option d) Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. Again, same composition, so same density, 5.5. Hmm, but wait,
