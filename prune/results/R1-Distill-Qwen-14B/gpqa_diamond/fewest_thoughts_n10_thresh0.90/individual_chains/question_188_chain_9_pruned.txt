Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about calculating the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, wait. I think the interplanar distance formula for a cubic crystal is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter and hkl are the Miller indices. But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal, not cubic. So the formula must be different. Oh right, for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula involves the angles between the lattice vectors.

The formula I remember is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) ) ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral crystal, all the angles are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma. So that simplifies the formula. Let me write that down.

Given that alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, and a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms. For a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter a would be the same as the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, if it's a primitive lattice, maybe the unit cell is different. Or perhaps in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 'a'?

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be 'a' for nearest neighbors. But in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is connected to others with the same lattice vectors. So I think the a here is the same as the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1. I'll plug those into the formula.

So the denominator inside the square root becomes:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then subtract 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha). Since all angles are 30 degrees, cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute each term:

hk = 1*1 = 1. So 2*1*(0.8660) = 1.732.

Similarly for hl and kl: all the same, each term is 1*1. So each of the three terms is 1.732.

So adding them: 1.732 + 1.732 + 1.732 = 5.196.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 5.196) ? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the formula is (h² +k² +l²) minus 2*(the sum of the products...). So 3 - 5.196 equals negative 2.196. Oh wait, that can't be right because the square root of a negative number isn't real. That must mean I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cos gamma - 2 h l cos beta - 2 k l cos alpha )

Wait, but in this case, all the angles are gamma, beta, alpha, all 30 degrees. So we have:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ), where theta is 30 degrees.

So for h=1, k=1, l=1:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

Then 2(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1 +1 +1) ) = 6.

So 6 * cos(30) = 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. Oh wait, that can't be right because the square root of a negative number is imaginary, which doesn't make sense for a real crystal.

Wait, that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula. Hmm. Maybe I have the signs wrong. Let me double-check the formula.

Oh, wait, perhaps the formula uses cos(180 - theta) somewhere? Or maybe I have the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the angle in the rhombohedral system is measured differently.

Wait, another thought: in the rhombohedral system, the angles are the angles between the lattice vectors. For a rhombohedral system, the three vectors a, b, c all have the same length, a. The angles between a and b is alpha, between b and c is beta, and between a and c is gamma. But wait, no, the three vectors a, b, c are not necessarily all equal in magnitude, unless it's a cubic system. Oh wait, no, in rhombohedral, the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, and the angles are all equal as well. So yes, in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and all angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, but in that case, the formula I have must still be correct. So what's the problem. Maybe 30 degrees is the acute angle between the vectors, but the formula uses the angles that are supplementary? Because sometimes in crystallography, the angle used is the obtuse angle for the Bravais lattice.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think: if the angle between a and b is alpha =30 degrees, but in some references, the angle used in the interplanar distance formula might be the obtuse angle (e.g., 180 - alpha). So perhaps in the formula, I should use cos(180 - alpha) instead of cos(alpha). Because in the formula, the angle is the one between the vectors, perhaps considered as the angle when the vectors are placed tail to tail.

Wait, that's a possibility. So if alpha is 30 degrees, the actual angle used in the formula could be 180-30=150 degrees. Because when two vectors form a 30-degree angle, the angle in the formula might be the one between the vectors when they're both emanating from the same point, which could be 150 degrees if the rhombohedral angle is considered as the acute one.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me look for the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Alternatively, I can think of the Miller indices and how the structure looks.

Wait, another approach: for a simple cubic structure, the (111) plane interplanar distance is a/sqrt(3). But in a rhombohedral structure, the
