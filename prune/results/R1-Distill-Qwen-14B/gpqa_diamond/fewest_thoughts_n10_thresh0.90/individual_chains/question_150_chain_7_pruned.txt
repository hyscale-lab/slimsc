Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, X (halogens) is 0, and N is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. That's (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees: probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 4) and an aldehyde (1), or maybe a double bond and a ring and a substituent.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) — that's a triplet. High chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group.

Then 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like a pair of doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The protons are probably on adjacent carbons, so maybe two substituents on the benzene ring. Wait, no, if it's a para substitution, each pair would be a doublet. So, possibly two substituents on the benzene, each having two protons that are neighboring.

Then 6.27 (bs, 2H) — broad singlet. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an acidic proton, perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents that are undergoing some hydrogen bonding? Or maybe alkenyl protons, but not sure.

3.66 (d, 2H) — a doublet. So two protons, each coupled to one other. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something else. The chemical shift is around 3.6, which could suggest something like an OCH2 group or a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Putting this together, let's think about possible structures. The aldehyde peak suggests the compound might have an aldehyde group. The benzene ring would be part of the structure. Maybe a benzaldehyde derivative.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. So our compound has C8H9NO, which is one more C, three more H, and one more N and O. So perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an amine or an amide group, but wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Wait, perhaps it's a substituted benzaldehyde with an aminoethyl group or something.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzalacetone-type molecule, or perhaps a nitro group? No, the NMR doesn't show strong deshielded peaks for nitro groups.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm. Aldehyde proton as triplet. So the aldehyde group is adjacent to a CH2 group, because a triplet implies coupling with two protons. So maybe the structure is RCH2CHO. Wait, R being a benzene ring or something else.

Looking at the other NMR peaks. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. Let's think: if the main structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, perhaps a phenyl group attached to a chain.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is a diphenyl aldehyde, but with a side chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the 3.66 ppm doublet. It's 2H, so maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. So perhaps OCH2CH2CHO? Or maybe the CH2 is next to an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons: Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. If we add a substituent with another benzene, that would be C7 (original benzaldehyde) + C1 (another benzene) would be 8? No, wait, original benzaldehyde is C7H6O (if it's benzaldehyde, C6H5CHO is C7H6O). So adding another phenyl group would make it C13, which is way too big. So perhaps it's a mono-substituted benzaldehyde with another group.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like phenyl propanal, but with an oxygen somewhere else.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2CHO. Let me count: OCH2CH2CHO would be OCH2CH2-CHO. But that's only 3 carbons (O, CH2, CH2, CHO). So the molecular formula would be C4H6O2... Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a CH2-O group. Like Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO? No, that might be too many groups.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a methylene group adjacent to another group. Let me think about the structure that would give the 3.66 ppm as a doublet.

Another approach: Let's think about the reagents. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl. That's usually nitrous acid conditions, which is used for diazotization, especially of aromatic amines. So perhaps the starting compound has an aromatic amine group (like aniline) that gets converted into a diazonium salt.

2. H2O. After diazotization, H2O could lead to hydrolysis. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis, especially under certain conditions, to form phenols or other products. Wait, but if the amine is part of a benzene ring, then diazotization would form a diazonium chloride, and hydrolysis would replace the amino group with a hydroxyl group.

3. Aq. KOH and heat. This sounds like conditions for elimination reactions, perhaps the formation of enolates or aldol condensations. Alternatively, it's a base that might cause a substitution or elimination. Wait, but more likely, if we have a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group nearby, under basic conditions, elimination could form an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

So putting this together, the reaction steps are diazotization followed by hydrolysis (replacing an amine with a hydroxyl group), and then a base-induced elimination.

What's the starting compound? Let me re-examine the NMR.

The starting material's NMR has:

- 9.72 ppm: aldehyde proton as triplet, so adjacent to CH2.

- 6.98 and 6.51: para-substituted benzene.

- 6.27: broad singlet, 2H. Could be an -OH group on a benzene ring (phenolic OH) but in an acidic environment, but in D2O it would be exchanged and not appear in the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to another proton, but not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the 6.27 could be the protons of a vinyl group, but in a conjugated system. Like CH2=CHCHO. But then, those protons would be around 5-6 ppm, maybe, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the broad singlet could be due to a -CH2-O- group. Wait, but 3.66 is more likely for an OCH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like (para-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl aldehyde. So, the aldehyde is at the end, and the chain is CH2CH2-OH. No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-(hydroxymethyl)benzaldehyde. Let's see: that would have a benzaldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group. But then the NMR would have a singlet for the aldehyde, and the hydroxymethyl would have protons that might be split into a triplet, but their shift would be around 3.5-4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like 4-(propenyl)benzaldehyde, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(CH2CHO)Ph-OH. Wait, but that would have a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring and a CH2CHO group attached.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 H, 1 N, 1 O.

If the structure has a benzene ring (6 carbons), then two more carbons: perhaps a CH2 group and a carbonyl group (CHO). So, benzaldehyde would be C7H6O. Then, adding a CH2 group connected to something else. Wait, with N in the formula, perhaps the CH2 is connected to a nitro group? No, but the NMR doesn't show a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an amino group. But then, during the reaction, the amino group would be diazotized.

Wait, considering the reaction steps: the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's nitrous acid, which reacts with aromatic amines to form diazonium salts. So, the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group.

Wait, the NMR doesn't show a broad peak for an NH2 group, but maybe the amine is in a different environment. Let me check the starting NMR again. There's a 9.72 triplet, a 6.98 and 6.51 doublets, 6.27 singlet, and 3.66 doublet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(aminophenyl)butanal or something like that. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: the starting compound must have an aromatic amine because the first reagent is nitrous acid. So, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde with an aminoethyl group attached.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene (6 C) + CH2CH2NO group? Wait, let me calculate: 6 C in benzene, plus 2 C in CH2CH2, but that gives 8 C, which matches. So, benzene ring with a substituent that is CH2CH2NO.

Wait, but the substituent would be CH2CH2NO. If that's -CH2CH2NH2, that would add 2 C, but then molecular formula would be C8H11N O? Wait, original formula is C8H9NO. Let me see: Benzene (C6H5) + CH2CH2NH2 (which is C2H5NH2) would give C8H7N O? Hmm, not matching. Maybe the substituent is CH2CHO (which is
