Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. C is the speed of light, as usual. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. There are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativity of velocity. So the first part is about finding the relative velocity between the two astronauts, and the second part is about calculating the total energy.

Let me tackle the relative velocity first. So, I think that the formula for relative velocity in special relativity isn't just v1 - v2. Wait, no, in classical mechanics, it would be, but relativity changes things. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula comes into play here.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formula for the relative velocity u' when one object has velocity u and another has velocity v, both in the same direction, is given by (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, is that correct? Or am I mixing it up? Oh, right, that's when both are moving relative to the same frame. Alternatively, could I be mixing it up with the Lorentz transformation? Let me get this right.

Wait, the problem is about two objects moving in the same direction. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, the relative speed would be the speed of B from A's perspective. Or perhaps the other way around. Wait, the problem says "relative speed," which is the speed between the two, so it depends on which one is the reference frame.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the relative speed when both are moving in the same direction. So, for instance, if I'm on the first astronaut (A) moving at 0.6c, then the second (B) is moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, B's velocity is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, but wait, wait. The formula for velocity addition in relativity is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the frame itself. So if I'm in the frame of A (moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame), then to find B's velocity relative to A, we have u = 0.5c and v = 0.6c, but wait, that's not correct. Because in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is B's velocity?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if the lab frame is S, and astronaut A is moving at v = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at u = 0.5c, both in the same direction. To find the speed of B relative to A, which is moving at 0.6c.

So to find u', which is B's velocity in A's frame, we use u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is 0.5c, v is 0.6c. So plugging in:

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)]

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (0.5 - 0.6)c = (-0.1)c. So the numerator is -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.5*0.6 c²)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3) = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A. But since speed is a positive quantity, the relative speed is 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's about 0.14c.

Wait, looking at the options: option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a possible clue.

Now, for the second part, the total energy of the system. Hmmm. So the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

Each astronaut's energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 2m * gamma1 * c² = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c². So for 2m, it would be E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c².

Wait, no, wait. The mass is given as 2m and 3m. So for the first astronaut, mass is 2m, speed 0.6c.

So E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c².

Similarly for E2: E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c².

So let's compute gamma1 and gamma2.

Gamma1 when v=0.6c:
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Gamma2 when v=0.5c:
Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(4/3) ≈ 1.1547.

Wait, wait, sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E1 = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

E2 = 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ (2.5 + 3.4641) m c² ≈ 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C says E = 5.96 mc².

Option B has E=4.96, D has E=5 mc². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

So putting it together, the relative speed is 0.14c and the energy is about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. Because sometimes I get the formula wrong. The formula for the relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction and you want to find the speed of one relative to the other is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, because if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v - u) if u < v. Wait, in this case, u is 0.5c and v is 0.6c, so u is less than v. So the relative speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, I think I mixed up u and v in the formula earlier.

Wait, when you're in the frame of the object moving at v, and you want to find the speed of an object moving at u in the same direction, then the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). But wait, that would give a negative if u < v, but speed is magnitude, so it's the absolute value.

Wait, so in this case, u is 0.5c, and v is 0.6c. So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) )= (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. So taking the magnitude, it's 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. That's correct.

So the relative speed is 0.14c. So that's option C or D, which both have 0.14c. Now, the energy is 5.96 mc², which is option C. So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. Here's the analysis:

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of astronaut B in the lab frame),
- \( v = 0.6c \) (velocity of astronaut A in the lab frame).

Substituting these values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is the magnitude. Thus, the relative speed is approximately:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

#### Energy of Astronaut A (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
