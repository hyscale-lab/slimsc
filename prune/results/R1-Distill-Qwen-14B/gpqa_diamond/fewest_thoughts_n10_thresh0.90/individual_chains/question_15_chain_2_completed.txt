Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass. So, their radii probably don't vary much because mass and radius are related, but not directly. But wait, no, actually, the radius of the planet affects the depth of the transit, but the probability is about whether the orbit is edge-on enough for us to see the transit. So, the key factors are the size of the star and the size of the orbit.

I think the formula for the probability of a transit is something like (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by some function related to the inclination. Oh right, the probability P is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that part is 1, so it's just (R_star / a).

But wait, R_star is the radius of the star. So for each planet, we compute (R_star / a), and that gives us their transit probabilities.

But wait, the formula I remember is that the transit probability is (R*/a) * (1/(1 - e²)^0.5), but since e=0, it's just R*/a. So higher R* and smaller a (closer orbit) increase the probability.

So for Planet 1 and Planet 2, their probabilities are determined by (R_star_i / a_i) for each.

So let's get the given data:

- Both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

Planet 1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet 2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

We can find the semi-major axis a using Kepler's third law. The law is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) a³. But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M + m ≈ M.

So P² ∝ a³ / M. Therefore, a³ = (P² * G(M)) / (4π²), but since we're comparing a1 and a2, let's set up the ratio.

Let’s denote:

P1 = P2 / 3 → P1 = (1/3) P2.

The host stars have M1 = 2 M2, since Planet 1's star is twice as massive as Planet 2's.

So Kepler's law for each planet:

For Planet 1: (P1)^2 = (4π²/(G M1)) a1^3.

For Planet 2: (P2)^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) a2^3.

Taking the ratio of a1^3 / a2^3 = (P1^2 * M1 ) / (P2^2 * M2 )

Substituting P1 = P2/3, and M1 = 2 M2:

a1^3/a2^3 = ( (P2^2 / 9) * 2 M2 ) / ( P2^2 * M2 ) ) → (2/9) → a1^3/a2^3 = 2/9.

Taking cube roots: a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) → let's compute that.

2 is 2, 9 is 3². So 2/9 = 2/(3²) = (2)^(1/3) / (3)^(2/3) ≈ 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. Alternatively, a2 is a1 * (9/2)^(1/3) → wait, maybe I should compute the exact ratio.

Wait, let's compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 = 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

But wait, the transit probability is (R*/a) → since R* is same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a. So P1 ∝ 1/a1, P2 ∝ 1/a2.

So P1/P2 = (a2 / a1) → because P1 is (R*/a1), P2 (R*/a2). So their ratio is a2/a1.

Since a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2/a1 = 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 → P1/P2 ≈ 1.65.

So Planet 1 has about 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet 2.

Wait, but the options are about which planet is preferred. The researchers choose the one with higher probability. So Planet_1 has higher probability, so their chance is higher than Planet_2.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: 2.7 times, which is higher, so probably not.

Wait, let me check the actual calculation.

Let me compute a1/a2 accurately.

From Kepler's law: (a1^3)/(a2^3) = (P1^2 * M1) / (P2^2 * M2) )

P1 = (1/3) P2.

M1 = 2 M2.

So substituting: a1^3/a2^3 = ( (P2/3)^2 * 2 M2 ) / ( P2^2 * M2 ) )

= [ (P2^2)/(9) * 2 M2 ) ) ] / (P2^2 M2 )

The P2^2 and M2 terms cancel out. So:

= (2 /9 ) → a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

So (2/9) is 2 divided by 9, which is 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So a2 is a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, no, a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3) → because a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) → a2 = a1 / (2/9)^(1/3) )= a1 * (9/2)^(1/3).

Compute (9/2)^(1/3). 

9/2 = 4.5. The cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

Because 1.65^3 is about 1.65 * 1.65 = 2.7225; 2.7225 *1.65 ≈ 4.49, which is about 4.5. So yes, (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 = 1.65 a1.

So the transit probabilities: P1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2 → P2 = (R*/a2) = (R*) / (1.65 a1) ) → which is (1/1.65) * (R*/a1) → so P2 = (1/1.65) P1.

Which means P1 = 1.65 * P2.

So Planet_1's probability is 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So when the researchers choose the one with higher probability, they should choose Planet_1 because it has a higher chance.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. That's correct.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) increases the probability.

### Key Information:
1. **Orbital Periods**: Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), meaning its orbit is three times shorter than Planet_2's.
2. **Host Star Masses**: The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).
3. **Circular Orbits**: Both planets have circular orbits (\( e = 0 \)).
4. **Host Star Radii**: Both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 \)).

### Step 1: Relating Semi-Major Axes Using Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states:
\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}}
\]
For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{P_1^2 M_1}{P_2^2 M_2}
\]
Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \):
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 (2M_2)}{P_2^2 M_2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606a_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]
This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit**.
