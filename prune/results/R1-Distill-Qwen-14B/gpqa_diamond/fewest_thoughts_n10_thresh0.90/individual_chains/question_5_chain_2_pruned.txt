Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Alright, let me try to break this down. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are often represented as matrices, and eigenvectors correspond to their eigenstates. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the operator is likely a combination of the Pauli matrices for X, Y, and Z.

Wait, the question gives me the components of the operator P. Specifically, Px, Py, and Pz are given. Let me write those down.

Px is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix with elements [0 1; 1 0]. That's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [0 -i; i 0], which is the Pauli Y matrix. Pz is (ħ/2) times [1 0; 0 -1], the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P must be the vector sum of these components in the direction of n. Since n lies in the x-z plane, it can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the angle would be θ from the z-axis, with the x and z components. So the operator P would be the sum of its components in the x, y, and z directions multiplied by the direction cosines. But since n is in x-z, the y-component of n is zero. So maybe the operator is P = (P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z) / |n|, but since n is a unit vector, |n|=1.

Wait, actually, for a vector operator, the operator in an arbitrary direction n is given by P·n, which is the sum of each component P_i multiplied by n_i. So, P·n = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n
