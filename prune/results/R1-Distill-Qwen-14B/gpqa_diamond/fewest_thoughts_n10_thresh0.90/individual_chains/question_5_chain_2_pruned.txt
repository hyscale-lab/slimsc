Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, right. So the operator P is a vector operator, I think. So in quantum mechanics, when you have an operator in a particular direction, say n, it's often expressed using the Pauli matrices. Wait, but maybe I should think about the operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So direction n would have components (nx, 0, nz) because it's in the x-z plane, so ny is zero.

Wait, but how does that relate to the operator P? Oh, wait, the operator P would be the vector operator, and for a spin-½ particle, the components are given by P = ħ/2 * σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Because for spin, the operators are S_i = ħ/2 σ_i, right?

But wait, the problem gives the components of P as:

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So yes, that makes sense. Those are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, the operator we're interested in is P along direction n. So the operator P_n would be P · n, which is Px nx + Py ny + Pz nz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P_n = nx Px + nz Pz.

So substituting the matrices:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So that's (ħ/2) times the matrix [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

Because when you add the two matrices, first element is 0 + nz, top right is nx + 0, and so on.

Wait, no, let me re-calculate. The matrix for nx Px is [[0, nx],[nx, 0]], and for nz Pz it's [[nz, 0],[0, -nz]]. So adding them gives [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

So the matrix for operator P_n is (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So we have the matrix equation:

(ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The equation is (P_n - λ I)|ψ> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue. So, since P_n is (ħ/2) * matrix, and λ is ħ/2, then the matrix equation becomes:

[(nz, nx), (nx, -nz)] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Wait, I can factor out the (ħ/2) because both sides are multiplied by it, so the equation simplifies to:

[[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

nz a + nx b = a

nx a - nz b = b

So we set up these two equations.

From the first equation: nz a + nx b = a → a (nz -1) + nx b = 0 → equation (1): a (nz -1) = -nx b.

From the second equation: nx a - nz b = b → nx a = b (nz + 1) → equation (2): a = [b (nz + 1)] / nx.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to subtract the identity matrix. Let me think again. The matrix equation is (M - I) |ψ> = 0, where M is [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

So M - I is [[nz-1, nx], [nx, -nz -1]].

So the equations are:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0 → equation (1)
nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0 → equation (2)

So from equation (1): (nz -1) a = -nx b → a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b.

Wait, but let's plug this into equation (2) to find a relation in terms of a and b.

From equation (1): a = [ -nx / (nz-1) ] b.

Plug into equation (2):

nx * [ (-nx)/(nz-1) b ] + (-nz-1) b = 0.

Let's compute each term:

First term: (nx * (-nx) )/(nz-1) * b = (-nx²)/(nz-1) * b.

Second term: (-nz -1) b.

So the entire equation becomes:

[ (-nx²)/(nz -1) + (-nz -1) ] * b = 0.

Assuming b ≠ 0 (since it's an eigenvector and not the zero vector), the expression in the brackets must be zero.

So:

(-nx²)/(nz -1) + (-nz -1) = 0.

Multiply both sides by (nz -1) to eliminate the denominator:

-nx² + (-nz -1)(nz -1) = 0.

Expanding the second term:

(-nz -1)(nz -1) = (-nz)(nz) + (-nz)(-1) + (-1)(nz) + (-1)(-1)
= -nz² + nz - nz + 1
= -nz² + 0 + 1
= 1 - nz².

So substituting back:

-nx² + (1 - nz²) = 0 → -(nx² + nz²) + 1 = 0 → nx² + nz² = 1.

Which makes sense because n is a unit vector, so nx² + nz² =1.

So the equation reduces to 0=0, meaning that the two equations are not independent. So we can choose a parameter to solve for a and b.

Let me take equation (1): (nz -1) a + nx b = 0 → a = [ nx / (1 - nz) ] b.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to express a in terms of b, then express the eigenvector in terms of a parameter.

So the eigenvector would be proportional to [a; b] = [ nx/(1 - nz) * b, b ]

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to let b = 1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple) and express a accordingly.

So, let me set b = 1, then a = [ nx/(1 - nz) ].

So the eigenvector is [nx/(1 - nz), 1]^T.

But wait, perhaps I can express this in terms of spherical coordinates or angles, since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so it can be expressed in terms of polar angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, maybe φ is 0? Or perhaps it's better to use θ measured from the z-axis.

Wait, let me think: in spherical coordinates, any point on the unit sphere can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since our direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so φ is 0 or π? No, wait, any direction in the x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π, but actually, no, that's not right. Because the x-z plane is spanned by angles φ=0 and φ=π, but any direction in between would involve a different φ. Wait, no. Wait, if n is in the x-z plane, then φ is either 0 or π, because for example, when φ=0, it's along positive x and z. Hmm, perhaps a better way is to express the direction n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be the angle from the z-axis, so the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So for n in the x-z plane, n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: In spherical coordinates, the x component is r sinθ cosφ, y is r sinθ sinφ, z is r cosθ. So if n is in the x-z plane, then the y component is zero, which implies that sinφ must be zero, so φ=0 or π. So for φ=0, n is in the x-z plane with positive x and z. For φ=π, it's negative x and positive z.

Wait, but perhaps for simplicity, we can take direction n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is measured from the z-axis. So in that case, nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So, substituting nx = sinθ, nz= cosθ.

So, our eigenvector components are a = [nx / (1 - nz)] b.

So a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Let me compute 1 - cosθ. Using the trigonometric identity, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So, a = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] * b

Simplify: [2 sinθ/2 cosθ/2 ] / [ 2 sin²θ/2 ] → [cosθ/2 ] / [ sinθ/2 ]

So a = (cosθ/2) / (sinθ/2) ) * b = cot(θ/2) * b.

So the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2).

Which implies that a = cot(θ/2) * b.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T.

Wait, but this is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the eigenvector in terms of spherical harmonics or spin states. Alternatively, maybe we can express it in terms of theta and phi angles, but in this case, phi is zero or pi.

Wait, but let me think about normalization. Once we have the coefficients a and b, we can normalize them.

So the unnormalized eigenvector is [ a; b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

Wait, let me plug in some specific angles to see if that makes sense. For example, when theta is 0, which would mean the direction is along the positive z-axis. Then theta = 0, so theta/2 is 0, cot(0) is infinity, which suggests a problem. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me re-derive this part. Let me go back.

We have:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), as I said, and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ] * b.

Simplify numerator and denominator: 2 cancels, and sin(theta/2) in numerator and denominator gives 1/sin(theta/2).

So a = [ cos(theta/2) ) / sin(theta/2) ] * b = cot(theta/2) * b.

So, yes, correct.

So the eigenvector is in the form [ cot(theta/2) * b, b ].

Let me factor out b.

So, [ a, b ] = b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

To normalize, the
