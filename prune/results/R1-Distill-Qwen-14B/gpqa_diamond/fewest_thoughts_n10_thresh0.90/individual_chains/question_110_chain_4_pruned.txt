Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the question provides information about each star, including their RA, DEC, magnitudes, distances, and some have extinction values. The key point is that each spectrograph has a different limiting magnitude. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 mag, and HIRES can observe brighter than V=16 mag. So, any star that's brighter than 17 mag can be detected by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 mag can be detected by HIRES. But wait, wait—no, actually, the way it's phrased, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Wait, no, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is less than 17. Because the magnitude scale is inverted—lower numbers are brighter.

So for ESPRESSO, stars with V_mag < 17 can be observed. For HIRES, stars with V_mag < 16 can be observed. So to be detected by both, the star's apparent magnitude must be less than 16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, and ESPRESSO can go a bit fainter, but the star has to be within both's limits. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 mag, right? Or wait, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO. Wait no, the way it's written: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed"—so apparent V mag less than 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V_mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars with V_mag ≤16.

Wait, let me get that right. If a star is brighter than V=17, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, V_mag <17 is observable. For HIRES, V_mag <16 is observable.

So for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent magnitude <1
