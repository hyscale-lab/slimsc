Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, wait, operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz.

Right, in quantum mechanics, operators like position, momentum, or spin are often represented as vectors made up of their components. Each component is an operator in 2x2 matrices since spin-1/2 systems are two-level systems.

So, the operator P is a vector operator, and the direction here is an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, but the eigenvector is for the operator along n, which would be the spin component S·n. But in this case, the operator is P, which I think is analogous to spin, so maybe P is an angular momentum operator.

Wait, actually, in the question, they specify that it's the eigenvector of P along direction n. So that would mean we're looking for the eigenstate of P_n, where P_n is the component of P along n.

Wait, but in the problem, they give us Px, Py, and Pz as their matrix representations. So, to find the eigenvector of P along n, which is in the x-z plane, we need to construct the operator P_n and then find its eigenvectors.

Wait, but the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as a unit vector (cosθ, 0, sinθ), since it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero.

Wait, but the operator P is given in terms of its components. So P = P_x x̂ + P_y ŷ + P_z ẑ. But if we're looking along direction n = (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in the x-z plane, then n_y is zero. So the operator P_n is n · P, which is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Ah, right, so the operator we need to find the eigenvector for is P_n = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

But wait, the question says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane." So n can be any direction in that plane, which is parameterized by an angle θ, maybe. So let's think about that.

But wait, the problem is not asking about the general case but rather the normalized eigenvector in terms of the components. So perhaps the answer is expressed in terms of θ and phi or something else.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which looks like a standard spherical coordinate representation of a spin-1/2 state. Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which looks like a spinor representation for some angle θ. Option D has square roots and hbar, which might not be right because eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, and normalization would take care of the hbar.

Wait, but the options have hbar in them, which seems a bit odd because eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because they are states, so they can't have units. Oh, unless the question is being a bit unclear. Wait, the question says the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the options have hbar, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvectors are vectors in a Hilbert space and should be unit vectors (length 1), so their components should be unitless. That makes me think that perhaps the options with hbar are wrong, but let me double-check.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)

Wait, that would have units of ħ, which doesn't make sense for a state vector. So perhaps the options are written with a typo. Alternatively, maybe the hbar is part of the given matrices but not the eigenvectors.

Wait, looking back, the question gives the components of P as ħ/2 multiplied by matrices. So P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], etc. So the operator P has units of ħ, which makes sense for angular momentum.

But for the eigenvector, the components would just be complex numbers, possibly with factors of cos and sin, but without ħ. So options A and D have ħ, which might be incorrect. So perhaps I can eliminate them.

But I'm not entirely sure, maybe I should proceed.

So the approach is to construct the operator P_n and find its eigenvectors.

Let me think about the direction n. Since it's in the x-z plane, let's parameterize it with an angle θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_z = cosθ. But since n is in the x-z plane, φ can be taken as 0 or another value? Wait, no, for an arbitrary direction in x-z, φ can be any angle, but wait, since n is along x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to represent it as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if θ is measured from the x-axis. Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) with θ being the angle from the z-axis. Hmm, wait, sometimes θ is measured from the z-axis (like in spherical coordinates), so that's probably the case here.

Wait, no, in standard spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the positive z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ (around the z-axis) can be anything, but in our case, since the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, maybe φ is arbitrary. But in this problem, perhaps we can just take φ=0 to simplify, because the problem is about an arbitrary direction, but the eigenvector might be expressed in terms of θ and φ.

But perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's proceed.

So, P_n is n·P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that n is in the x-z plane, let's say n = (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

We can write n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis. So θ=0 is along z, θ=pi/2 is along x.

So, P_n = (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

We can compute this operator, then find its eigenvectors.

Given that P_x = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], and P_z = (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, substituting:

P_n = (sinθ)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

= (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me compute that matrix.

The first element is cosθ*(ħ/2) from P_z, and 0 from P_x.

Wait no, let's compute each element.

Matrix Pn will be:

Top-left element: (sinθ)*(0) + (cosθ)*(1) * (ħ/2) → cosθ*(ħ/2)
Top-right element: (sinθ)*(1) + (cosθ)*(0) → sinθ * (ħ/2)
Bottom-left: (sinθ)*(1) + (cosθ)*(0) → sinθ*(ħ/2)
Bottom-right: (sinθ)*(0) + (cosθ)*(-1) → -cosθ*(ħ/2)

So Pn = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So, the matrix is:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ   sinθ ]
        [ sinθ  -cosθ ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Wait, the operator Pn is given by this matrix. We need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of Pn can be found by solving the characteristic equation:

det( Pn - λ I ) = 0

So, the matrix (Pn - λ I) is:

(ħ/2 cosθ - λ)   (ħ/2 sinθ)
(ħ/2 sinθ)       ( -ħ/2 cosθ - λ )

The determinant is:

( (ħ/2 cosθ - λ) ) * ( -ħ/2 cosθ - λ ) ) - ( ħ/2 sinθ )^2 = 0

Let me compute this determinant.

Let me factor out (ħ/2)^2:

= ( ( ħ/(2) cosθ - λ ) ) * ( - ( ħ/(2) cosθ ) - λ ) ) - ( ( ħ/2 sinθ ) )^2 = 0

Alternatively, let me multiply out the terms.

Expanding the first term:

( ħ/2 cosθ - λ ) ( - ħ/2 cosθ - λ ) 
= ( - (ħ/2 cosθ)^2 - ħ/2 cosθ λ + ħ/2 cosθ λ + λ^2 )
Wait, wait, actually, it's (a - λ)(b - λ) where a = ħ/2 cosθ, b = -ħ/2 cosθ.

Wait, no, more accurately, it's (a - λ)(b - λ) where a = (ħ/2 cosθ) and b = (-ħ/2 cosθ).

Wait, no, the first term is (a - λ), where a is (ħ/2 cosθ), and the second is (b - λ), where b is (-ħ/2 cosθ). So when you multiply, you get (a - λ)(b - λ) = ab - aλ - bλ + λ².

Compute ab: (ħ/2 cosθ)(-ħ/2 cosθ) = -(ħ^2/4) cos^2θ.

Then, -aλ -bλ = -λ (a + b) → a + b = (ħ/2 cosθ) + (-ħ/2 cosθ) = 0.

So the product becomes ab + λ² → -(ħ²/4 cos²θ) + λ².

The second term is (ħ/2 sinθ)^2 → (ħ²/4 sin²θ).

So the determinant is [ -(ħ²/4 cos²θ) + λ² ] - (ħ²/4 sin²θ) = 0.

So,

λ² - (ħ²/4 cos²θ) - (ħ²/4 sin²θ) ) = 0

Factor out ħ²/4:

λ² - (ħ²/4)( cos²θ + sin²θ ) ) = 0

But cos²θ + sin²θ =1, so:

λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ±ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, which makes sense because we're dealing with spin-1/2 systems.

So the question asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, to find the eigenvector, we solve (Pn - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

The matrix (Pn - (ħ/2) I) is:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2)   (ħ/2 sinθ)       ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)          ( -ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ) ]

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ (cosθ -1)     sinθ           ]
          [ sinθ          (-cosθ -1)     ]

So, the equation is:

(ħ/2) [ (cosθ -1)     sinθ           ] [a]   = 0
          [ sinθ          (-cosθ -1)     ] [b]

Since ħ/2 ≠ 0, the matrix multiplied by [a; b] must equal zero. So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

These two equations must be satisfied.

Let me take the first equation:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0 → (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ) ] b.

Simplify the denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ ) → a = [ - sinθ / (-(1 - cosθ)) ) ] b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b.

We can simplify sinθ / (1 - cosθ ). Recall that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2).

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So, the eigenvector can be written in terms of b. Let's set b = 1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar) for simplicity.

Then, a = cot(theta/2) * 1 → a = cot(theta/2).

Wait, but let's double-check. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the components in terms of θ/2.

Wait, another approach is to express the ratio a/b as cot(theta/2).

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But wait, in terms of the components, this would be [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ].

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by some factor.

Wait, let me see: Let's consider the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Let me check if this is an eigenvector.

Let me plug into the equation (Pn - (ħ/2) I) acting on this vector equals zero.

Compute each component.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is to note that the eigenstates of the spin component along any direction are given by the spinor:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) | -z>,

where theta is the polar angle (from z-axis) and phi is the azimuthal angle.

But in our case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi can be set to zero or any value, but in the options, option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ ), which looks similar but perhaps not exactly the same. Wait, option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is exactly the form I was thinking.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the eigenvector came out as [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Which is [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ]

But that can be rewritten as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by 1/sin(theta/2). Wait, but that would change the vector's normalization.

Wait, because the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is already a unit vector. Let me check.

The magnitude squared would be cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1. So it's normalized.

Wait, but from the equation, a = cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so the vector would be [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ]

But that vector isn't normalized unless we divide by sqrt( (cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2)) / sin^2(theta/2) ) ).

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the vector [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] is proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Let me see: cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So, the vector [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ] can be written as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2).

Wait, so the normalized vector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] because it's already normalized.

Wait, but wait, if we have a vector [ a, b ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], then when we apply the matrix (Pn - (ħ/2) I), do we get zero?

Let me compute that.

The matrix (Pn - (ħ/2) I) is (ħ/2) times:

[ cosθ -1 , sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ]

Multiplying this by [ a, b ] gives:

Top component: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b

Bottom component: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b

If a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2 ), let's compute the top component:

cosθ * cos(theta/2) - cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2 )

= cos(theta/2) [ cosθ - 1 ] + sin(theta/2) sinθ

Hmm, I'm not sure if this equals zero. Let's compute it for a specific theta.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of trigonometric identities.

Wait, let me calculate cosθ and sinθ in terms of theta/2.

Using double-angle formulas:

cosθ = 2 cos^2(theta/2) - 1

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

Top component:

[ 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 -1 ] * cos(theta/2) + [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2 )

Simplify:

[ 2 cos^2(theta/2) - 2 ] * cos(theta/2) + 2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

Factor 2 cos(theta/2):

2 cos(theta/2) [ cos^2(theta/2) - 1 ] + 2 cos(theta/2) sin^2(theta/2 )

Wait, [ cos^2(theta/2) -1 ] = - sin^2(theta/2 )

So,

= 2 cos(theta/2) (- sin^2(theta/2) ) + 2 cos(theta/2) sin^2(theta/2 )

= -2 cos(theta/2) sin^2(theta/2) + 2 cos(theta/2) sin^2(theta/2 )

= 0.

So yes, the top component is zero.

Similarly, let's compute the bottom component:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1 ) b

= 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) + ( - [2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 ] -1 ) * sin(theta/2 )

Simplify term by term:

First term: 2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2 )

Second term: [ -2 cos^2(theta/2) +1 -1 ] sin(theta/2 ) → [ -2 cos^2(theta/2) ] sin(theta/2 )

So,

= 2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2 ) - 2 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2 )

= 0.

So both components are zero, which means the vector [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] is indeed an eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Therefore, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is another way of writing a spinor but perhaps for a different convention.

Wait, but wait a moment. In the calculation above, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero, but in the general case, the eigenvector would have a phase factor dependent on phi. But in our problem, since n is in the x-z plane, phi can be taken as 0 without loss of generality, but the problem says it's an arbitrary direction, so perhaps the eigenvector should include a phase factor of e^{i phi}.

Wait, but in our calculation, when we set phi=0, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But the problem asks for the eigenvector in general. So perhaps the correct form is option B or option C.

Wait, the option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is a different form. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector is expressed in terms of theta, which is the angle from the z-axis, but in the spinor representation, it's often expressed as cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which would correspond to option C.

But wait, looking back, the problem gives the components of the operator as P_x, P_y, and P_z, each scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, but in the eigenvector we found, the components are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], without any ħ factors. So the correct option would be option C.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes, that's exactly what we found. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait a second—another thing to consider: the eigenvector could have a global phase factor, but that doesn't change the vector. So, the normalization is correct because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are represented as 2x2 matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $P_n$
The operator $P_n$ is the component of $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$, given by:
\[
P_n = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrix representations of $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we find:
\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of $P_n$
The eigenvalues of $P_n$ are determined by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\det(P_n - \lambda I) = 0.
\]
The determinant calculation yields:
\[
\lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are $+\hbar/2$ and $-\hbar/2$.

### Step 3: Find the eigenvector for $\lambda = +\hbar/2$
To find the eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda = +\hbar/2$, we solve:
\[
(P_n - \frac{\hbar}{2} I) |v\rangle = 0.
\]
Substituting $P_n - \frac{\hbar}{2} I$:
\[
P_n - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\]
From the first equation, $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$. Choosing $b = 1$ (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar), we find:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This vector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents a general spinor but does not match the derived eigenvector for $\lambda = +\hbar/2$.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Includes $\hbar$ and additional factors, which are inconsistent with the normalized eigenvector.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$, corresponding to **Option C**.

Answer: C
