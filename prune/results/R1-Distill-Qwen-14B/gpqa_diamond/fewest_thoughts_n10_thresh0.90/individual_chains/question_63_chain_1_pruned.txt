Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there's a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. They want to know what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

The given data includes the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. Let me jot down the numbers:

Mx = 20 amu
My = 2 amu
R = 2 angstroms
w = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, what's the fundamental state in this context? Oh right, in the rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state. So the molecule is in the ground state of both vibration and rotation.

When a photon is absorbed, it must have enough energy to cause a transition. Since they're asking about the next lowest energy state, I think that's when either the vibrational state increases by one, the rotational state increases by one, or both. But wait, the next lowest state probably refers to the next higher energy state overall, which would be the first excited state. So I need to figure out what the energy levels look like.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy is Er = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where J is the rotational quantum number and I is the moment of inertia.

The fundamental state is the lowest, so n=0 and J=0. The next state would be either n=1 or J=1. But I think the next possible energy level is either the first vibrational excited state (n=1) or the first rotational excited state (J=1). Which one requires less energy?

Let me compute the energies for both transitions.

First, the vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1. The energy difference is Ev = (1 + 1/2)ħω - (0 + 1/2)ħω = ħω. So the photon energy would be ħω.

For the rotational transition, from J=0 to J=1. The change in energy is Er = [ (1*(1+1) ) / (2I) ] * ħ². I need to calculate I, the moment of inertia.

I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ is (Mx*My)/(Mx + My). Let's compute that.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. But wait, amu needs to be converted into kg for SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.011e-27 kg.

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.011e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.011e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2044e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational energy difference when J increases by 1 (from 0 to 1):

ΔEr = [ (1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1) ) * ħ² ] / (2I )
= [2 - 0] * ħ²/(2I)
= (2 * ħ²) / (2I)
= ħ² / I

Wait, let me recheck. The energy levels are Er = [ J(J+1) ] * ħ²/(2I)
So ΔEr from J=0 to J=1 is [ (1*2) - (0*1) ] * ħ²/(2I) = (2 - 0) * ħ²/(2I) = (2) * ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So yes, ΔEr = ħ² / I.

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So let's compute ΔEr:

ΔEr = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2044e-46) 

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) (since (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68, and 1.05457^2≈1.112).

So 1.112e-68 / 1.2044e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.2044) * 1e-22 ≈ approx 0.923 * 1e-22 = 9.23e-23 J.

Wait, but what about the vibrational photon energy? Ev = ħw.

Given w is 4e14 rad/s.

So Ev = 1.05457e-34 Js *4e14 Hz = 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, so the rotational transition requires about 9.23e-23 J, which is about 0.92e-22 J, and the vibrational requires 4.2e-20 J. So the vibrational transition requires more energy. So which transition is lower in energy?

Wait, wait, 9.23e-23 J is lower than 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon with lower energy is for the rotational change.

Wait, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule could transition either vibrationally or rotationally, whichever requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the lower of the two.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational and vibrational energies are coupled, so the state transitions involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states. Or do they? Or are they separate aspects?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is n=0, J=0.

The next possible state with the lowest energy could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. Because each of these has higher energy than the ground state. So which of these two options has a lower energy?

Compute the energies for both and compare.

Compute ΔE for n=1, J=0.

ΔE_vib = Ev(n=1) - Ev(n=0) = (1 + 1/2)ħw - (0 + 1/2)ħw = ħw = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approx 4.218e-20 J.

ΔE_rot = Er(J=1) - Er(J=0) = [ (1*2) - (0*1) ] * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I) = same as before, about 9.23e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational. So the photon would need to have the energy corresponding to the rotational transition, which is lower.

Wait, but the question is, which transition can the molecule make when a photon is absorbed. So the photon's energy must match either the rotational energy difference or the vibrational energy difference. But to find the next state with the lowest possible energy, the molecule would prefer the lower energy transition. So the photon's energy should be the rotational one.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Because the non-rigid rotor model includes both rotation and vibration. Hmm, perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both, so the next state could be a combination of a higher J and n.

Wait
