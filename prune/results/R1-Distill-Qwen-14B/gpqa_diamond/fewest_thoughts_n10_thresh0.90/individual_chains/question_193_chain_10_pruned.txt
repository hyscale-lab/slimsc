Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the power of 5. So the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5, I think. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are various powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance d in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax plx. So d = 1/plx. Oh wait, right, that makes sense because closer stars have larger parallax (since they appear to move more as we orbit).

So if I have N proportional to 1/plx^5, and I want to express N in terms of distance d, I can substitute plx as 1/d. Let's do that. So plx = 1/d, so 1/plx would be d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me check again.

Wait, N varies with 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d, plx^5 is (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think that's asking about the number of stars per a certain distance interval, like how many more stars you get when you go from r to r+dr, compared to being at a smaller distance.

Wait, maybe it's about the number density, like the number per unit distance. Or perhaps it's about the differential: the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then how does the number in a shell (which depends on the derivative) change with d.

Oh right, because the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d (with radius d and thickness dr) is given by
