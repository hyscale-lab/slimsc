Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see if I can figure out what's going on.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. So Y is some element that forms five different binary fluorides.

Substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, like 25°C) into A2 and fluorine gas. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing usually means it's a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, so for it to be oxidized, A1 must be a very strong oxidizing agent.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So maybe A3 is another fluoride of Y. Since fluorinating Y gives A3, perhaps A3 is YF, or maybe YF3 or something else. But wait, if A1 is bright red, what could that be? I'm thinking of some common red fluorides. Oh wait, I remember that Y is likely to be iodine because iodine forms several fluorides, and some are red. Like, I think I2F7 is a red solid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let me think again. The decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. If A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, that suggests a decomposition reaction where a higher fluoride breaks down into a lower one and releases F2.

For example, let's say A1 is YF5. If it decomposes, maybe it becomes YF3 (A2) and F2 gas. Because YF5 → YF3 + F2. Let me check the formula. If YF5 → YF3 + F2, then the reaction would be YF5 → YF3 + F2. Let me balance it: YF5 → YF3 + F2. So 2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2. That makes sense because 2*(YF5) → 2*(YF3) + (F2). So in this case, A1 would be YF5, A2 would be YF3.

Wait, but what about the oF value (I think ɷF is the oxidation state of F)? Oh, wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%", but I'm not sure what that refers to. Oh wait, maybe it's the percentage composition of fluorine in A2. So A2 has fluorine making up 31.96% of its mass. Let me calculate that.

If A2 is YF3, then the molecular formula is YF3. Let's assume Y is iodine (I) because I know I has multiple fluorides. So Y is I, atomic weight about 127 g/mol. Fluorine is about 19 g/mol. So molecular weight of YF3 is 127 + 3*19 = 127 + 57 = 184 g/mol. The fluorine content would be (3*19)/184 *100% = 57/184*100 ≈31.0%. Oh wait, the question says 31.96%, which is close to 31.0. So that fits. So A2 is likely IF3.

So A1 is IF5, which is a red solid. When it decomposes, it forms IF3 and F2. So when A1 is heated, it breaks down. That makes sense because IF5 is known to decompose into IF3 and F2 upon heating.

Then, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, but under certain conditions can be oxidized. I remember that in fluorine chemistry, highly fluorinated compounds can be strong oxidizing agents. So IF5, being a strong oxidizing agent, could oxidize xenon, perhaps to form XeF2 or XeF4 or something.

A3 is another fluoride of Y, obtained by fluorinating Y. Wait, but if Y is already in a higher oxidation state, perhaps A3 is another form. Alternatively, maybe A3 is YF7, but wait, for Y=I, YF7 is actually I7F, which isn't stable, so perhaps Y is another element. Wait, perhaps Y is chlorine? No, because Cl doesn't form five binary fluorides. Let me think again.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition of A1. If A1 is a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower one plus F2, then Y must have multiple oxidation states. Iodine, for example, can have +1, +3, +5, +7 oxidation states. So YF5 would be I in +5 oxidation state. Decomposing to YF3 (I in +3) and F2 (which is 0 oxidation state). So that fits.

Then, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So if Y is in a lower oxidation state, fluorinating it would increase the oxidation state. For example, if Y is in 0 state (elemental Y), fluorinating would give YF, YF2, etc. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps fluorinating Y would form YF3. Hmm, but YF3 is already a fluoride we have here. Alternatively, maybe Y is in a higher oxidation state.

Wait, but the problem says A3 can also interact with xenon. So perhaps it's another strong oxidizing agent, but maybe it's a different compound.

Moving on: A4 is another compound. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

Let me think about A4 and A5. If A4 is a solution, maybe it's a fluoride of Y. Or perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let's consider that when Y is added to A4, it forms A5. For example, maybe A4 is a solution of YF4, and adding Y (like Y metal) would produce H2 gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a salt that reacts with Y. Let's say if Y is iodine, but in solution, maybe A4 is an iodide solution. But wait, the solution is colorless, which might not fit if Y is iodine (as iodine solutions are usually brown). Hmm, maybe Y is another element.

Wait, another angle: when Y is added to a hot concentrated solution of A4, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. For example, maybe A4 is a fluoride compound that reacts with Y metal to form a new compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt like YF3, and adding Y in a 1:1 ratio leads to a different compound. Or maybe it's a reaction where Y is acting as a reducing agent or something else.

Then, when A5 is in water, it decomposes into two substances. Maybe it's a salt that breaks down into an acid and a base, or perhaps it's something like a diatomic molecule.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a diatomic molecule that breaks into two atoms. For example, if A5 is O2 or O3, but that seems unrelated. Or maybe it's something like H2O breaking down, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition. If A5 decomposes in water into two substances, maybe it's something like NaH decomposing into Na and H2. Or maybe CaF2 decomposes into Ca^2+ and F^- ions, but that's not decomposition into two substances, just dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a diatomic molecule that splits into two atoms. Like maybe O2 decomposes into O atoms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe A5 is H2O2, which decomposes into H2O and O2. But that's two products, but the problem says into two substances. So that's a possibility.

But I'm not sure how that connects to the rest of the problem.

Let me try to list the compounds I know:

A1: YF5 (bright red, decomposes into YF3 and F2, so Y is I, A1 is IF5)
A2: YF3 (IF3)
A3: another fluoride of Y, perhaps YF (if Y is in +1 oxidation state), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says there are five binary compounds. For Y=I, the known fluorides are IF, IF3, IF5, IF7, and perhaps I2F7. Wait, I think I2F7 is a possible compound, so that would be five compounds. So possible A3 could be I2F7, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but when A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, perhaps Y is in a lower oxidation state. For example, if Y is in 0 state (elemental), fluorinating would form YF. So A3 is YF.

But I'm not certain. Let me proceed.

A4 is another compound. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. So A4 could be a solution of a salt like YF4, perhaps. Wait, but YF4 for I would be IF4, which I'm not sure exists. Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a different compound.

Wait, another approach: when Y is added to a solution of a salt, perhaps it's a displacement reaction. For example, if A4 is a solution of YF3 and Y is added, maybe it's a reduction. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a metal fluoride, and adding Y (the same metal) in a 1:1 ratio leads to a different compound.

Wait, another angle: A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Maybe A5 is something like CaF2, which upon hydrolysis gives HF and Ca(OH)2, but that's two products. Alternatively, perhaps it's NaF, but that doesn't decompose much. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a diatomic molecule like F2, but that's not a compound. If A5 is F2, then in water it would react to produce HF and O2 or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A5 is something like O2F2, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps it's ClF3, but that's not relevant.

Wait, maybe A5 is a salt that breaks down, like NaHCO3 decomposing into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O, but that's more than two products.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a diatomic molecule that splits into two atoms. For example, O2 → 2O or something, but that's not a typical decomposition.

Wait, perhaps A5 is H2O2, which decomposes into H2O and O2. So that's two products.

But how does that connect to the rest of the problem? Let's think.

So, A4 is a compound that, when Y is added in a 1:1 ratio, forms A5. Then A5 decomposes in water into two substances. If A5 is H2O2, then A4 must be something that reacts with Y to produce H2O2.

Wait, but Y is an element that forms five fluorides. So Y is probably I, as earlier thought. So if A4 is a solution of something, perhaps it's a fluoride solution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4. When Y is added, maybe it's a redox reaction. For example, Y (elemental) could reduce YF4 to YF3 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps adding Y to YF4 in a 1:1 ratio produces YF2? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5, but that's A1, which is already known.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the molecular weight of A4. The options are ranges, so I need to figure out which range fits A4.

If A4 is YF5, which is A1, but the question says A4 is a solution, perhaps it's a different compound. Alternatively, maybe A4 is YF3, which is A2, but then A5 would be something else.

Wait, another approach: when Y is added to a solution of A4, getting A5. Let's say Y is I, and A4 is a solution of IF3
