Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Oh wait, but wait—when calculating relative speed in relativity, I can't just subtract the velocities like I would in classical mechanics. Right, because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. So I'll need to use that.

First, I need to find the relative speed between them. Let me recall the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, or is it (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1 v2)/(c²)) when adding? Wait no, wait. If both are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²), but wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me double-check.

Wait, the relativistic velocity addition formula is for when you have two velocities u and v in the same inertial frame. To find the velocity of one frame as seen from another, it's (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²) when they're moving in the same direction. But in this problem, I think we're considering the velocity of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So for example, the astronaut moving at 0.6c is moving relative to the one at 0.5c. So I need to subtract.

Wait, let me think. Let's say astronaut A is moving at velocity u = 0.6c relative to an inertial frame S. Astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction in the same frame S. Now, from B's frame, what is A's velocity? So in the S frame, A is at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So from B's frame, the relative velocity would be the velocity of A minus the velocity of B, but adjusted for relativity.

So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Let me plug the numbers in. u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (0.1c)/(0.7) = (0.1/0.7)c ≈ 0.1428c ≈ 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, so looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that narrows it down to C or D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. The total energy would be the sum of their relativ
