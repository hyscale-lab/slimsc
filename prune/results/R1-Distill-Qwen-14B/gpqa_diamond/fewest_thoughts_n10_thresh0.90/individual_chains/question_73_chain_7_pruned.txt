Okay, so I’ve got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but let me think this through step by step.

The question says that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The problem is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So for the relative speed, I remember that in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. Let me recall that formula. I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²), but wait, wait. Because both are moving in the same direction, right? So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So from the perspective of astronaut 2, what is the speed of astronaut 1?

Wait, actually, when we talk about relative speed, we have to consider who's the observer. So if astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c, and astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c in the same direction, then from astronaut 2's frame, astronaut 1 is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Let me plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7. That's approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So I think the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's a start.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm. The system consists of both astronauts. So their energies would be their relativistic energies. Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c squared. So I’ll need to calculate each of their energies and sum them.

Wait, the masses are 2m and 3m. So for astronaut 1: energy E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c². Similarly, E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c². Then total energy E = E1 + E2.

What are the gammas? Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for astronaut 1, v is 0.6c. So v squared is 0.36 c². 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma1 = 1/0.8 = 1.25. Similarly for astronaut 2, v is 0.5c. v squared is 0.25 c². So 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Gamma2 = 1 / (sqrt(0.75)) = approximately 1.1547.

So let me compute E1 and E2.

E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².
E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the combination that includes 5.96 and 0.14c is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the gamma calculations. For v=0.6c: gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.36)) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8=1.25. Correct.

For v=0.5c: gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.154
