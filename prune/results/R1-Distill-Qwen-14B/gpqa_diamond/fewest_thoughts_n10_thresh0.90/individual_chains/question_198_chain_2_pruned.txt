Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, the dithiocyanato complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+. Oh, wait, no, wait. Cobalt can form different complexes with SCN-. The blue one is probably the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Or maybe it's another. No, wait, I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So the question is asking about the percentage of the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex relative to all cobalt species.

Stability constants are given as β1 to β4. Stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for each complex, βn is the constant for Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}.

So the complexes would be:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^{2- n}, with K = βn.

Wait, but the charges: Co is +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So for n SCN, the complex's charge would be 2 - (n)(1) = 2 -n. So for n=1, charge is +1 (CoSCN^+?), no, wait, wait. Let me think: Co^2+ plus 1 SCN^- gives CoSCN^+ (charge 2+ -1 = +1). For n=2, it's Co(SCN)_2^0? Because 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. Oh, that makes sense. So the dithiocyanato complex is neutral.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato", which
