Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with coordination complexes and stability constants. But let's take it step by step. Maybe I can figure it out.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Hmm, wait. So first, I think the problem is about the different complexes that cobalt can form with thiocyanate. The stability constants (β) indicate how stable each complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β4 is 16, which is less than β3 (63) and β2 (40), but higher than β1 (9).

Wait, wait. What's the structure of these complexes? I remember that for metal ions, they can form complexes with ligands. The number in the β probably refers to the number of ligand molecules attached. Like, β1 would be [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 [Co(SCN)₃]^- or something, and β4 [Co(SCN)₄]^2- maybe? But I'm not entirely sure about the charges. But I think the key is that each β corresponds to the number of SCN- ligands attached.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands. So which complex is that? I think the blue complex is [Co(SCN)₂]^{n}, but I'm not sure what the charge is. Maybe it's [Co(SCN)₂]^0? Or [Co(SCN)₂]^2+? Hmm, not sure, but maybe that's not critical right now.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So that's the [Co(SCN)₂] complex, which would be the second complex in the series, corresponding to β2=40. Wait, no. Wait, the numbering could be a bit tricky. Let me think. The stability constants are β1, β2, β3, β4. So β1 is for the first complex, which is monomeric: [Co(SCN)]^{n-} or something. So β2 would be for the di-substituted complex, which is the dithiocyanato one. So that's the one we're interested in.

But wait, I need to find the concentration of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex relative to all the cobalt species. So, the total cobalt is the sum of all possible species: Co²+ plus each of the complexes. So [Co]total = [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)3]^− + [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

But wait, the stability constants are given for each step. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+ from Co²+ and SCN−. β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, which is formed from [CoSCN]^+ and another SCN−. Similarly, each β adds another SCN−.

Wait, perhaps I should model the formation of each complex step by step. Let me think about the general approach.

The formation of each complex is a stepwise process, and the overall formation constant for each complex can be found by multiplying the stepwise β's. But sometimes, the overall β is given. Wait, in the question, the β1, β2, β3, β4 are the stepwise constants.

So for each complex, the formation constant is the product of the β's up to that point. For example, the formation of [Co(SCN)₂] would require two steps: the first β1 and the second β2. So the overall β for the di-substituted complex is β1 * β2.

Wait no, I think each β is the formation constant for adding one more SCN−. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of β1 through βn. Wait, no, perhaps each β is the formation constant for the next step. So, for [CoSCN]^+, β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN−]).

Then, for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, the formation would be [Co(SCN)₂^0]/([CoSCN+] [SCN−}) ) = β2.

So, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is β1 * β2.

Similarly, β3 is the stepwise constant for adding a third SCN−, so the overall for [Co(SCN)3]^− is β1β2β3.

And β4 would be the stepwise for the fourth, so overall for [Co(SCN)4]^2- is β1β2β3β4.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that each β is the overall constant for the entire n-ligand complex, but I think the first approach is correct, where each β is the stepwise addition. So the overall formation constants are products of β1 to βn.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps each β is the overall constant for the n-ligand complex. So β1 is the constant for [CoSCN]⁺, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

If that's the case, then each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (the di-substituted complex) in the solution, given the concentrations of Co²+ (total) and SCN−.

Wait, but the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which includes all the species: Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc.

The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is high. So maybe most of the Co²+ is complexed, but let's see.

The approach to solve this is to model the distribution of Co²+ among all possible complexes considering the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

But this can get complicated because there are four possible complexes, each with their own stability constants. So perhaps we can use the method of successive approximations or the assumption that the higher complexes are more stable, so their concentrations are higher, but let's see.

Alternatively, since the problem is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, perhaps the dominant species is the one with the highest β, but that's not necessarily the case because the concentration of SCN− affects this.

Wait, the overall approach is to find the fraction of each complex in the solution, given the stability constants and the concentrations.

The general approach is:

Each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} has a formation constant K_n. The fraction f_n of each complex is given by:

f_n = (K_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n) / (denominator)

But the denominator is the sum over all possible species of their respective K's multiplied by [SCN^-]^m, where m is the number of ligands for each species.

Wait, that's a bit involved. Let's think in terms of the distribution of the metal-ligand species.

The general formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n) / ( [Co]^total * Σ (K_m [SCN]^m) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the total concentration.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the complexes:

c_total = [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)₂]^0 + [Co(SCN)3]^− + [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

Each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of [Co²+] and the product of the formation constants and [SCN]^n.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the distribution using the formation constants. Let me try.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then, [CoSCN+] would be K1 * x * [SCN], where K1 is β1.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 would be K2 * [CoSCN+] * [SCN] = K2 * K1 x [SCN]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3]^− would be K3 * [Co(SCN)₂]^0 * [SCN] = K3 * K2 * K1 x [SCN]^3.

And [Co(SCN)4]^2− would be K4 * [Co(SCN)3]^− * [SCN] = K4 * K3 * K2 * K1 x [SCN]^4.

So each [Co(SCN)_n] complex can be represented in terms of x and [SCN]^n, multiplied by the product of K1 to Kn.

So, the total cobalt concentration is:

c_total = x + (K1 x [SCN]) + (K1 K2 x [SCN]^2) + (K1 K2 K3 x [SCN]^3) + (K1 K2 K3 K4 x [SCN]^4)

But wait, the problem is that K1, K2, etc., are the stepwise constants. So perhaps each subsequent K is multiplied by the previous ones.

Wait, no, in the initial approach, each K represents the step. But maybe it's better to think in terms of the overall formation constants. Let me clarify:

Let me define the overall formation constant for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, as K1 = β1.

The overall for the second, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, is K2 = β1 * β2.

Similarly, K3 = β1 β2 β3, and K4 = β1 β2 β3 β4.

So [CoSCN+] = K1 x [SCN]

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 = K2 x [SCN]^2

[Co(SCN)3]^− = K3 x [SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)4]^2− = K4 x [SCN]^4

So the total [Co] is:

x + K1 x [SCN] + K2 x [SCN]^2 + K3 x [SCN]^3 + K4 x [SCN]^4 = c_total

But c_total is given as 1e-2 M.

Wait, but the problem is that we have four complexes, and the equation would involve x and [SCN], but [SCN] is given as 0.1 M. Wait, the [SCN] in solution is 0.1 M. But when we form the complexes, the free [SCN] would decrease, but in this problem, the total SCN concentration is given, and it's 0.1 M. So perhaps we can assume that the concentration of SCN is very high, so the free [SCN] is approximately equal to 0.1 M, and the change due to complexation is negligible. Hmm, but is that a valid assumption?

Wait, the initial [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. If the concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and each complex can bind up to four SCN^- ions, the total SCN used would be up to 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M. The total is 0.1 M, so 0.04 is much less than 0.1, so the change in [SCN] would be small. So perhaps approximating [SCN] as 0.1 M is acceptable.

So, substituting [SCN] = 0.1 M.

Then, the equation becomes:

x + K1 x (0.1) + K2 x (0.1)^2 + K3 x (0.1)^3 + K4 x (0.1)^4 = 1e-2

But K1=β1=9, K2=β1*β2=9*40=360, K3=9*40*63=9*40=360, 360*63=22680, K4=22680*16=362880.

Wait, let me calculate each K:

K1 = 9

K2 = 9 *40 = 360

K3=9*40*63 = 22680

K4=9*40*63*16= 362880.

So now, substituting:

x [1 + 9*(0.1) + 360*(0.1)^2 + 22680*(0.1)^3 + 362880*(0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2

Wait, let me compute each term:

Compute each term inside the brackets:

1) 1

2) 9*0.1=0.9

3) 360*(0.1)^2 =360*0.01=3.6

4) 22680*(0.1)^3 =22680 *0.001=22.68

5) 362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

Adding all these together:

1 + 0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So the equation is x * 64.468 = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

So [Co²+] is approximately 1.551e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN+] = K1 x [SCN] =9 * 1.551e-4 *0.1 =9 * 1.551e-5=1.3959e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0= K2 x [SCN]^2=360 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2=360 *1.551e-4 *0.01=360 *1.551e-6=5.5836e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^−= K3 x [SCN]^3=22680 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^3=22680 *1.551e-4 *0.001=22680 *1.551e-7=3.524e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^2−= K4 x [SCN]^4=362880 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^4=362880 *1.551e-4 *0.0001=362880 *1.551e-8=5.632e-3 M.

Wait, let me check those calculations:

Wait, [CoSCN+] =9 * x *0.1.

x is 1.551e-4.

So 9 * 1.551e-4 *0.1 =9 *1.551e-5 = 1.3959e-4.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 =360 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2.

(0.1)^2=0.01, so 360 *1.551e-4 *0.01 =360 *1.551e-6 = 360 * 0.000001551 ≈5.5836e-4.

[Co(SCN)3]^−=22680 *1.551e-4 *0.001=22680 *1.551e-7.

22680 *1.551e-7 = let's compute 22680 * 1.551e-7 → 22680 * 1.551e-7 = 22680 * (1.551/1e7) )= (22680 *1.551)/1e7.

22680 *1.551: 22680 *1=22680, 22680 *0.5=11340, 22680*0.05=1134, 22680*0.001=22.68.

So 22680 +11340=34020, +1134=35154, +22.68=35176.68 → 35176.68 / 1e7=0.003517668 → 3.517668e-3 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)4]^2−=362880 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^4.

(0.1)^4=1e-4, so 362880 *1.551e-4 *1e-4 =362880 *1.551e-8.

362880 *1.551e-8 → 362880 * 1.551e-8 = (362880 *1.551) / 1e8.

Compute 362880 *1.551:

Approximate: 362880 *1.5=544320, 362880 *0.05=18144, 362880 *0.001=362.88.

So 544320 +18144=562,464 +362.88=562,826.88.

Divide by 1e8: 562826.88 / 1e8 = 0.0056282688 → 5.6282688e-3 M.

Now, let's sum all the concentrations to check if they add up to c_total=1e-2 M.

[Co²+]=1.551e-4 → 0.0001551 M

[CoSCN+]=1.3959e-4 → 0.00013959

[Co(SCN)₂]^0=5.5836e-4 →0.00055836

[Co(SCN)3]^−=3.517668e-3 →0.003517668

[Co(SCN)4]^2−=5.6282688e-3 →0.0056282688

Adding them up:

0.0001551 +0.00013959 =0.00029469

+0.00055836 →0
