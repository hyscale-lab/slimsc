Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The question gives four options: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The options are combinations of these. I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM).

Wait, so first, what are each of these symmetries? Lorentz symmetry is about how the theory looks the same under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translationsâ€”so the whole symmetry of special relativity. Then there's CP symmetry, which is charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetry together. CPT is the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal.

In the Standard Model, the SM respects all of these except for some cases. Like, C and P might be violated, but their combination CP is often conserved. But wait, in the SM, some theories violate CP, but I think the SM as a whole must respect certain symmetries.

Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory based on SM. So the operators in SMEFT must respect the symmetries of the SM. So which of these symmetries must all SMEFT operators obey?

I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. Because the SM is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is built from it. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars, or form part of a Lorentz covariant structure. So option 1 is correct.

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. But in SMEFT, the operators are nonrenormalizable, so they might have higher dimensions. Do they respect Poincare? I think yes, because the SM respects Poincare, and SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory built from SM fields. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

CP and CPT: The SM doesn't always conserve CP. For example, in the CKM mechanism, CP violation occurs. So SMEFT operators can violate CP, right? But wait, when we write SMEFT operators, do they have to be invariant under
