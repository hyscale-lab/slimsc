Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for each reaction. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's typically some kind of addition. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, cyanohydrin formation involves adding a nitrile group to a ketone. So the general reaction is ketone + CN^- under certain conditions.

I think the conditions for cyanohydrin formation involve an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism probably involves the attack of the nucleophilic CN^- on the carbonyl carbon. To make that happen, the carbonyl oxygen would be protonated, making it more electrophilic. So, what's a common acid used here? Maybe H3O+ (which is option A) or something else like H2SO4, but looking at the options, the possible A reagents are H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, what's NaHSO3 used for?

Wait, another thought: sometimes the cyanohydrin is formed using sulfuric acid as a catalyst. But NaHSO3, sodium bisulfite, is more commonly used in other reactions like the reduction of aldehydes/ketones to alcohols. Oh, but wait, no, the cyanohydrin is a direct addition, so acid is needed.

Looking back, the reaction is butanone (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would have a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon, which is the cyanohydrin. So the conditions for this are acid catalysis. So A should be H3O+ or maybe another acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ for A, while C and D have NaHSO3.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that NaHSO3 is used with CN- to form a more stable product. Or maybe it's not. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is under basic conditions, but I don't think so because the CN- is a good nucleophile but needs some activation.

Wait, another angle: the cyanohydrin formation is usually done with an acid catalyst. So the reagent A would be an acid. So the options for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. Which one is correct?

Wait, I think when you have NaCN, sometimes it's used with a strong acid like sulfuric acid, but in the presence of H+, the CN- would be the nucleophile. So perhaps the reaction uses H3O+ as reagent A, which is option A or B.

So for the first reaction, the correct A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. The product is 2-(
