Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to think through each step carefully.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with cyanide ions, like from NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. 

Wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst usually. Oh right, because the mechanism for adding CN- to a ketone typically involves protonating the carbonyl oxygen to make it more electrophilic. So the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. So that reaction would require an acid catalyst. Like H3O+ maybe. So reagent A is probably H3O+.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would have a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon, which matches the cyanohydrin formation. So A is an acid catalyst, like H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group is converting to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does that happen? Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. Oh, right. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acid conditions and heat. Or maybe using a strong base? Wait, what's the usual reagent for that?

I remember that nitriles are hydrolyzed to amides first under acidic conditions, and then the amides are further hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. Or wait, another pathway is using H2O with HCl, H2SO4, or other strong acids. Alternatively, using a base like NaOH and then acidifying.

Wait, in the presence of H2O, which is the reagent B here, but the conditions would determine the pathway. So if B is HCl, that's a strong acid. So the nitrile would hydrolyze in acidic conditions to a carboxylic acid, right?

Wait, let me think about the reagents. The second reaction is using B, which is H2O, but the reagent is HCl or another acid. Oh wait, looking back, the options say B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. So for the second reaction, using HCl as the reagent along with H2O (since B is H2O? Wait, no. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → ... Wait, no, the question says the second reagent is B, and in the reaction it's written as B (H2O). Wait, maybe I misread that. Let me check:

The second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so in the reaction, B is present, and it's H2O. So the reagent B is H2O. Or is that a typo? No, perhaps the way it's written is that the reagent is H2O, but the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, no, the way the question is written is that the second reaction uses reagent B, and the reagent in the reaction is H2O. So perhaps B is the catalyst. Oh, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So for that, the typical conditions are H2O with acid or base. For example, using H2O under acidic conditions (like H2SO4, HCl) or under basic conditions (like NaOH) followed by acid work-up.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So in acidic conditions, nitrile hydrolysis would go to carboxylic acids. So if reagent B is HCl, then with H2O, that would provide the acidic conditions needed for the nitrile to become a carboxylic acid.

So, for the second reaction, reagent B would be HCl. So looking at the options, which option has A as H3O+ and B as HCl?

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → this would fit.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → but A is supposed to be H3O+.

So option A seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. What about the other options?

If option A is correct for both reactions.

Wait, for the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So A is the acid catalyst, likely H3O+.

Second reaction, nitrile to acid, so need acid. So B is HCl.

So option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but another option is D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH. Hmm, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since it's a strong acid, HSO3- is a weak acid, but in solution, it can act as H+ and SO3^2-). But I'm not sure if NaHSO3 would be a suitable catalyst for the first reaction. The first reaction is a nucleophilic addition to ketone, which typically uses H+ like H3O+.

So which option has A as H3O+ and B as HCl? That's option A.

Alternatively, wait, let me think: The second reaction uses H2O and B as the reagent. So if B is HCl, then it's HCl and H2O. So that would make sense for the hydrolysis.

So, the conclusion is that the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


The first reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of cyanide (NaCN) to butan-2-one, a ketone, to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the cyanide ion to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the most suitable acid catalyst for this reaction.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This conversion requires acidic conditions to hydrolyze the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. HCl, a strong acid, provides the necessary acidic environment for this transformation.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile in the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable as a catalyst for the first reaction, as it is not a strong enough acid for the nucleophilic addition to the ketone.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is appropriate for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct choice is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
