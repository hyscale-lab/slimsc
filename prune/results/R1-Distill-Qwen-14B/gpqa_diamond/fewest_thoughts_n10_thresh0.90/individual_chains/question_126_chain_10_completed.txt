Okay, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me break it down step by step. So, the question involves two reactions and analyzing the products using HPLC. Hmm, I need to think about each reaction and what happens after.

First, Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It's treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It's usually used to reduce esters, carbonyl groups, etc. Hexan-3-one is a ketone. So, LAH would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. Wait, but wait, the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the ketone is on carbon 3, and there's a methoxy group on carbon 5.

So when LAH reduces the ketone, it'll add two hydrogens. The product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, the configurationâ€”since the starting material is S configuration, how does the reduction affect that? Oh, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but it's a bulky one. Wait, no, LAH is LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent and usually doesn't change the stereochemistry because it's a two-step addition (like in ketones, the hydride attacks one face, then the other). Wait, no, for ketones, the addition is in two steps, but in this case, the starting ketone is not a chiral center. Wait, the starting molecule is (S) configuration at which carbon? Let me draw the structure.

Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3, but with the methoxy on the fifth carbon. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons. So hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's 5 carbons on one side. Wait, no, hexan is six carbons. So 3-one is:

Carbon 1: CH3, Carbon 2: CH2, Carbon 3: C=O, then Carbon 4: CH2, Carbon 5: CH2, Carbon 6: CH3? No, wait that's more like 3-pentanone. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, that's actually pentan-3-one. Hmm, perhaps I should get back on track.

Wait, the compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? No. Let me write it properly.

Carbon 1: CH3, Carbon 2: CH2, Carbon 3: C=O, Carbon 4: CH-OCH3 (since it's 5-methoxy), then Carbon 5: CH2, Carbon 6: CH3? Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the structure is:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, maybe it's:

(CH2)3-C(=O)-OCH3? No, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the product instead. When you reduce the ketone, the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a CH-OH group. So, the product of Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration, but where is the chiral center?

Wait, the starting ketone is not a chiral center because it's a carbonyl. So after reduction, the carbon where the ketone was becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the carbon 3 is now -CH(OH)-. Now, is that a chiral center? Let's see: The carbon 3 has four different groups: the OH, the adjacent CH2 groups, and the other substituents. Wait, depending on the structure.

Wait, let's imagine hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. So, after reduction, the C=O becomes CH-OH. So, carbon 3 would have two CH2 groups on either side. Wait, but in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the methoxy is on carbon 5. So, the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? No, that's not correct. Let me number correctly. Hexan-3-one is:

Position 1: CH3, Position 2: CH2, Position 3: C=O, Position 4: CH2, Position 5: CH2, Position 6: CH3? But that doesn't fit with 5-methoxy. So, 5-methoxy would be on position 5, which is the fourth carbon from the C=O?

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? No, that would make the methoxy on the same carbon as the carbonyl, which would be a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the starting material is (S) configuration, so after reduction, the resulting alcohol will have a new chiral center. So in Reaction I, the product is a secondary alcohol with a chiral center. So, it would be a single enantiomer, right? So when you reduce the ketone, you get an alcohol, which is a new chiral center. But since the starting material is (S), what happens after reduction? Wait, no, the starting material is (S) configuration. But wait, the starting ketone isn't a chiral center. So, how is the (S) designation given? Wait, maybe the starting material has a chiral center elsewhere. Oh! Wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the methoxy is on carbon 5. So, perhaps the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3, Carbon 2: CH2, Carbon 3: C=O, Carbon 4: CH2, Carbon 5: CH-OCH3, Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, so the structure would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

The compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is arranged as:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. So, the carbonyl is on C3, and the methoxy is on C5.

Wait, when reduced, the C=O becomes a CH-OH. So, the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, the configuration at C3 would now be a chiral center. Wait, because when you reduce a ketone, the carbon becomes a secondary alcohol, which is a chiral center if it has four different groups.

So, the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, (S) or (R) configuration? Wait, the starting material was (S) at which carbon? Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. That suggests that the methoxy is on C5, and the ketone is on C3. But since the ketone is on C3, which is a carbonyl, it's not a chiral center. So, the (S) designation must be on another carbon. Wait, perhaps the molecule has another chiral center elsewhere. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is not chiral, so the product is a single chiral center, but maybe the configuration is determined by the reduction. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but in ketone reductions, it typically leads to a racemic mixture because the hydride attack can come from either face. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which indicates a chiral center elsewhere. Because the ketone itself isn't a chiral center. So, perhaps the methoxy is on a chiral center, or perhaps another group is.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the methoxy is on C5, which is a chiral center. Let's imagine the structure: the molecule is (S) configuration at C5, which has a methoxy group. So, the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: C-OCH3 (with other substituents)
Carbon 6: CH3

Wait, but for C5 to be a chiral center, it needs four different groups. So, perhaps the groups are: CH2 (from C4), OCH3, two different CH2 groups from either side? Hmm, I'm not getting it. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center at C3, but no, C3 is a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's move on to Reaction II and come back.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups: O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH3. Wait, no, pentane is five carbons. So, it's (CH2) groups between two ketones. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's more like hexane. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, no, wait. Let me count: 2 and 4 positions in a 5-carbon chain. So, positions 1,2,3,4,5. So, the structure is CH2(CO)CH2(CO)CH2. Wait, no, that's more like 3 positions. Wait, no, maybe it's:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? That would be 5 carbons: positions 1 (O=C), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (CO), 5 (CH3). So, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)C(O)-CH2-C(O)CH3? No, wait, that can't be because the carbons would be 1: (CH3)C(O), 2: CH2, 3: C(O)CH3. So, that's 3 carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's:

The molecule is O=C-C-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, the two ketone groups are on carbons 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain. So, the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, it's 2,4-dione.

Now, when you treat this with NaBH4. NaBH4 is a milder reducing agent, but it can reduce ketones. However, in the presence of two ketone groups, how does it proceed? With excess NaBH4, perhaps both ketones are reduced.

Each ketone would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, the product would be HOCH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Each ketone group (C=O) is converted to CH(OH). So, pentane-2,4-dione would become HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me see:

Original structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

After reduction, each C=O becomes -CH(OH)-. So, the product would be CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, that's pentane-2,4-diol. But wait, pentane-2,4-diol has two secondary alcohol groups on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, the positions are 2 and 4, so they are not adjacent. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, the original is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. After reduction, becomes CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but each ketone is at positions 2 and 4. So, the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, which is 2,4-pentanediol. Now, this molecule has two secondary alcohol groups, each on a chiral center.

Wait, each of those alcohols is on a carbon (carbons 2 and 4) which are connected to four different groups. Let me think. Carbon 2: attached to CH3 (from C1), CH(OH) (from C2), CH2 (from C3), and the rest? Let me see.

In 2,4-pentanediol, each of the secondary alcohols is on a chiral center. So, each has four different groups: for carbon 2, the groups are:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH (as part of the alcohol),
- CH2OH (from C3, which is connected to C4-OH),
- and another CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure: the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, carbon 2: CH(OH), attached to:

- carbon 1: CH3,
- carbon 3: CH2,
- OH,
- and the other substituent is a hydrogen? Wait, no, because carbon 2 is CH(OH) with three substituents. Wait, no: each carbon in a chain is attached to two other carbons and two other groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to see that each of the two secondary alcohols (at C2 and C4) are on symmetric positions in the molecule. So, the molecule is symmetric around the central carbon (C3). So, when you reduce both ketones, the product is a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, the configurations at C2 and C4 would be opposite, leading to an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral overall.

Wait, that's an important point. Let me think: the starting material is 2,4-dione, which is symmetric. Upon reduction, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is also symmetric. So, the molecule is a meso compound, meaning it's not chiral because of the internal plane of symmetry. So, even though each of the two alcohols is on a chiral center, the overall molecule is achiral because of the symmetry.

So, in Reaction II, the product is a meso compound with two stereocenters but no net chirality. So, it's a single compound.

Now, combining the products of both reactions. Reaction I gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (assuming the starting material's (S) designation leads to a specific configuration after reduction, but I'm not exactly sure about that, but perhaps it's a racemic mixture?), but wait, in general, LAH would reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But since the starting ketone is not a chiral center, the product would be a racemic mixture, but wait, the starting material was chiral, so perhaps the product is a single enantiomer.

Wait, the starting material was (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone isn't a chiral center, but perhaps the methoxy group is on a chiral center. Hmm, maybe I should think about that again.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the products. Reaction I produces a secondary alcohol, which is a chiral center. If the starting material is chiral, then the product would be a single enantiomer. So, from Reaction I, we have one product: a single chiral molecule.

Reaction II produces a meso compound, which is a single compound with two stereocenters but no net chirality.

So, when the products from both reactions are combined, how many compounds do we have? The products are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single enantiomer, one compound)
2. 2,4-pentanediol meso compound (single compound)

Wait, but wait. No, wait. Wait, in Reaction I, when reducing the ketone, the product would have a new stereocenter. LAH, when reducing ketones, typically gives a racemic mixture because the hydride can attack from either face, leading to both R and S configurations. So, the product would be a racemic mixture, meaning two enantiomers.

But wait, the starting material was (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Wait, but that would mean that the starting compound is chiral, so perhaps the configuration of the new stereocenter is determined in a way that depends on the starting configuration.

Wait, that's a bit more complicated. Let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the ketone is on C3, and the methoxy is on C5. Let's imagine the structure as:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? No, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that would make the ketone on C3 and a substituent on C4. So, when the ketone is reduced, the C=O becomes CH-OH, and the adjacent carbon (C4) has the OCH3 group.

Wait, but let's think about the configuration. The starting material is (S) configuration. So, perhaps the carbon where the methoxy is attached (C5?) is a chiral center. So, in the starting material, C5 is a chiral center with groups: OCH3, CH2 from C4, and two other substituents.

But when you reduce the ketone (C3), the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has a new chiral center at C3. Wait, but the starting material's chiral center is at C5, so the product would have a new chiral center at C3 and the existing chiral center at C5. But wait, that's not correct because the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which I'm not sure if C5 is a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material only has one chiral center, which is at C5 (the OCH3-bearing carbon). So, when you reduce the ketone at C3, you generate a new chiral center at C3. So, the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers: at C3 and C5.

Wait, no. Because LAH reduces the ketone to an alcohol, which introduces a new chiral center. So, the product would have a new chiral center at C3, and perhaps the C5 remains as it was, but I'm not sure if C5 is a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the C5 in the starting material is not a chiral center, so the product would have a new chiral center at C3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Assuming that after Reaction I, the product is a secondary alcohol with a new chiral center, and the product is a racemic mixture because the reduction of the ketone leads to both R and S configurations. So, the product would be two enantiomers.

But the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, perhaps the configuration of the new chiral center is influenced by the existing configuration. Wait, no, because the reduction is a new process that creates the stereocenter. So, LAH would attack from either face, leading to a racemic mixture, regardless of the starting material's configuration elsewhere.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is chiral, but the ketone isn't. So, the product will have two chiral centers: the existing one (from the starting material) and the new one from the reduction. Or perhaps not. Maybe the product only has one new chiral center, and the other carbon isn't chiral.

I think I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that Reaction I produces a racemic mixture, leading to two enantiomers, and Reaction II produces a single meso compound.

Wait, but the starting material is chiral. So, perhaps the product's configuration is influenced by the starting material. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration doesn't influence the new stereocenter because the reduction is a new process. So, the product would be a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. So, after Reaction I, we have two enantiomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but the starting material is (S), but the product's new chiral center is at C3, which was a ketone (non-chiral). So, after reduction, the product would be a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) at C3, but the existing chiral center (if any) remains as it was.

Wait, but perhaps the starting material only has one chiral center, so the product would have two chiral centers, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer. Wait, but in reality, LAH would reduce the ketone to form a secondary alcohol, and since the starting material isn't a chiral center at the ketone, the reduction would lead to a racemic mixture. So, two enantiomers.

But I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should move on and see what the options are.

Now, after both reactions, the products are combined. So, the products are:

- From Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is either a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture (two enantiomers)
- From Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol (meso compound), which is a single compound

So, let's say Reaction I gives a racemic mixture, meaning two enantiomers. So, in total, there are 2 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 3 compounds.

Wait, but wait. If Reaction I produces a racemic mixture, it's actually two enantiomers of the same compound. So, when you combine the products from both reactions, you have three different compounds: two enantiomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and the meso compound.

Wait, no. Because the two enantiomers are enantiomers of each other, so they are distinct but related. So, in terms of the number of peaks in HPLC, each enantiomer would give a separate peak in a chiral column but would co-elute in a normal-phase column.

Wait, the question is about the number of peaks observed in both HPLC methods. So, normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity, while a chiral column separates enantiomers.

So, for the combined products:

- From Reaction I: two enantiomers (if racemic) or one compound (if single enantiomer)
- From Reaction II: a single meso compound

So, let's consider the possibilities.

Scenario 1: Reaction I produces a racemic mixture (two enantiomers) and Reaction II produces a single compound.

Total compounds: 2 + 1 = 3.

In normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't separate enantiomers, the two enantiomers would co-elute. So, the normal-phase would show two peaks: one for the racemic mixture (they're the same compound, just mirror images) and one for the meso compound.

Wait, no. Wait, in normal-phase HPLC, the two enantiomers would have the same retention time because they're the same compound (same molecular structure, just opposite configurations). So, they'd co-elute as a single peak. So, in normal-phase, the peaks would be:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (racemic, one peak)
- 2,4-pentanediol (one peak)

So, two peaks in normal-phase.

In chiral HPLC, which separates enantiomers, the racemic mixture would give two peaks, and the meso compound would give one peak because it's not chiral (it's a meso compound, so it doesn't have enantiomers). So, in chiral HPLC: 2 (from racemic) +1 (meso) = 3 peaks.

So, the total would be 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

Looking at the options, option B is 3 in chiral and 2 in normal. Option D is 3 in both. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the meso compound is a single compound, so in normal-phase, it would be one peak. The racemic mixture (from Reaction I) would produce two enantiomers, which in normal-phase HPLC would co-elute as one peak. So, total in normal-phase: 2 peaks.

In chiral HPLC, racemic would give two peaks, and the meso gives one, so total 3 peaks.

So, the answer would be 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase. So, that's option B.

But wait, let me think again. Reaction I: starting with a chiral ketone. So, perhaps the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer, not a racemic mixture. Because the starting material is chiral, and the reduction might have some influence on the configuration. Wait, but reduction of ketones typically leads to racemic mixtures because the hydride can attack from either face. So, unless the starting material's configuration induces some kind of facial bias, which I don't think is the case here.

So, likely, Reaction I gives a racemic mixture, leading to two enantiomers. So, 2 peaks in chiral HPLC and 1 in normal-phase for Reaction I's product. Reaction II's product is a single compound (meso), so 1 peak in both HPLC methods.

So, combining, in normal-phase: 2 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 3? No, wait, no. Because in normal-phase, the two enantiomers from I would co-elute as one peak. So, total in normal-phase: 1 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 2.

In chiral HPLC: 2 (from I) + 1 (from II) = 3.

So, the answer would be 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase. Looking at the options, option B is 3 and 2, respectively.

Wait, but let me make sure. The product from Reaction I is a secondary alcohol, which is a new chiral center. So, the product is a racemic mixture, meaning two enantiomers. So, in the combined product, you have:

- Two enantiomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
- One meso compound of 2,4-pentanediol

So, total in normal-phase HPLC: two (from I) would co-elute as one, and the meso as another. So, 2 peaks.

In chiral HPLC: each enantiomer is separated, so two peaks from I, and one from II. So, 3 peaks.

So, the answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.


The question involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. Here's the breakdown:

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagent**: LAH (a strong reducing agent).
- **Process**: The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, forming (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
- **Key Point**: LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, and this reduction introduces a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is chiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (R)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione.
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 (a reducing agent).
- **Process**: Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol.
- **Key Point**: The product is a meso compound because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral overall despite having two stereocenters.

### Combined Products:
1. **From Reaction I**: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (R)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
2. **From Reaction II**: A single meso compound: 2,4-pentanediol.

### Analysis in HPLC:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Enantiomers co-elute because normal-phase HPLC does not separate stereoisomers.
   - The racemic mixture from Reaction I appears as a single peak.
   - The meso compound from Reaction II appears as a separate peak.
   - **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Enantiomers are separated, so the racemic mixture from Reaction I produces two distinct peaks.
   - The meso compound does not have enantiomers and appears as a single peak.
   - **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC**: 3.

### Final Answer:
- **Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 peaks.
- **Chiral HPLC**: 3 peaks.

**Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

ANSWER: B
