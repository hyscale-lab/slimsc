Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to vector calculus, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, right. So, the integral is ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV over the volume of the sphere. I remember that the divergence theorem relates this volume integral to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary of the volume. The divergence theorem states that ∫∫∫ (∇·F) dV = ∫∫ F·dA over the surface. So maybe I can apply that here.

Wait, but before jumping to that, maybe I should first compute the divergence of f(r) in spherical coordinates because the field is radial. Oh right, because in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that's purely radial (only the r-component) is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r), where A_r is the radial component of the vector field.

So in this case, the vector field f(r) has only the radial component, which is f(r) = 1/r². So A_r = 1/r².

So let's compute the divergence:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) 

Wait, simplifying the expression inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = zero?

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, then the integral over any volume that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But if the sphere includes the origin, perhaps there's a delta function or something involved.

Wait, another approach: considering this vector field. If f(r) = 1/r² in the radial direction, then this is similar to an electric field produced by a point charge, but wait, no, wait. For electric fields, E is proportional to 1/r², but the divergence depends on the charge enclosed, right?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For a vector field F(r) = (F_r) e_r, the divergence in spherical coordinates is:

∇·F = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r) + (other terms for angular components, but F has only F_r, so those are zero). So yeah, it's (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

In our case, F_r is 1/r². So plugging in:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]
= (1/r²) d/dr (1)
= (1/r²) * 0
= 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0. Because at r=0, the field might not be defined. So, the divergence is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin.

But wait, when you have a vector field that behaves like 1/r², such as the electric field of a point charge, the divergence is non-zero only at the origin because that's where the charge is. So maybe in this problem, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it might have a delta function or something.

Wait, but how does that work with the divergence formula? Let me compute it more carefully.

So F_r = 1/r².

So ∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * F_r) 
= (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]
= (1/r²) d/dr (1) 
= 0.

But wait, that's if we treat F_r as 1/r² everywhere. However, this is problematic because when r=0, the field is not defined. So perhaps this is a case where the divergence is zero except at the origin, where it's a delta function.

Alternatively, perhaps this vector field is the gradient of a scalar function? Wait, no—because the gradient in spherical coordinates would have components involving 1/r terms, but not 1/r², I think. Alternatively, maybe it's the gradient of 1/r, because the gradient of 1/r is - (1/r²) e_r, but that's a different story.

Wait, but the divergence we calculated is zero except possibly at r=0. So, if we integrate the divergence over any volume that doesn't include the origin, the integral would be zero. But if the volume does include the origin, like in this case, because the sphere is centered at the origin with radius R, then R is positive, so the origin is included.

But wait, according to the calculation, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So the integral of the divergence over the entire sphere would be zero, because the divergence is zero everywhere except at a single point, and in integration, a single point doesn't contribute to the volume integral.

Wait, but that can't be right because if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the integral would be zero, but wait, I remember from Maxwell's equations that the divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0, which for a point charge is a delta function at the origin. So perhaps the divergence here is a delta function scaled by a factor.

Wait, let me think again. Let's take the vector field F(r) = (1/r²) e_r. What is its divergence?

Hmm, let's compute it using the formula. The divergence in spherical coordinates is:

∇·F = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r) + (other terms for angular components, which are zero here).

So F_r is 1/r², so:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr ( r² * (1/r²) ) 
= (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

Wait, so that suggests the divergence is zero everywhere except r=0, but wait, perhaps when r approaches zero, the field behaves in a way that the divergence is a delta function.

Alternatively, perhaps the field is not defined at r=0, but when you integrate the divergence over a volume that includes r=0, you get a non-zero value.

Wait, another approach: using the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem says that the integral of ∇·F over a volume is equal to the flux of F through the surface enclosing that volume.

So, in this problem, the volume is a sphere of radius R. So the flux through the surface (sphere of radius R) would be ∫ F · dA.

But F is radial, so F · dA is F_r * dA, where dA is the area element on the sphere.

So F_r at radius R is F(R) = 1/(R²). The surface area of the sphere is 4 π R². So the flux is F(R) * 4 π R² = (1/R²) * 4 π R² = 4 π.

So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·F over the sphere is equal to the flux, which is 4 π.

But wait, earlier when I computed the divergence, I found it to be zero, so the integral would be zero. There's a contradiction here. So which one is correct?

Ah, perhaps because the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So when integrating ∇·F over the entire sphere, which includes r=0, the divergence's integral is 4 π, while elsewhere it's zero.

Wait, but that would suggest that ∇·F is zero except at the origin, where it's a delta function scaled such that the integral over any volume containing the origin is 4 π.

Wait, but let's compute the flux again. The flux is 4 π, so according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·F over the sphere would be 4 π. But earlier, when we calculated ∇·F, it came out zero, which suggests that the integral should be zero. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the divergence. Let me double-check.

F_r = 1/r².

Compute ∇·F = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r).

r² F_r is r² * (1/r²) = 1.

d/dr (1) = 0.

So ∇·F = 0. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0.

But according to the divergence theorem, the flux through the sphere is 4 π, so the volume integral must be 4 π. But according to the divergence calculated, the integral is zero. So where is the mistake here?

Ah, I think I get it now. There's a mistake in assuming that F is defined everywhere inside the sphere. If F(r) is 1/r², then at r=0, the field is undefined, which suggests that the function isn't smooth there. So the divergence theorem applies to regions where the vector field is differentiable. Therefore, perhaps when we compute the divergence, it's zero everywhere except at the origin, but the integral over the sphere includes the origin, which contributes to the integral.

Wait, but how does that work? Because in the calculation, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So the integral of the divergence is just the value at r=0 multiplied by the volume... but no, because the divergence isn't zero elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider the vector field F(r) = (1/r²) e_r. Let's compute the flux through a sphere of radius R.

Flux Φ = ∫ F · dA = ∫ F_r(R) * dA over the sphere. F_r(R) is 1/R², and dA is R² sinθ dθ dφ. So the integral becomes 1/R² * 4 π R² = 4 π.

So flux is 4 π. Now, according to the divergence theorem, the flux equals the integral of ∇·F over the volume. So if the flux is 4 π, then the volume integral must be 4 π.

But according to the divergence calculation, ∇·F is zero everywhere except at r=0, because we found ∇·F = 0, but wait, that's only when the function is smooth. But perhaps because the function is singular at r=0, the divergence isn't zero. So maybe the divergence is not zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the divergence calculation. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, the vector field F(r) = (1/r²) e_r. The divergence in spherical coordinates is:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dr (F_θ sinθ) ) + other terms for φ, but F_θ and F_φ are zero.

So ∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) 
= (1/r²) d/dr (1) 
= 0.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So the divergence is zero, but then the flux would have to be zero, which contradicts the flux calculation.

Hmm, so perhaps there's an error in the way I'm applying the divergence theorem. Maybe the divergence theorem isn't directly applicable here because the vector field isn't differentiable at the origin.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector field is actually the gradient of something, which would make its divergence non-zero. For example, the gradient of 1/r is - (1/r²) e_r, so F(r) = grad(1/r) = - (1/r²) e_r.

Wait, then what's the divergence of F(r) if F(r) = grad(1/r)?

Wait, F(r) = - (1/r²) e_r.

The divergence would be:

∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r )

F_r is -1/r².

So:

(1/r²) d/dr (r² * (-1/r²) ) 
= (1/r²) d/dr ( -1 ) 
= (1/r²)*0 = 0.

Hmm, that's the same result as before. But for the electric field, which is similar, the divergence is rho/epsilon_0, which for a point charge is a delta function.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. The divergence in this case is zero except at r=0, but the flux is non-zero, which would imply that there's a delta function at the origin.

So, the integral of ∇·F over the volume is 4 π, but ∇·F is zero except at r=0, where it's a delta function scaled to give that integral.

Wait, but how does that fit with the divergence theorem? Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except at a point, the integral would be the same as the flux through the surface, which is 4 π.

So, the volume integral is 4 π.

So, looking back at the problem, the question asks for the volume integral of ∇·f inside the sphere of radius R. So the answer would be 4 π.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A) 4 π
Option B) 1
Option C) 4/3 π R
Option D) 0

So the correct answer would be A) 4 π.

Wait, but wait, but earlier I thought the divergence was zero, which would imply the integral is zero. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps because in reality, the divergence is not zero. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the divergence calculation.

Wait, let's consider another perspective. Let me represent the vector field in terms of the gradient of a scalar function.

Suppose f(r) is the gradient of some scalar function φ(r). Then, the divergence of f would be the Laplacian of φ.

Wait, but what's the scalar function whose gradient gives f(r) = (1/r²) e_r?

Well, the gradient in spherical coordinates is (dφ/dr) e_r + ... So if f(r) is (1/r²) e_r, then the scalar function φ must satisfy dφ/dr = 1/r². Integrate that: φ(r) = -1/r + C, where C is a constant. So the gradient of φ is (1/r²) e_r, which is f(r).

So, ∇·f = ∇·(∇φ) = ∇² φ.

Now, the Laplacian of φ is ∇² φ.

Compute ∇² φ, where φ = -1/r.

The Laplacian in spherical coordinates for a function that depends only on r is:

∇² φ = (1/r²) d/dr (r² dφ/dr )

dφ/dr = 1/r².

So,

(1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] 
= (1/r²) d/dr (1)
= 0.

So ∇² φ = 0, which implies that ∇·f = 0.

But earlier, using the divergence theorem, we found the volume integral to be 4 π.

This suggests that the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function scaled such that the integral over any volume containing r=0 is 4 π.

So, when we integrate ∇·f over the volume of the sphere of radius R (assuming R > 0), the integral would be 4 π, because the divergence includes a delta function at the origin.

But wait, wait—if we have a function which is smooth everywhere except at the origin, the divergence is zero, but the integral is 4 π because of the delta function. So the integral of ∇·f is 4 π, regardless of the divergence being zero elsewhere.

So the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere is 4 π, which matches option A.

So the answer is A) 4 π.


The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin. The vector field has a radial component \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \) and no angular components. The divergence of the field is computed in spherical coordinates, and the divergence theorem is used to relate the volume integral to the flux through the surface of the sphere.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Divergence of the Vector Field**:  
   The divergence of a radial vector field \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) = F_r(\mathbf{r}) \hat{e}_r \) in spherical coordinates is given by:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F_r \right).
   \]
   Substituting \( F_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we find:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
   \]
   Thus, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field is singular.

2. **Flux Through the Surface**:  
   Using the divergence theorem, the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere of radius \( R \) is equal to the flux of \( \mathbf{f} \) through the surface of the sphere:
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A}.
   \]
   The flux is computed as:
   \[
   \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_S F_r(R) \, dA = \int_S \frac{1}{R^2} \, dA.
   \]
   The surface area of the sphere is \( 4\pi R^2 \), so:
   \[
   \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
   \]

3. **Integral of the Divergence**:  
   While \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 0 \) everywhere except at the origin, the singularity at \( r = 0 \) contributes to the integral. The divergence theorem confirms that the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere is equal to the flux through the surface, which is \( 4\pi \).

### Conclusion:
The volume integral of the divergence of the vector field inside the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \). This corresponds to **Option A**.
