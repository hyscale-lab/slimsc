Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors can be tricky, especially when dealing with spin operators. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, wait. So the operator P is probably the spin operator, right? Because spin operators have components like Sx, Sy, Sz, and they're proportional to Pauli matrices. Oh, but wait, the problem says P, but the structure seems familiar to spin-1/2 systems.

So, the general spin operator in an arbitrary direction n is given by the vector product of the Pauli matrices and the direction vector. The operator P would be something like P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z), but wait, considering that n is in the x-z plane, that means n_y is zero. So the operator simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the direction vector n is arbitrary but lying in the x-z plane. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that, right? Because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane implies that the angle phi is 0 or 180, but the direction θ is measured from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but since it's in x-z, φ is 0 or π, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if φ is 0, or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ) if φ is π. But maybe the exact values of θ and φ aren't needed here because the eigenvector would depend on the direction.

But wait, the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator P is n · σ multiplied by ħ/2, perhaps. But the question is about the eigenvector when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, the spin-up state along any direction n will be an eigenvector of the operator S · n with eigenvalue ħ/2. So that's the state we're looking for.

So, the eigenvector should represent the spin-up state along the direction n. But how do I find the components of this eigenvector?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct the operator P in terms of the components given and then find its eigenvectors. Let's see.

Wait, the components are given as:

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the operator P for an arbitrary direction n = (nx, 0, nz) in the x-z plane would be:

P = nx * P_x + nz * P_z

Because ny=0, so the Py term drops out.

So, substituting the matrices:

P = (nx * ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (nz * ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix. Let's factor out ħ/2.

P = (ħ/2) [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So, the matrix inside would be:

First row: [ nz * 1 , nx * 1 ]
Second row: [ nx * 1 , nz * (-1) ]

So the matrix is:

[ nz   nx ]
[ nx  -nz ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix with elements [nz, nx; nx, -nz], multiplied by ħ/2.

So, to find the eigenvector, we need to solve the eigenvalue equation P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me write that out. The matrix P is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]. So, subtracting (ħ/2) I:

P - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] - (ħ/2) [[1,0], [0,1]]

= (ħ/2) [ [nz -1, nx], [nx, -nz -1 ] ]

So, this matrix must multiply the eigenvector [a; b] and give zero.

So, the equations are:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0
nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Wait, but we can multiply both equations by 2/ħ to make it easier. Let's set ħ=1 for simplicity in this calculation.

So, the equations become:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0
nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Hmm. Let's write this as a system:

Equation 1: (nz -1) a + nx b = 0
Equation 2: nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

We can treat this as a homogeneous system, so the determinant of the coefficients must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Wait, but since it's an eigenvalue equation, the determinant is the characteristic equation. Oh wait, but since I'm looking for the eigenvectors, the equations must be consistent.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to look for a non-trivial solution (a, b not both zero). So, from equation 1: (nz-1) a = -nx b → a = [ -nx/(nz-1) ] b

Similarly, equation 2: nx a = (nz +1) b → a = [ (nz +1)/nx ] b

So setting the two expressions for a equal:

- nx/(nz-1) = (nz +1)/nx

Multiply both sides by (nz -1) * nx:

- (nx)^2 = (nz +1)(nz -1)

Which simplifies to:

- (nx)^2 = (nz^2 -1 )

Rearranging:

nz^2 -1 = - (nx)^2 → nz^2 + (nx)^2 =1

Which makes sense because the direction vector n must be a unit vector, so nx^2 + nz^2 =1. So this equation is automatically satisfied, meaning the two expressions are consistent, and we can proceed.

So, from equation 1, a = [ -nx/(nz -1) ] b

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a; b ] = b [ -nx/(nz-1); 1 ]

But wait, perhaps I can express this in terms of θ, since the direction is in the x-z plane. Let me parametrize the direction. Let me say that the direction vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, that would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), whose magnitude is sqrt(sin²θ + cos²θ) =1. So, the direction is along (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Therefore, nx = sinθ, and nz = cosθ.

Wait, but wait: when θ is the polar angle, nz is cosθ, and the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since we're in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so nx = sinθ.

So, substituting nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So, our expression for a becomes:

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ a; b ] = [ - sinθ/(cosθ -1) * b; b ]

We can factor out b and write it as:

b [ - sinθ/(cosθ -1), 1 ]

But we can also factor out a negative sign from the denominator:

cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ), so:

a = [ - sinθ / ( - (1 - cosθ) ) ] b = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b

So, a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b

Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this expression. Let me think about trigonometric identities.

I remember that (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / ( 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] b = [ cos(θ/2)/( sin(θ/2) ) ] b = cot(θ/2) b

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b

So, the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2). So, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ a; b ] = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize. So, the length squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(theta/2)|^2 |b|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 [ cot²(theta/2) + 1 ]

But cot² +1 = csc², so:

|b|^2 * csc²(theta/2) = 1 → |b|^2 = sin²(theta/2)

Thus, b = sin(theta/2) e^{i phi}, but wait, in the problem, the eigenvector is for a spin-1/2 particle, so the state is a two-component vector. Since the problem doesn't specify phase, perhaps we can set b as sin(theta/2) and a as cos(theta/2), perhaps.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because a = cot(theta/2) * b, and cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2). So, a = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * b.

If we set b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2). So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, let's confirm. Because earlier, the eigenvector came out as a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b, which after substitution became a = cot(theta/2) * b, which is the same as cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) * b.

So if we set b = sin(theta/2
