Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit. Its transit impact parameter is 0.2, and it's around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, the second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii and is also in a circular orbit, same orbital plane as the first planet. The question is asking for the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation events are observed. The options are A to D, with some numbers.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for a planet to transit its star, the orbital plane must be aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of stellar radii) between the center of the star and the center of the planet's path during transit. So a lower impact parameter means a closer approach, which increases the chance of a transit.

The first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2. So the star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun's. Sun's radius is about 1 million km, so the star's radius is 1.5 million km. But maybe I don't need exact values here; perhaps ratios will work.

The first planet's orbital period is 3 days. I need to find the maximum period for the second planet where both transit and occultation happen.

Wait, what's occultation? Oh right, that's when the planet passes behind the star from our perspective. So for both events to occur, the orbital period must allow both transits (in front) and occultations (behind). 

Wait, but the orbital period is the time it takes for the planet to orbit once. For both events to occur, the orbital period must be such that the planet can align in front and behind the star at different points in its orbit. Or does it mean that during its orbit, it can both transit and be occulted?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the orbital periods. Both planets are in circular orbits around the same star, same orbital plane. So their orbital periods will determine their relative motion.

Wait, but the question is about the second planet's maximum period where both transit and occultation events can occur. So, when can the second planet transit and be occulted?

Wait, let me think about the geometry. For a transit to happen, the planet must pass in front of the star. For an occultation, the planet must pass behind the star. So the planet's orbit must be such that from our point of view, it's sometimes in front and sometimes behind.

But the star is much bigger than the planet. The key is the orbital configuration. The orbital period of the second planet must be such that it's in a position to transit and occultate.

Wait, but wait. The first planet's transit has an impact parameter of 0.2. So the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun, which is about 1.5 * 700,000 km (approx), so 1.05 million km. The first planet's
