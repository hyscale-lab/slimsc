Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty for E2. 

Wait, but what's the total uncertainty in the energy difference between E1 and E2? Hmm, I think when considering the energy difference, it's the uncertainty in each state that contributes. So the total uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, because for each state, their energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. Or maybe I should think about the uncertainty in the difference, which would be the maximum of the two uncertainties—wait, no, because the energy difference is E2 - E1. So the uncertainty would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), assuming they're independent. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Because if ΔE is larger than the combined uncertainty, then the states can be resolved. So, if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, you can tell the two are different.

Wait, actually, the usual way to think about energy resolution is that two states are distinguishable if their energies are separated by more than the energy uncertainty, which is the minimum detectable difference. So in this case, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because if their energy difference is smaller than the combined uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

But wait, the lifetimes given are for each state, so the uncertainty in each E is based on each state's lifetime. So the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 and in E2 is ΔE2. But when considering the difference E2 - E1, the uncertainty would be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²). Because the difference is the difference between two variables, each with their own uncertainties. Oh, right! The variance of the difference is the sum of variances if they're independent.

So, the uncertainty in the difference ΔE_diff = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). Let me compute that. From earlier, ΔE1 is about 6.56e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.56e-8 eV. So their squares would be (6.56e-7)^2 = ~4.3e-13, and (6.56e-8)^2 = ~4.3e-15. Adding these together gives roughly 4.3043e-13. The square root of that is about 6.56e-7 eV. Wait, that's because ΔE2 is an order of magnitude smaller than ΔE1. So the dominant term is ΔE1.

Therefore, the combined uncertainty in the energy difference is approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than this uncertainty to be distinguishable. 

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV ≈ 0.001 e-6 eV → much smaller than 6.56e-7 eV. So 1e-9 is way smaller than 6.56e-7. So this won't do. Can't distinguish.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. So no, same issue.

C) 1e-4 eV → which is 1e-4 eV. That's 1e-4 versus 6.56e-7. So 1e-4 is much larger, so the energy difference is much bigger than the uncertainty. So this would be clearly distinguishable. 

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is smaller than 6.56e-7. 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is about 0.15 times the uncertainty. So it's not enough. So option C is the only one that's way above the required uncertainty.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations. Let me recompute the uncertainties.

For E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / 1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → so 1.05457e-25 / 1.602e-19 = approximately (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.658 * 1e-6 → 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, E2's τ is 1e-8 s → ΔE2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (1.05 / 1.602) * 1e-7 → approx 0.655e-7 → 6.55e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainties are 6.58e-7 and 6.55e-8 eV.

The uncertainty in the difference ΔE_diff = sqrt( (6.58e-7)^2 + (6.55e-8)^2 ) → since 6.5e-8 is about 1/10th of 6.5e-7, the square of the second term is negligible. So ΔE_diff ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be larger than this value. Let's look at the options again:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → much smaller than 6.58e-7 → can't resolve.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller → no.

C) 1e-4 → 1e-4 is much larger, so yes.

D) 1e-8 → 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is 0.016 times 6.58e-7. So about 1.6% of the uncertainty. Not enough.

So the correct option is C) 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

For \( E_1 \), with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), the energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \), with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} \) between \( E_2 \) and \( E_1 \) is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} = \sqrt{(6.56 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (6.56 \times 10^{-8})^2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E_2 \) is an order of magnitude smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), the dominant term is \( \Delta E_1 \), so:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy difference is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** Similarly, \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller, so the energy difference is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy difference is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the energy difference is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.

Answer: C
