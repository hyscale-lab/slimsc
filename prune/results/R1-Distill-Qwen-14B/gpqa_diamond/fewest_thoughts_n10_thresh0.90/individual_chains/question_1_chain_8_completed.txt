Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty relation. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for this purpose, it's the order of magnitude that matters.

So the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. But wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if I have a certain uncertainty in time, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional. But in this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. So the lifetimes would relate to the uncertainty in time, right? Because the lifetime is the time during which the system is in that state, and the uncertainty in energy would be the minimum resolution needed to distinguish the two states.

Wait, so the problem is about being able to clearly distinguish two energy levels. That means the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states might appear the same due to the uncertainty.

So each state has its own lifetime. Which one do I use? The lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Hmm, the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) would have a larger energy uncertainty because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt. So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 would be about ħ/(1e-9). For E2, Δt is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is about ħ/(1e-8). But wait, since E2 has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller. So to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the actual energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each state's energy is uncertain within a range. For E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and for E2, it's ΔE2. To clearly distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than that sum, the two might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy is uncertain, but the separation between them needs to be bigger than the individual spreads. Hmm. Let me think about it. Suppose ΔE1 and ΔE2 are the uncertainties for E1 and E2. Then, the energy difference ΔE (E2 - E1) must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to be resolvable. Because if the separation is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, the two states won't overlap. But I'm not exactly certain if it's the sum or just one of them. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation to see.

So, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let's plug in the values for each state.

For E1, Δt = 1e-9 s:
ΔE1 = ħ / (2Δt) → Wait, the uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. So let's compute that.

ΔE1 = ħ/(1e-9) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Wait, but the options are given in eV. So I need to convert this to electron volts. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 in eV is (1.05457e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. That can't be right because 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 is 1.05e-25 J. 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 → let me compute that. 1e-25 / 1e-19 is 1e-6. So 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.56e-7 eV. So about 0.658 microeV or 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, Δt is 1e-8 s, so:

ΔE2 = ħ/(1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.56e-8 eV, which is 0.658 nano-eV.

Wait, but wait a second. The energy difference between E2 and E1 has to be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. So ΔE (E2 - E1) > (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

Wait, but let me think again. The energy levels E1 and E2 are each uncertain within their own ranges. So E1 is approximately E1 ± ΔE1, E2 is approximately E2 ± ΔE2. So for them not to overlap, the minimal separation should be at least the sum of the uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than ΔE1 + ΔE2, then the ranges might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Let's compute that.

ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 = 6.58e-8 eV. So sum is approx 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A:1e-9 eV → 0.001 nano-eV. That's way too small.

Option B:1e-11 eV → 0.01 pico-eV. Also way too small.

Option C:1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7e-7 eV. So that's way bigger than needed.

Option D:1e-8 eV → 0.01 nano-eV. Also too small.

Wait, but wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because the question is about the energy difference needed for them to be clearly distinguishable. So perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if one uncertainty is much larger than the other, maybe the sum is not necessary.

But in our calculation, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. So ΔE1 is about 10 times larger than ΔE2. So the sum would be about 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be bigger than that.

Looking at the options, the only option larger than 7e-7 eV is option C, which is 1e-4 eV (which is 1e-4, much bigger than 7e-7). So that would be sufficient.

Wait, but the other options are way smaller, so why is option C the only one exceeding the required 7e-7 eV?

Yes, the required ΔE is about 7e-7 eV, so the energy difference should be larger than that. Only option C is larger. So the correct answer would be option C:1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me recheck my calculations. Because I'm seeing that the energy difference needed is around 7e-7 eV, and option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 times larger. That would definitely satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy uncertainty. Let me recompute.

Let me recalculate the energy uncertainty for E1:

Δt = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE = ħ / (2Δt). Wait, is the factor 1 or 2? I think the uncertainty principle is written as ΔE * Δt >= ħ/2, so the minimum uncertainty is ħ/(2Δt), so approximately, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt).

Wait, some sources say ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). So perhaps I should have used that.

So, ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s.

So for E1:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt) = (1.055e-34)/(2 * 1e-9) ) = 1.055e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.275e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.275e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly for E2, Δt=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt) = 1.055e-34 / (2e-8) = 5.275e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.275e-27 /1.602e-19 = approx 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum of the two uncertainties is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference (E2-E1) must be greater than 3.62e-7 eV.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, 1e-4 eV. That's 1e-4 = 1e-4. Which is 1e-4 = 100e-6, which is 1e-4 eV compared to 3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-4 is way larger. So that's acceptable.

But wait, the options don't have any higher than 1e-4 eV except perhaps option C is the only one that's higher than the required 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, but what about option D? Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV. Which is much smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So that's not sufficient. So the only option that is larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV is option C.

So the correct answer would be option C:1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For distinguishability, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{actual}} = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy for the two states, \( \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \), to ensure their energy levels do not overlap.

### Step 1: Calculate energy uncertainties
The lifetimes of the two states are \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using the uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2}.
\]

Substituting \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting the results to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Total energy uncertainty
The total energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the actual energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{actual}} \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{actual}} > \Delta E_{\text{total}} = 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \, \text{nano-eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.01 \, \text{pico-eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.01 \, \text{nano-eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E_{\text{actual}} > 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
