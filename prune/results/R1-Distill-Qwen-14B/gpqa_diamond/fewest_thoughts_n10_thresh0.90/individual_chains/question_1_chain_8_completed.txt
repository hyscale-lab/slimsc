Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve them, the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So ΔE_diff = |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is that the energy resolution required is ΔE_res ≈ ħ/(Δt), where Δt is the time over which the measurement is made. But since the states have different lifetimes, perhaps the measurement time is related to the shorter lifetime? Or maybe it's the longer one? Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the given data. The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 sec, τ2 = 1e-8 sec. So τ2 is longer than τ1. So the energy uncertainty for E1 is ħ/τ1, which is larger than ħ/τ2 because τ1 is smaller. Because when τ is smaller, 1/τ is larger, so ΔE is larger.

Wait, ħ is about 1e-34 J·s. Let's calculate the energy uncertainties. Let me compute each ΔE: for τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 ≈ 1e-34 J·s / 1e-9 s = 1e-25 J. To convert J to eV, since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 1e-25 J is 1e-25 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.25e-7 eV.

Wait wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate that: 1e-25 J divided by 1.6e-19 J/eV is (1e-25)/(1.6e-19) = (1/1.6) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.625e-6 eV, which is 6.25e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s: ΔE2 = ħ/τ2 = 1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26 J. Convert that to eV: 1e-26 / 1.6e-19 = (1/1.6) * 1e-7 ≈ 0.625e-7 eV = 6.25e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is 6.25e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.25e-8 eV.

Wait, that's a big difference. So ΔE1 is much larger than ΔE2. Because τ1 is shorter, the uncertainty in E1 is larger.

So to resolve the two states, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum, the two energy levels might not be resolvable.

Wait, but wait—let me think about which way the uncertainty goes. Since E1 is the lower energy state, perhaps. But regardless, the difference must be bigger than the sum of their uncertainties.

So, the minimum required ΔE is ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Which would be (6.25e-7 + 6.25e-8) eV. Let's compute that: 6.25e-7 is 6.25 * 1e-7, 6.25e-8 is 0.625e-7. So adding them gives 6.875e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 6.875e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 6.875e-7 is 0.0000006875 eV. So option C is much larger. So it would satisfy the condition.

But wait, the question is about which option could be their energy difference. So we have to find which option is larger than the sum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the way the problem is phrased, each state has its own lifetime, but perhaps the measurement time is the same for both. Or maybe the energy difference is determined based on the minimal time needed to resolve them.

Alternatively, perhaps the time resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. The energy-time uncertainty is ΔE Δt ~ ħ. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i ≈ ħ/τ_i.

We have two states, so to resolve them, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

As calculated earlier, ΔE1 is about 6.25e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.25e-8 eV, sum is about 6.875e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 6.875e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.000000001 eV → smaller than required. So not acceptable.

Option B:1e-11 eV → same issue, much smaller.

Option C:1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → larger than 6.875e-7 eV. So it's acceptable.

Option D:1e-8 eV → which is 0.00000001 eV. That's smaller than 6.875e-7. So not acceptable.

Therefore, the correct option is C.

Wait a second, but wait—another thought. Is the time uncertainty for each state the same, or do we have a combined time uncertainty? Because in reality, when you have two states, perhaps the total time uncertainty is the maximum of the two lifetimes, or perhaps the minimum. Because if you're trying to measure the energy difference, maybe the time you can 'observe' is limited by the shorter lifetime.

Wait, perhaps the time uncertainty Δt is the maximum of the two lifetimes, or perhaps the minimum. Let me think again.

In the context of the energy-time uncertainty principle, each state has its own lifetime. Suppose the two states are being measured, perhaps the measurement time is determined by the longer lifetime. Or perhaps the time is determined by the shorter lifetime.

Wait, that might complicate things. Let me try to think again.

Wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ. So for each state, Δt is the lifetime τ. So for state 1, ΔE1 = ħ/τ1, and for state 2, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2.

So if the energy difference between E1 and E2 is ΔE, then to resolve them, ΔE must be greater than the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Because if ΔE is less than the sum, the two energy levels might be within each other's uncertainty intervals, making them indistinguishable.

So, correct approach is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2 )

Compute that:

τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s.

So 1/τ1 = 1e9 s^-1, 1/τ2 = 1e8 s^-1. Sum is 1.1e9 s^-1.

So ħ (1.05e-34 J·s) * (1.1e9 s^-1) = 1.05e-34 * 1.1e9 = approximately 1.155e-25 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J. So 1.155e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.22e-7 eV.

So, approximately 7.2e-7 eV.

Thus, the energy difference must be larger than 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, much larger than 7.2e-7. So option C is acceptable.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \) that allows them to be clearly resolved, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \hbar
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the energy uncertainty. For each state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

Substituting \( \hbar \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting these to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > 6.56 \times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, compare this with the options:

- **Option A:** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) — Too small.
- **Option B:** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) — Too small.
- **Option C:** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) — Much larger than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), satisfies the condition.
- **Option D:** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) — Too small.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to resolve the two states.

**Answer: C**
