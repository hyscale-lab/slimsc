Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, such that it is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Since it's proportional, I need to normalize it. So, the first step is to find the normalization constant.

The normalization condition is that the inner product of |alpha> with itself equals 1. So, let me write |alpha> as a vector. Let me denote |up> as the first basis vector and |down> as the second. So the vector would be [1+i, 2-i]^T, right? But since it's proportional, we have some normalization factor.

The normalization is 1 = |(1+i)|^2 + |(2 -i)|^2. Because when you take the inner product, you sum the squares of the magnitudes of each component. So calculating each term:

|1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2? Wait no, wait. The magnitude squared of a complex number a + bi is a^2 + b^2. So (1 + i) would have a magnitude squared of 1^2 +1^2 = 2. 

Wait, no, wait, (1+i) is (real part 1, imaginary part 1). So, |1 +i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2 -i]^T.

Alright, that's the first part done. The state is normalized.

Now, the operator whose matrix elements are A_ij. The matrix is 2x2 (since it's spin-1/2), with A_ij = hbar/2 if i!=j, else 0. So the matrix looks like this:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, wait because for i not equal to j. So row 1, column 2 is hbar/2, row 2, column 1 is hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the problem says that the operator's eigenstates are to be used for measurement probabilities. So the operator A has its own eigenstates, and we need to find the probabilities of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates.

So the plan is: find the eigenstates of operator A, express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, then the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Let's proceed.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

Matrix A is:

[0    hbar/2]
[hbar/2 0 ]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI) =0.

So,

| (-λ)    hbar/2 |
| hbar/2  (-λ) | = 0

The determinant is λ^2 - (hbar^2)/(4) =0.

So, λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 → λ= ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, finding the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v =0 → [ -hbar/2  hbar/2 ] [a]   =0
                [ hbar/2 -hbar/2 ] [b]

So the equations are:

(-hbar/2) a + (hbar/2) b =0 → -a + b =0 → b =a.

So the eigenvector can be written as [1; 1], or any scalar multiple. But we can normalize it if needed.

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A - (-λ) I) v =0 → [ hbar/2  hbar/2 ] [a] =0
                [ hbar/2  hbar/2 ] [b]

The equations become:

(hbar/2 a ) + (hbar/2 b) = 0 → a + b =0 → b = -a.

So the eigenvector is [1; -1], again up to normalization.

So the eigenstates are |+> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down>) and |-> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down>).

Wait, wait: the eigenvectors I found are (1,1) and (1,-1). So these are the states |+> and |->, but normalized. So |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Okay, now that I have the eigenstates of A, I can express |alpha> in terms of these |+> and |->.

So |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

But our |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which I can relate to |+> and |->.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expansion coefficients in the basis of |+> and |->. Let me proceed.

Let me express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

First, express |up> and |down> in terms of |+> and |->.

We have:

|up> = (|+> + |->)/sqrt(2)

|down> = (|+> - |->)/sqrt(2)

So substitute these into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * |down>

= (1+i)/sqrt(7) [ (|+> + |->)/sqrt(2) ] + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) [ (|+> - |->)/sqrt(2) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [ (1+i) (|+> + |->) + (2 -i)(|+> - |->) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Expanding the numerator:

(1+i)|+> + (1+i)|-> + (2 -i)|+> - (2 -i)|->

Group the |+> and |-> terms:

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] |+> + [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] |->

Compute coefficients:

For |+>:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i → 3.

For |->:

(1 +i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i + i) = (-1) + 2i.

So numerator becomes 3 |+> + (-1 + 2i)|->.

So putting it back into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ 3 |+> + (-1 + 2i)|- ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

So the coefficients for |+> and |-> are 3/(sqrt(14)) and (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, no: the denominator is sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(14). So yes.

So, c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14)
c_- = (-1 + 2i)/ sqrt(14)

But wait, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, let me recalculate the expression:

After expanding, the numerator is [ (1+i + 2 -i) |+> + (1+i - (2 -i)) |-> ]

Which is [ (3) |+> + (1+ i -2 +i) |-> ]

Which is [3 |+> + (-1 + 2i) |-> ]

So the coefficients are 3/(sqrt(14)) and (-1 +2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the magnitude squared for each coefficient, which gives the probabilities.

The probability for |+> is |c_+|^2 = (3)^2 / (sqrt(14))^2 =9/14.

Similarly, the probability for |-> is |c_-|^2 = | (-1 + 2i) |^2 /14.

Compute | -1 +2i |^2: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5.

So |c_-|^2 =5/14.

Wait, wait, but 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So that works.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the probabilities for each eigenstate, which are |+> and |->. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14 ≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That's close. Let me check:

9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So the options for the probabilities would match option A's first two numbers, which are 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, let me make sure. Because sometimes when you have an operator, you might have to calculate the expectation value, but in this case, the question is about the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. So yes, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are about 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of the operator A.

Average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is an observable with eigenvalues λ_+ = hbar/2 and λ_- =-hbar/2, and |alpha> is expressed as c_+ |+> + c_- |->, the expectation value would be |c_+|^2 * λ_+ + |c_-|^2 * λ_-.

Wait, wait, but perhaps I should compute it correctly.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is in terms of |+> and |->, the expectation value is sum over i |c_i|^2 λ_i.

So here, |c_+|^2 is 9/14 and λ_+ is hbar/2.

Similarly, |c_-|^2 is5/14, and λ_- is -hbar/2.

So expectation = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [9hbar/(28)] - [5hbar/(28)] = (4hbar)/(28) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ... and hbar/7.

So option A's average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So the correct option should be option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the expansion.

Wait another thought: could I have computed the expectation value differently, perhaps via the matrix elements?

Let me compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

|alpha> is (1+i, 2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, compute A|alpha>:

A|alpha> = A * [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T / sqrt(7)

A * vector:

First component: (0)(1+i) + (hbar/2)(2 -i) = (hbar/2)(2 -i) = hbar (1 - i/2)

Second component: (hbar/2)(1+i) + (0)(2 -i) = hbar/2 (1+i)

So A|alpha> = [ hbar(1 - i/2), hbar(1+i)/2 ]^T / sqrt(7)

Then, the inner product with |alpha>:

= [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ hbar(1 - i/2)/sqrt(7), hbar(1+i)/2 /sqrt(7) ]

Wait, no, more correctly:

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute A|alpha>.

A|alpha> is A multiplied by |alpha>.

|alpha> is [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

So:

A|alpha> = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ] * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T / sqrt(7)

Calculating each component:

First component: 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)
= (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Second component: (hbar/2)*(1 +i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)
= (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7)

So A|alpha> is [ (hbar(2 -i))/(2 sqrt(7)), (hbar(1 + i))/(2 sqrt(7)) ]^T.

Then, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar(2 -i))/(2 sqrt(7)), (hbar(1 +i))/(2 sqrt(7)) ]

Breaking it into components:

= (1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar(2 -i))/(2 sqrt(7)) ) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar(1 +i))/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Multiply terms:

Each term is (hbar)/(2 * 7) times the product of the respective factors.

So:

= hbar/(14) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each product:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i -1 (since i²= -1)
= 1 -3i

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 + i*i
= 2 + 2i +i + i²
= 2 +3i -1
=1 +3i

Sum: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the expectation value is (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7.

Which matches the earlier result. So the average is indeed hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14 ≈0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7 → correct.

Other options: Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't match.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves an electron in the state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. The first step is to normalize this state. The normalization factor is determined by requiring ⟨α|α⟩ = 1. The components of |α⟩ are (1+i) and (2-i), so their magnitudes squared are |1+i|² = 2 and |2-i|² = 5. The total normalization factor is √(2+5) = √7, so the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 1+i \\ 2-i \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) has a matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \(\det(A - \lambda I) = 0\), yielding \(\lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}\). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

\[
|+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |−⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state |α⟩ is expressed in terms of \(|+⟩\) and \(|-⟩\). Using the relations:

\[
|up⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+⟩ + |−⟩), \quad |down⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+⟩ - |−⟩),
\]

we substitute into |α⟩:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩\right].
\]

Expanding in terms of \(|+⟩\) and \(|-⟩\), we find:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} |+⟩ + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} |-⟩.
\]

The coefficients \(c_+\) and \(c_-\) are \(3/\sqrt{14}\) and \((-1+2i)/\sqrt{14}\), respectively. The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \(|+⟩\) and \(|-⟩\) are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+⟩) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-⟩) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

The average value of the operator \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α| A |α⟩.
\]

Using the eigenstates \(|+⟩\) and \(|-⟩\), this becomes:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \(|c_+|^2 = 9/14\) and \(|c_-|^2 = 5/14\), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is \(\hbar/7\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \(\hbar/7\).**

Answer: A
