Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator. So |alpha> is a linear combination of these basis states. But wait, proportional means there's a normalization constant. I need to find that first.

To find the normalization, I should calculate the norm of the vector. The norm squared is the sum of the absolute squares of the coefficients. Let me compute each coefficient's magnitude squared.

The coefficient for |up> is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the magnitude of a complex number a + ib is sqrt(a² + b²), so the square is a² + b². So (1+i) has magnitude squared 1 + 1 = 2. 

The coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is 2² + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the question is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator with matrix A. The matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles. Let me write that out.

Matrix A has 0s on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. So it looks like [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. It reminds me of the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A looks like (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because Pauli X has 1s off-diagonal, so A = (ħ/2) * σ_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, since they're proportional. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator.

So now the problem is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates when in state |alpha>, and then compute the average value of operator A.

First, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, perhaps I can find the expansion coefficients in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, let me think. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So any state can be expressed in terms of these. Let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

First, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

Let me denote the coefficients as a = (1+i)/sqrt(7) and b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>.

Now, substitute |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We have:
|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = a [ (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) ] + b [ (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ a (|+x> + |-x>) + b (|+x> - |-x>) ] / sqrt(2)

Group terms:

= [ (a + b)|+x> + (a - b)|-x> ] / sqrt(2)

So the coefficients for |+x> and |-x> are (a + b)/sqrt(2) and (a - b)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Let me compute a + b and a - b.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

a + b = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3 + 0i)/sqrt(7) = 3/sqrt(7)
a - b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7)

Wait, more precisely, since a and b are divided by sqrt(7), when I add them, it's (1+i + 2 -i) all over sqrt(7). So the numerator is 3, as i's cancel.

So the coefficients are:

C_+x = (a + b) / sqrt(2) = (3/sqrt(7)) / sqrt(2) = 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) = 3/sqrt(14)
C_-x = (a - b) / sqrt(2) = ( (1+i -2 +i ) / sqrt(7) ) / sqrt(2) = ( (-1 + 2i) ) / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) )

But wait, the probabilities are the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients.

So the probability P_+x is |C_+x|^2 = (3^2)/(14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64. Let's look at the options:

Option A has 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let's compute the other probabilities.

Similarly, the probability for |-x> is |C_-x|^2.

Compute C_-x: (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571, which is about 0.357.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is about 0.357. So the probabilities are approximately 64.29% and 35.71%.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. So that's close. But wait, maybe I did something wrong because the coefficients might have different behavior.

Wait, no, wait. The coefficients for |+x> and |-x> are (3/sqrt(14)) and (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14). So their squared magnitudes are 9/14 and (1 +4)/14 =5/14. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571.

But looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That's the closest. But let me check other options.

Option D says 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't match. Option B has 0.54 and 0.46, which is 54% and 46%, which are 7/13 and 7/13, but that doesn't match our calculation. So perhaps the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which is approximately 0.64 and 0.357, so 0.36 is a bit off. Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357142, which is about 0.357. So 0.36 is an approximate value. So probably, option A has 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me compute 9/14 exactly. 9 divided by 14 is 0.642857..., so the first probability is about 0.6429, which rounds to 0.64. The second is 5/14 ≈0.3571, so about 0.36. So option A is the correct probabilities. But let me check the options again. Option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So the first part is correct. 

Now, the average value of the operator A. The operator A is given by the matrix [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. Alternatively, since it's proportional to sigma_x, the average value would be <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, which are eigenstates of A, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of A? The eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, and since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1). So when you measure A, you get either +ħ/2 or -ħ/2.

So the expectation value <A> is the probability of |+x> times (ħ/2) plus the probability of |-x> times (-ħ/2).

So <A> = P_+x*(ħ/2) + P_-x*(-ħ/2) = [ (9/14)(1) - (5/14)(1) ] * (ħ/2 )

= [ (9-5)/14 ] * (ħ/2 )

= (4/14) * (ħ/2 ) = (2/7) * (ħ/2 ) = ħ/7.

Wait, because (4/14) simplifies to 2/7, then 2/7 * (ħ/2) equals (2 * ħ) / (7 * 2 ) = ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7. Looking back at the options, option A says average is ħ/7. So that matches.

So putting it together: the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. That matches option A.

Wait, but let me cross-verify. Another approach: compute <A> directly.

Matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So <A> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Let me compute this.

A is a 2x2 matrix, so let me denote the state vector as a column vector:

c1 = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
c2 = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So the expectation value is c1* * A * c1 + c2* * A * c2 ?

Wait, no, more accurately, the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha> = [c1*, c2*] * A * [c1; c2]

Which is the sum over i,j: c_i* A_ij c_j.

So let me compute this:

= c1* * A_11 * c1 + c1* * A_12 * c2 + c2* * A_21 * c1 + c2* * A_22 * c2

But since A_11 =0, A_22=0, so those terms drop out.

So it's c1* A_12 c2 + c2* A_21 c1.

But A_12 = ħ/2, and A_21= ħ/2. So:

= c1* (ħ/2) c2 + c2* (ħ/2) c1.

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ c1* c2 + c2* c1 ]

= (ħ/2) [ (c1* c2) + (c2* c1) ) ]

But c1* c2 is (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = [ (1+i)(2 -i) ] /7.

Let me compute (1+i)(2 - i):

Multiply: 1*2 =2, 1*(-i) = -i, i*2 = 2i, i*(-i) = -i²= -(-1)=+1.

So 2 -i +2i +1 = (2+1) + ( -i +2i )=3 +i.

So c1* c2 = (3 +i)/7.

Similarly, c2* c1 is (2 -i)(1 +i)/7.

Compute (2 -i)(1+i):

2*1=2, 2*i=2i, (-i)*1= -i, (-i)*i= -i²= +1.

So 2+2i -i +1 = 3 +i.

So (2 -i)(1+i)=3 +i → c2* c1 is (3 +i)/7.

So back to the expectation value:

= (ħ/2) [ (3 +i)/7 + (3 +i)/7 ) ]

= (ħ/2) [ 2(3 +i)/7 ]

= (ħ/2) * (6 + 2i)/7

Wait, wait a second. That can't be right because the expectation value should be a real number, as A is Hermitian (since it's a quantum operator). Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me check the multiplication again. Wait, (2 -i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i -i*1 -i*i → 2 +2i -i -i² → 2 +i -(-1) → 2 +i +1 → 3 +i. So that's correct.

Wait, but when I compute c1* c2 + c2* c1, that's (3 +i)/7 + (3 +i)/7 = 2*(3 +i)/7. So the sum is (6 + 2i)/7.

Then, when I multiply by (ħ/2), I get (ħ/2)*(6 +2i)/7 = (6ħ + 2i ħ)/(14) = (3ħ + i ħ)/7.

Wait, that's a problem because the expectation value shouldn't be complex. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait a second, I think I messed up the matrix multiplication. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the matrix product correctly. Let me re-calculate the expectation value correctly.

So, the state |alpha> is [c1, c2] = [(1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7)]^T.

The density matrix is |alpha><alpha|, so the expectation value is Tr(A |alpha><alpha|) = sum_{i,j} A_ij c_i* c_j.

Wait, no, more accurately, it's sum_{i,j} A_ij * c_i^* c_j.

Because |alpha><alpha| has elements c_i c_j^*, and when you multiply by A, you get sum_{kl} A_kl c_k c_l^*.

Wait, perhaps I should use this approach.

Wait, let's compute <alpha| A |alpha> as sum_{i,j} A_ij (c_i^*) c_j.

So:

sum_{i,j} A_ij c_i^* c_j.

But A_ij is 0 when i=j, and A_ij = ħ/2 when i != j.

So for i=1, j=2: A_12 = ħ/2. So term is (ħ/2) c_1^* c_2.

Similarly, i=2, j=1: A_21 = ħ/2, term is (ħ/2) c_2^* c_1.

So <A> = (ħ/2)( c1^* c2 + c2^* c1 )

Which is the same as before.

Hmm, but this gives me a complex number, which shouldn't be the case. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of c1^* c2 and c2^* c1.

Wait, let's compute c1^* and c2.

c1 = (1 + i)/sqrt(7). So c1^* is (1 - i)/sqrt(7).

c2 = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So c1^* c2 is (1 -i)(2 -i) /7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) =2, (1)(-i)= -i, (-i)(2) = -2i, (-i)(-i) = i²= -1.

So 2 -i -2i + (-1) = (2-1) + (-i -2i) = 1 -3i.

So c1^* c2 = (1 -3i)/7.

Wait, that's different from what I had before. Hmm, earlier I thought it was (3+i)/7, but no.

Wait, perhaps I confused the order earlier. Let me compute c1^* * c2 again.

c1^* is (1-i)/sqrt(7), c2 is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Multiply: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i +i² → 2 -3i + (-1) → 1 -3i.

So c1^* c2 = (1-3i)/7.

Similarly, c2^* is (2 +i)/sqrt(7), multiplied by c1=(1 +i)/sqrt(7).

So c2^* c1 = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Multiply numerator: 2*1=2, 2*i=2i, i*1=i, i*i= i²=-1.

So 2 +2i +i + (-1) = (2-1) + (3i) = 1 +3i.

So c2^* c1 = (1 +3i)/7.

So now, the sum c1^* c2 + c2^* c1 is (1-3i +1 +3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

Yes! That makes sense. So the expectation value is real, as it should be.

So the average is ħ/7, which matches option A.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves an electron in a state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of A.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The coefficients of |α⟩ are (1+i) for |up⟩ and (2-i) for |down⟩. The norm is calculated as:

\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalization constant is \(1/\sqrt{7}\), and the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Express |α⟩ in terms of eigenstates of A
The eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the Pauli X operator, which are:

\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

Substituting these into |α⟩:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+x⟩ + |-x⟩) + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+x⟩ - |-x⟩).
\]

Grouping terms:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} |+x⟩ + \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} |-x⟩.
\]

Simplifying the coefficients:

\[
\text{Coefficient of } |+x⟩ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad \text{Coefficient of } |-x⟩ = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the particle in |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
P_{+x} = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad P_{-x} = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{1+4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

These probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

### Step 4: Calculate the average value of A
The operator A is proportional to the Pauli X operator, with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The expectation value of A is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P_{+x} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P_{-x} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is ħ/7. These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
