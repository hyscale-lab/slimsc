Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about the decay of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what do I remember about particle decay and the factors affecting the number of observed decays? Oh right, the number of decays observed depends on the speed of the particle and the lifetime as seen in the lab frame. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving at high speeds, we have to consider time dilation.

Time dilation comes from Einstein's theory of relativity. The lifetime observed in the lab frame (τ) is τ₀ multiplied by gamma (γ), which is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to the total energy of the particle divided by its rest mass energy. So γ = E / (m c²), but since energy and mass are given in compatible units (GeV), maybe the c² is already accounted for. Wait, the energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV, so γ would just be 27 / 3.41, right?

Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's do 3.41 × 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 × 8 is 27.28. Oh, so 27 is just a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So γ is approximately 7.91. Maybe roughly 7.9 or 8?

Next, the mean lifetime τ is γ times τ₀. So τ ≈ 8 × 1e-16 s. Let me compute that. τ ≈ 8 × 8e-16 = 64e-16 s? Wait no, wait. τ is γ multiplied by τ₀. Oh, so τ = γ * τ₀. So with γ≈8, τ ≈8 *8e-16 = 6.4e-15 seconds? Wait wait, wait. Wait the given τ₀ is 8e-16 s. So τ = (27 / 3.41) * 8e-16.

Wait let me compute 27 /3.41 numerically. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41 * 7.9 is 27 - let's see: 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069. So 23.87 +3.069=26.939, which is very close to 27. So 7.9. So γ≈7.9.

So τ = 7.9 * 8e-16 s = 63.2e-16 s = 6.32e-15 seconds. Hmm.

Now, the next part is about the resolution needed. The resolution is the ability to distinguish the decay products, so it's probably related to the length over which the decay is observed. Oh, right, the minimum resolution (let's call it L) is the average decay length. Because if the particle decays, you need to be able to see the decay point. But wait, the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So the detection efficiency should be 30% or higher.

Wait, the decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = v * τ. But wait, velocity v is (β c), where β is v/c. And β is (p c)/E, where p is momentum. Alternatively, since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², so (pc) = sqrt(E² - m² c^4). Hmm.

Alternatively, since E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV, the momentum p can be calculated. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute βγ and then get v.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²), but since E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV, gamma is 27/3.41 ≈7.9. So beta can be found from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta² = 1 - (1/gamma²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.9)^2)).

Calculating 7.9 squared: 7.9 *7.9 = 62.41. So 1/62.41 ≈0.016. So 1 - 0.016 = 0.984. So beta is sqrt(0.984)≈0.99196. So beta is about 0.992.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.992c. So v ≈0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.976e8 m/s.

So now, the decay length L is v * τ. Wait, but τ is the mean lifetime in the lab frame. So L = v τ.

So L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.32e-15 s.

Wait, let me compute that. Let's compute 3e8 * 6.32e-15 first. 3 *6.32 =18.96, and 1e8 *1e-15=1e-7. So 18.96e-7 m. Then multiply by 0.992: approximately 18.74e-7 m. Or 1.874e-6 meters.

Wait, but wait, that's the average decay length. So the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So I think the idea is that if the resolution is at least the decay length, then you can observe the decay. But wait, if the resolution is just the decay length, perhaps you can only observe about 37% (since the distribution is exponential), but the question requires 30% efficiency. So maybe the required L is such that the efficiency is 30% or higher.

Wait, but perhaps the minimum resolution is the mean decay length. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The minimum resolution needed is the decay length, because if the decay point is within that, you can observe it. But wait, that's not exactly correct, because the decay length is the average distance. So if the resolution is the decay length, the probability of seeing the decay is the integral of the decay probability starting from 0 to L. The decay probability is 1 - e^(-t/τ), where t is the time. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the length.

Wait, the number of decays observed depends on the detection's ability to distinguish the decay point. The decay length is the average distance, but the actual distribution is exponential.

The formula for the probability of decay within a length L is P = 1 - e^(-L/(βγ c τ₀)).

Wait, wait, another approach: The proper lifetime is τ₀, and the lab frame lifetime is τ=γ τ₀. The average decay length is L_avg = β c τ. So β is ~0.992, c is 3e8 m/s, τ is 6.32e-15 s.

So L_avg is 0.992 *3e8 m/s *6.32e-15 s.

Let me compute that:

0.992 *3e8 is approximately 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.32e-15 s: 2.976e8 *6.32e-15 = (2.976 *6.32) *1e-7.

Calculate 2.976 *6.32. Let's see, 3 *6 is 18, 3 *0.32=0.96, 0.976*(6.32)= about 6.16 + 0.976*0.32=0.31232. Hmm, wait maybe a better approach: 2.976 *6 =17.856, 2.976 *0.32=0.95232. So total is 17.856 +0.95232=18.80832. So 18.80832e-7 m =1.8808e-6 m.

So approximately 1.88e-6 meters.

But the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution needs to be at least a certain fraction of the average decay length. Let me think about the decay probability.

The probability P that the particle decays within a certain length L is P = 1 - e^(-L/(βγ c τ₀)).

Wait, because the mean decay length is L_avg = βγ c τ₀. So the probability to decay within L is P = 1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)}.

So if we set P =30% (0.3), then:

0.3 =1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)}.

So e^{-L/(L_avg)} = 0.7.

Take natural log: -L/(L_avg) = ln(0.7) ≈-0.35667.

So L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

So L = 0.35667 * 1.88e-6 m ≈ 0.35667 *1.88e-6 ≈ let's compute that.

1.88e-6 *0.35667 ≈ (1.88 *0.35667) e-6.

1.88 *0.35667 ≈ 0.6701.

So L≈0.6701e-6 m → 6.701e-7 m, which is 6.7e-7 m or 670 nm. Hmm.

Wait, but the options are A) 2.08e-6 m, B) 2.08e-9 m, etc. So none of the options match 6.7e-7 m. So perhaps I made a mistake in approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the proper lifetime and the lab frame lifetime. Wait, the calculation of L_avg was correct as beta * c * tau, where tau is gamma * tau0.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the decay length in terms of beta gamma c tau0.

Wait, tau = gamma tau0, so L_avg = beta * c * tau = beta * gamma * tau0 * c.

Wait, in terms of the mass and energy, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, another formula: The decay length is L = (gamma v τ0) c. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the beta and gamma.

Wait, beta is v/c, so v = beta c. Then, the decay length is L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau0.

But beta gamma = (v/c) * gamma = gamma v/c. Hmm, wait, but gamma is E/(m c²), so beta gamma = (E/(m c²)) * (v/c) = E/(m c²) * beta. Wait, but E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2, so p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). Then, p c = sqrt( (27 GeV)^2 - (3.41 GeV)^2 ) → let me compute that.

27^2 is 729, 3.41^2≈11.6281. So 729 -11.6281=717.3719. So sqrt(717.3719)= approx 26.8 GeV. So p c =26.8 GeV.

Then, beta is (pc)/(E) = (26.8 GeV)/(27 GeV) ≈0.9926. So beta is about 0.9926, which matches what I had before.

So, L_avg = beta gamma c tau0. Let me compute beta gamma.

Gamma is E/(m c²) =27 /3.41 ≈7.918.

So beta gamma is 0.9926 *7.918 ≈7.857.

So L_avg= beta gamma c tau0.

c is 3e8 m/s. tau0 is 8e-16 s.

So L_avg =7.857 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute that:

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 → 2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.857: 2.4e-7 *7.857 ≈18.8568e-7 m → 1.88568e-6 m.

So L_avg≈1.885e-6 m, or 1.885 microns.

So that's about 1.88e-6 meters.

Wait, but the options given are A)2.08e-6 m, B)2.08e-9, etc. So option A is close to 2 microns. Hmm, but my calculation is about 1.88e-6 m, which is approximately 1.88 microns. So why are the options not matching this?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the average decay length but the minimum resolution needed to observe a certain fraction of the decays. So if I need to capture at least 30% of the decays, I need to have a resolution (L) such that P=0.3.

Earlier I had:

P =1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)}.

So to get P=0.3, L= L_avg * ln( (1-P)^{-1} )

Wait, let me rederive it correctly.

The decay probability as a function of distance x is P(x) =1 - e^{-x/(L_avg)}.

We want P(x) ≥0.3 → 1 -e^{-x/(L_avg)} ≥0.3 → e^{-x/(L_avg)} ≤0.7 → -x/(L_avg) ≤ ln(0.7) → x ≥ - L_avg * ln(0.7).

ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, so -ln(0.7)=0.35667.

So x ≥ 0.35667 * L_avg.

So x ≈0.35667 *1.885e-6 m ≈0.35667 *1.885e-6.

Let me compute that: 1.885 *0.35667 ≈0.6709. So 0.6709e-6 m =6.709e-7 m.

That's about 6.7e-7 m, which is 0.67 microns or 670 nm.

But none of the options are this. The options are A)2.08e-6 m (2 microns), B)2.08e-9 (2 nanometers), etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the resolution needed to distinguish the decay point, which is the decay length itself. Because if your resolution is the decay length, you can see the decay. Wait, but the average decay length is L_avg, and the probability to decay before L_avg is about 63.2% (since 1 -e^{-1} ≈0.632). So if the resolution is L_avg, you can observe about 63% of the decays. But the question requires 30% efficiency, so the required L is smaller
