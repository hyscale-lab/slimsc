Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the setup: two stars with the same mass as the Sun, each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The question is about comparing the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. So, I need to find how many times longer the period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method's measured velocity is related to the star's velocity in its orbit around the barycenter. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe a simpler approach. Since the stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like, so much less than the star's mass), M_planet << M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0. So the formula simplifies.

The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_planet) * P )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star )^(1/3) ) ) / ( P^(1/3) ) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the observed velocity.

Wait, another approach: The RV method measures the star's velocity due to the planet. The formula for K (the semi-amplitude) is:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ (2π G / (P c))^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the relationship between K and the orbital period P.

But wait, the problem gives the same planet mass for both (Neptune-like), same star masses. So M_planet and M_star are the same for both. So the only varying factors are K and P.

So, the formula for K can be written as:

K ∝ (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, because when you solve for K, I think it's proportional to (P)^(-1/3). Let me re-express this.

From K equation:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe a better way is to consider Kepler's third law. The RV method is based on the Doppler shift, which relates to the star's velocity. The star's velocity is given by v = 2π a / P, where a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter.

But the planet's orbit has a semi-major axis a_p, and the star's a_s, and a_p = (M_star / M_planet) * a_s. Since M_planet much smaller than M_star, a_p is much larger than a_s.

But perhaps I should think about the relation between the velocity of the star and the orbital period. The star's velocity is v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) P ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, I think I might be complicating this. Let's think about the fact that K (the semi-amplitude of the velocity) is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) P ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps taking the ratio of K1 and K2 will help, because M_planet, M_star, and e are same for both.

So K1/K2 = ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3 )

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K = something * (1/P^(1/3)).

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Alternatively, rearranging: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So, if I know K1 and K2, I can find the ratio of periods.

Wait, in the problem, K is given as the observed shift: 5 milliangstrom for planet 1, 7 for planet 2. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So, K1/K2 = 5/7

So, (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Which means P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Wait, no, wait, if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then higher K means lower P. Because K is 5 for planet1 and 7 for planet2. So planet2 has a higher K, so it has a shorter period.

Wait, let me recheck the setup.

Wait, the star's velocity is K, which is higher when the period is shorter. So a higher K implies a shorter period. Because K is velocity, so if the star is moving faster, the planet must be orbiting more quickly, hence a shorter period.

So, given that K2 is higher than K1, P2 is shorter than P1. But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So that would be P2/P1. But since P2 is smaller, P2/P1 is less than 1, so the ratio is about 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure about the formula. Let me think again about the relation between K and P.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (
