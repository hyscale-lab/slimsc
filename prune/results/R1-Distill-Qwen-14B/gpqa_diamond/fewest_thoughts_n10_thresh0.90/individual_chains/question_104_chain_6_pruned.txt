Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. Interesting.

Wait, I remember the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The shift depends on the star's velocity towards or away from us due to the planet's gravitational pull. The formula involved is something with the velocity amplitude and the mass of the planet.

Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is given by:
K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )
But wait, since the planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star), the denominator simplifies. So it's approximately K ≈ (v * M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, the (1 + M_p/M_star) term is approximately 1. So K ≈ (v * M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (other factors? Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.)

Wait, the correct formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c T ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )

Hmm, maybe that's more precise. Alternatively, I remember another version involving the star's mass and the planet's mass. Let me think.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) )^(1/1) ) * (sin i) ) / ( ( (1 AU)^2 ) * (1 year) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Maybe I should think about the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period.

Wait, I think the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P. Because the RV method depends on the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital parameters.

Wait, let me get this straight. The formula for K is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c) ]^(1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) ] / [ (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should go back to basics. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_star, the denominator (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) is approx 1, so K ≈ v * M_p / M_star^(2/3)

Wait, but how does K relate to the orbital period P?

Oh right, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the star's mass M through Kepler's third law. The formula is:

P² = (4π² a³) / (G M_star)

So a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4 π² )

But K is also related to the velocity of the star, which is v = (2π a) / P. Because the star orbits the center of mass, but since M_p is much smaller, the star's orbit radius is approximately a_p = (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) * a ≈ (M_p/M_star) * a. So the velocity is v = (2π a_p) / P ) ≈ (2π (M_p/M_star) a ) / P.

But from Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G M_star P²) / (4 π² ), so a = [ (G M_star P²) / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting back into velocity:

v ≈ (2 π (M_p/M_star) [ (G M_star P²/(4 π²) )^(1/3) ] ) / P

Simplify this:

v ≈ (2 π M_p/M_star ) * [ (G M_star P²) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/P )

Let me compute [ (G M_star P²) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

That's [ G M_star P² ]^(1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

So, v ≈ (2 π M_p / M_star ) * [ G M_star^(1) P² ]^(1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) * (1/P )

Hmm, let's compute each part.

Let me group terms:

v ≈ (2 π / (4 π² )^(1/3)) ) * ( M_p / M_star ) * (G M_star P² )^(1/3) / P )

Simplify (2 π) / (4 π² )^(1/3):

4^(1/3) is cube root of 4, π squared is π².

So denominator becomes (4)^(1/3) * (π²)^(1/3) ) = 4^(1/3) π^(2/3)

So the entire term is 2 π / [4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ] = 2 π^(1) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) = 2 / 4^(1/3) ) * π^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2 / (2^(2/3)) ) * π^(1/3 )

Wait, 4 is 2², so 4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3). So 2 / 2^(2/3) )= 2^(1 - 2/3 )= 2^(1/3).

So that part becomes 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) )

So now, v ≈ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) ) * ( M_p / M_star ) *
