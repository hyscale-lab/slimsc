Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, but it has dark spots on one hemisphere. The radius is the same as the Sun. The effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler or hotter? Wait, the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. Oh, wait, dark spots... I guess they are cooler because hotter spots would probably appear brighter, right? So, if the star's Teff is 6000K, the spots are either 5000K or 7000K? Wait no, the problem says "temperature difference of 1000K"—so perhaps the spots are 5000K (6000-1000). Because spots are usually cooler.

The filling factor is 20%, that means the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, but it's only one hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. Wait, how's that calculated? The star's radius is R, so area is 4πR². Hemisphere is 2πR². So one hemisphere's area is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So total spotted area is 0.4πR².

The question is about photometric variations. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the brightness to change. But the problem says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet transit. So we need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots.

Wait, but the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots!", so we need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to the variation caused by a planet transiting the star. So, essentially, what's the planet's size that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, but wait. The brightness variation from spots is not a simple dip like a planet's transit. Because when a planet transits, it blocks the light from a part of the star, causing a dip in the brightness. But with spots, when the spots rotate into view, the total brightness of the star would decrease if the spots are cooler, but the question says that the star's brightness variation is periodic due to rotation. Hmm, but the problem states that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet, so the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation.

So, the star's brightness variation due to the spots would be similar to that of a planet blocking part of the star. So, we have to find what planetary radius would cause the same dip as the spots.

Wait, but the star's variation from spots might involve both the spot being cooler and the area covered. But in the problem, when the star isn't covered by spots, what would cause the same signal? So, perhaps the question is comparing the maximum dip in brightness, which would be the same whether it's due to a planet blocking or spots contributing.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is due to the spots modulating the star's light as it rotates. So when the spots are on the visible side, the star's brightness is lower than when they're not. But the problem says that the situation can appear like an exoplanet. So the question is, what exoplanet radius would produce the same brightness variation as these spots cause.

But wait, the star is being observed, and when part of it is blocked (either by a planet or due to the spots), the observed brightness changes. So, the variation in brightness (delta F) is proportional to the area blocked and the difference in brightness between the blocked region and the rest.

Wait, but in the case of a planet, the entire area of the planet blocks the starlight, and the star is at a uniform brightness. So the dip is (Area of planet / Area of star) * 100%, because the planet blocks that part. The brightness change would be (R_planet / R_star)^2, because area scales with radius squared.

In the case of spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, the total emitted light is less. The star's overall brightness varies as the spots rotate in and out of view. So the change in brightness would be the difference between the star's brightness when spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness variation is periodic due to rotation. So the amplitude of the variation would be the difference between the full brightness (no spots visible) and the brightness when spots are visible. So, the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. Wait, no, because the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, which are cooler. So the total brightness would be lower.

But the star's brightness is a function of the surface brightness. The surface brightness is proportional to T^4 (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law). So, the flux from a part of the star is sigma*T^4 * area.

When the star isn't covered by spots, the total flux is F0 = sigma*Teff^4 * 4πR². When the spots are on the same face as us, part of the star's surface is cooler. The area of the spots is A_spots = 0.4πR² (as calculated before). The surface brightness of the spots is sigma*(Teff - delta T)^4. Wait, wait, the problem states that the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K, or Teff + 1000 K? Well, dark spots are cooler, so probably 5000 K.

So, the flux when the spots are visible would be F = (4πR² - A_spots) * sigma*Teff^4 + A_spots * sigma*T_spot^4.

Alternatively, the total flux without spots is F0 = 4πR² * sigma*Teff^4. When spots are visible, F = F0 - (A_spots * sigma) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the change in flux is delta F = F0 - F = A_spots * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the spots come into view, so the observed flux decreases. The amplitude of the brightness variation would be delta F / F0, which is (A_spots * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4πR² sigma Teff^4) ) = (A_spots/(4πR²)) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4.

Simplify:

(A_spots/(4πR²)) is the filling factor for the entire star. Wait, the filling factor for the hemisphere is 20%, but the total area is 0.4πR² as I calculated earlier. So the filling factor for the entire star would be (0.4πR²) / (4πR²) ) = 0.1 or 10%. So the filling factor is 10% for the entire star.

So delta F / F0 = 0.1 * ( (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) / 6000^4 )

Compute 6000^4: 6^4=1296, 10^12, so 1.296e15 (units of K^4). 5000^4 is 5^4=625, so 625e12=6.25e14. So 6000^4 =1.296e15, 5000^4=6.25e14.

So (1.296e15 - 6.25e14)= (1.296 - 0.625) e15=0.671e15.

Divide by 6000^4 (1.296e15): 0.671e15 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.671 / 1.296 ≈ 0.518.

So delta F / F0 = 0.1 * 0.518 ≈ 0.0518 or about 5.18% change.

Wait, but this is the fractional change in flux. Now, the problem says that this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So, what is the amplitude of the light curve due to the planet? The amplitude would be (R_p / R_star)^2, assuming the planet blocks part of the star uniformly bright.

Wait, but in reality, the planet blocks part of the star's disk, so the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2. So the question is, what R_p would give a dip of 5.18%?

So, (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.0518 → R_p/R_star ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227, around 0.23.

But wait, looking at the options, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, 0.23 isn't an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. Let's recalculate the flux change.

Teff =6000K, T_spot=5000K.

Compute (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

= [6000^4 -5000^4]/6000^4 = [ (6000/5000)^4 -1 ].

6000/5000=1.2 → 1.2^4 is 2.0736.

So (2.0736-1)=1.0736.

Wait, no, wait: (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4 =1 - (5/6)^4.

(5/6)^4 is (625)/(1296)=approx 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225=0.51775.

So delta F / F0 = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, which is about 5.18% dip.

So the flux variation is about 5.18% when the spots are fully visible.

Now, the planet would cause a dip of (R_p/R_star)^2.

Wait, but is that correct? Because the dip in brightness is (area blocked)/(area of star). So (R_p^2 / R_star^2) = (R_p/R_star)^2. So yes, the dip is (R_p/R_star)^2.

Wait, but is that the case when the entire spot area contributes to the dip? Because the spots are cooler, but the planet would block part of the star's light. So in the case of the planet, the entire area is blocked, so the dip is R_p^2 / R_star^2.

In the case of the spots, the dip is due to the difference in brightness when spots are visible. So the dip is 5.18% in that scenario.

So to have the same amplitude, the planet's dip should also be 5.18%, so (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.0518 → R_p = R_star * sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2277 R_star, which is about 0.23 R_star. But none of the options are near 0.23.

Hmm, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation and the flux change is different. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the change in brightness as a variation, not a dip. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the dip is a decrease in brightness when the spots are visible, right? So in the spot case, the maximum dip is 5.18% in brightness, and the planet would have a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. So the planet needs to cause a dip of 5.18%, so R_p / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227, which is about 0.23. But that's not an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the flux variation.

Wait another thought: maybe the problem is referring to the amplitude of the brightness variation, not the maximum dip. Because when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, so the brightness variation would peak at the dip and then return. But the amplitude would be the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness. Wait, no, the amplitude would be the half of that, because from the average, the brightness goes down and then back up. So the peak-to-peak variation is 2 times the amplitude.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: when the spot is rotating towards us, the brightness decreases by
