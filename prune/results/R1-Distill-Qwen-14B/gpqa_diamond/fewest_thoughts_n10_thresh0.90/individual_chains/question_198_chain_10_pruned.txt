Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, I remember that stability constants relate the concentrations of the complexes to the ions. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)2]^2+, β3 [CoSCN3]^0, and β4 [CoSCN4]^−2? Or wait, maybe the charges are different. I think each SCN- adds with a -1 charge, so the complexes would have charges that depend on the number of SCN- attached.

But wait, the problem is asking about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Blue suggests it's the [Co(SCN)_n]^m complex with n=2 or 3? I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)₆]^4− complex, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the [Co(SCN)₄]^2− that's blue. Or wait, maybe the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^{n} complex. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the exact complex, but perhaps the problem is more about the calculation regardless.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So that's probably the [Co(SCN)₂]^{+2} complex, since each SCN- contributes -1. Oh wait, [Co^2+] with two SCN- would be Co(SCN)_2^0, because 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So the charge is neutral.

Wait, but the stability constants: each β corresponds to adding one SCN-. So β1 is for Co(SCN)^+, β2 is Co(SCN)_2^2+, β3 is Co(SCN)_3^0, and β4 is Co(SCN)_4^2−? Or maybe that's not the right way to look at it.

Stability constant βn is the formation constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, I think. Because each SCN is -1, so n SCN would give a charge of 2−n.

Wait, let's think. Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+. So β1 is for the first addition. Then [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the β2 would be the formation of this second complex from the first. Wait, but the overall stability constant for the second complex would be β1 * β2, right? Because to form [Co(SCN)_2]^0, you take [Co]^2+ and 2 SCN- and go through the first complex to the second.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering that for each n, the overall formation constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is the product of β1 through βn. So for n=1, β1=9. For n=2, β_total=β1 * β2 = 9*40=360. For n=3, β_total=9*40*63= 9*40 is 360, 360*63 is 22680. For n=4, β_total=9*40*63*16= 22680 *16= 362,880.

Wait, but wait, the problem is that sometimes the stability constants are given for each step, so the overall β for each complex is the product up to that step. So for the first complex, β1=9, for the second, β1*β2=360, third β1*β2*β3=22680, fourth β1*β2*β3*β4= 362880.

So the total concentration of all the Co species would be the sum of the concentrations of Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

But wait, the concentrations of each complex can be found using the formation constants. Since the solution has a fixed [SCN-] and [Co^2+] is part of the total cobalt, perhaps we can model the distribution.

But this seems complicated. Another approach is to use the concept of the distribution ratio. The fraction of each complex is given by the product of the β's divided by (1 + sum of all possible β products up to each n).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the log of the concentrations. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the fraction of each species.

Wait, the general formula is that for each species [Co(SCN)_n], the concentration is (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n / (1 + sum_{k=1 to max} (β1 β2 ... βk) [SCN^-]^k )).

Wait, but [Co^2+] is in the numerator for each term, but since it's the same for all, perhaps we can factor it out.

Wait, let's denote [Co^2+] as C. Then the concentration of each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is β1β2...βn * [SCN-]^n * C.

But the total concentration of all species is C_total = C + sum_{n=1 to 4} (β1β2...βn) [SCN]^n * C.

Since the total Co concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all the Co species.

Wait, wait, [Co^2+] is C. Then each complex contributes to the total. So the total is C + sum_{n=1 to 4} (β1β2...βn) [SCN]^n * C = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

So we can write C_total = C [ 1 + sum_{n=1 to 4} (β1β2...βn) [SCN]^n ]

But [SCN] is given as 0.1 M. Let's compute each term:

First, compute the product β1β2...βn for each n.

n=1: β1=9

n=2: β1*β2=9*40=360

n=3: 360 *63=22680

n=4: 22680 *16= 362880

Now [SCN] is 0.1 M. So for each n, [SCN]^n is (0.1)^1 = 0.1, (0.1)^2=0.01, (0.1)^3=0.001, (0.1)^4=0.0001.

So let's calculate each term:

n=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2: 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

n=3: 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68

n=4: 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288

So sum each term:

n=1: 0.9

n=2: 3.6 → sum
