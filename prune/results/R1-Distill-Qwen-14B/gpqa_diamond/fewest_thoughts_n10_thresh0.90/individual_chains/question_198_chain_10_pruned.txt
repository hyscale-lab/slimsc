Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

So the problem says that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, first, I should remember what stability constants are. Stability constant (β) indicates how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable. So, for each complex, the β tells us the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the ions.

The complexes probably form in a stepwise manner. So Co^2+ can bind SCN^- in steps: first to form [Co(SCN)]^+, then [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, and so on. The stability constants β1, β2, etc., are for each step.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think blue refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex. So I need to find the concentration of this species relative to all possible cobalt species.

The possible cobalt species are the free Co^2+ ion and the various complexes: [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+}. Because β4 is 16, but wait, I've heard that sometimes the overall stability constant is the product of the stepwise constants. So maybe β_total for each complex is the product up to that step.

Wait, the problem gives β1, β2, β3, β4 as the stability constants. So I think β1 is for the first complex formation: Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+; β1=9.

Then β2 is for the next step: [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}; β2=40.

Similarly, β3 is for the third step: [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}; β3=63.

And β4 is for the fourth step: [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+} + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+}; β4=16.

So the overall stability constant for each complex is the product up to that β. For example, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is β1 * β2.

But wait, sometimes β is given as the overall constant for the complex, not stepwise. Oh, the problem states that these are the stability constants of the complexes. Wait, no, the question says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Hmm, I think that usually, the stability constant for a complex is the overall constant, which would be the product of the stepwise constants. But sometimes, in some contexts, stepwise constants are given.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The stability constants can be represented either as stepwise (each successive binding) or as overall (the product of all steps up to that point). So the problem says β1=9, β2=40, etc. So perhaps each β represents the overall constant for the n-th complex. So for example, β1 is the stability constant for [CoSCN]^+ (monodentate), β2 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, and so on.

Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense, because the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would be β1 * β2. But in some references, the overall stability constants are given. So perhaps in this problem, β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, etc. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps these are formation constants for each step. Let me clarify that.

If the stability constants are stepwise, then for each additional SCN^- added, the step's β is given. So β1 is the constant for the first binding, β2 for the second, etc. So the overall constant for the n-th complex is the product up to βn.

So for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+,
