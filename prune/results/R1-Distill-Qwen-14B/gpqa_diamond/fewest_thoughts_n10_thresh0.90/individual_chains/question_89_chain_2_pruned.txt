Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's quite rigid and has a lot of bridgehead positions. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. So, when it's heated with excess KOH, what happens here?

KOH is a strong base. I think when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with bases, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide—it's a diegeminal or maybe a para dihalide? Hmm, wait, no. Adamantane's structure has each carbon connected to adjacent ones in a diamond lattice. So 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent carbons but not directly across. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, no, 1 and 3 are on the same bridge. Let me think. Adamantane has four bridgeheads. If it's 1,3-dibromo, then the bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads. So, for example, looking at the structure, each bridgehead is connected to two others. So, 1 and 3 would be adjacent bridgeheads, each with a Br attached.

So, when heated with KOH, which is a strong base, it's likely an E2 elimination. Because you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between those two carbons. So, the product would be 1,3-didehydrodiamantane or something similar, but more accurately, I think it would form an alkene. So, the product after KOH would be an adamantene derivative with a double bond.

But wait, the product description says a light yellow solid. And the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests that the product is a ketone. Hmm, but I thought elimination would give an alkene.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about the reaction conditions. KOH can also undergo substitution reactions. But with two bromines, maybe elimination is more favorable. Alternatively, if it's an E2 elimination, the product would be an alkene, which wouldn't have a carbonyl. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, the product after KOH is product 1. The IR shows a peak at 1720, which definitely suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Wait, but with two bromines, substitution would give a diol, but that's unlikely to have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation but with a different outcome. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a peroxide effect, but I don't think KOH is a peroxide.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but that would form a diene. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing more of a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is undergoing a neighboring group participation. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution with elimination of HBr, but that would require two substitutions, which would form a molecule with two hydroxyl groups, which I don't think is what the IR is pointing to.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution with a different base. Wait, KOH can also act as a strong base and a nucleophile. Substitution of two bromines would give a diol. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide? No, epoxide would have a different IR. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group formed via oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something in the initial reaction. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH—could it be a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene? But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a diene. Oh, wait, maybe it's a keto compound. Let me think about the possible structure. If two adjacent bridgehead carbons each lose a bromide and a hydrogen, maybe forming a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed in diamondoid structures because of Bredt's rule. So, maybe that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the elimination isn't between the two bromines but leads to the formation of a ketone elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening reaction, but I don't think that's the case with adamantane.

Hold on, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming an enol, but that would require an acidic α-hydrogen, which adamantane doesn't have. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a rearrangement. Wait, maybe the reaction is a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's usually for carbocation shifts.

Wait, another angle. The NMR spectrum of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H, probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom or in an ether linkage?), and 1.94 ppm (2H, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl). Also, 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H)—this is a lot of H's, probably from bridgehead or CH2 groups in the adamantane structure.

But the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 must be a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless it's dehydrohalogenation leading to a conjugated diene, which could undergo further reaction. But under what conditions?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but with the formation of a ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But with two carbonyl groups, the IR would show two peaks or a strong peak. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing a rearrangement to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, and adjacent hydroxyl groups lose water to form a carbonyl. Wait, that's a possibility. So, if each Br is replaced by -OH, then two adjacent -OH groups would lose water to form a carbonyl. But wait, that would require two substitution reactions, each releasing HBr, and then the two adjacent -OH groups would eliminate water, forming a carbonyl.

So, the process would be:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (two substitutions) → 1,3-bis(hydroxyl)adamantane → (dehydration) → 1,3-diketone?

Wait, but 1,3-diketone would imply two ketone groups on adjacent carbons, which isn't feasible because the molecule is rigid. Alternatively, perhaps a conjugated dienone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution leads to one OH group, which then eliminates with another H to form a carbonyl. Wait, but with two Br's, perhaps both are replaced, leading to two OH groups which then dehydrate to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, for example, if in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is replaced by an OH group (product would be 1,3-diol), and then under basic conditions, the diol could lose water to form a carbonyl.

But wait, I'm not sure if that dehydration would lead to a ketone or an aldehyde. Considering the structure of adamantane, the diol would be on adjacent bridgehead carbons, which when dehydrated would form a conjugated carbonyl group.

So, product 1 would be a diketone. But the IR shows a single peak at 1720, which is typical for a ketone. So maybe it's only one ketone group? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a single elimination. Wait, maybe a single Br is eliminated, but that doesn't explain the strong carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe one Br is replaced by an O- group, and the other is eliminated as Br- with a hydrogen, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a single substitution leading to a bromide and an adjacent OH, which then eliminates to form a carbonyl. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a neighboring group effect. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the elimination leads to a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about possible products. If the initial molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and each Br is on adjacent bridgehead carbons, elimination would form a double bond between them. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to Bredt's rule, so instead, maybe it's a ring expansion or something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl group via a neighboring group mechanism. Let me think: if one Br leaves as Br-, the base abstracts a β hydrogen, leading to a carbocation, which then forms a carbonyl via a hydride shift or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes the formation of an oxonium ion, which then leads to a carbonyl.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think about the NMR data.

In product 1, the NMR shows 4.79 ppm as a 2H triplet. That might be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. But wait, IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone. But in the case of a ketone, the adjacent CH2 might be around 2.1-2.4 ppm. Hmm, but in the data, the 2.41-2.23 region is a multiplet for 10H, which probably corresponds to bridgehead CH2 groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be CH2 groups next to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm peak is for an oxygen-bearing CH2 group. If the product is an alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Wait, another thought: maybe the product is an epoxide. But the IR of an epoxide doesn't have a strong carbonyl peak. So that can't be.

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 1 is a ketone, and the NMR shows the CH2 that's adjacent to the carbonyl. The 4.79 ppm is a bit high for a simple CH2 next to a ketone. Maybe it's an oxygenated CH2, like an ether or an ester.

But wait, the IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So, if the product has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a ketone. So, maybe the structure is such that two Brs are replaced by an O-containing group.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. So, for example, the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and an H to form a carbonyl group. That would give a diketone, but I'm not sure if that's possible in adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the Brs is replaced by a hydroxyl group, which then loses a proton to form a carbonyl. But that would require the other Br to leave as well.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the NMR shows the adjacent CH2 groups. So, the 4.79 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, but then I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring or something else, but I'm not seeing it.

Let me rethink the reaction. Heating with KOH could be a dehydrohalogenation, but bridgehead double bonds are not allowed. So perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl group through elimination. Maybe the two Brs are eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond via a conjugated system, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution to form a diol, which then undergoes oxidation. But KOH isn't oxidizing, but maybe in the presence of another reagent, but the problem says KOH is the only reagent.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol that loses water to form a carbonyl. So, 1,3-diol → (dehydration) → ketone.

But how does that happen? The diol would have adjacent OH groups. Dehydration of a diol can form a carbonyl, but that usually requires an acid catalyst. Under basic conditions, perhaps it's not favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates the diol, leading to elimination of water and forming a carbonyl.

Wait, that makes sense. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH in a substitution to form 1,3-diol. Then, under basic conditions, the diol loses water to form a ketone.

So, the product would be a diketone. But the NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which doesn't fit a diketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps only one substitution occurs, leading to a bromide and an adjacent hydroxyl group. Then, elimination would form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a single elimination. Let's say one Br leaves as Br- and the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to a double bond. But if bridgehead double bonds are not allowed, perhaps the molecule rearranges.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl via a conjugated mechanism. For example, the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, leading to a double bond, but since the bridgehead can't have a double bond, a shift occurs, forming a carbonyl group.

So, the product might be a ketone. Let me imagine: the base abstracts a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond, but due to the structure, it's not possible, so a carbonyl forms instead.

Wait, that could explain the IR. So, product 1 is a ketone.

Now, looking at the NMR: the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, perhaps oxygen. But in a ketone, the adjacent CH2 would be around 2.1-2.3 ppm. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, the 4.79 could be an OCH2 group, like in an ether or an ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong, so likely a ketone. So, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm is
