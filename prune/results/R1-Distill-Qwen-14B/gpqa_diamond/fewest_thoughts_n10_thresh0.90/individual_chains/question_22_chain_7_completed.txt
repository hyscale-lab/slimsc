Okay, so I have this question about electrochemistry, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let me think through it.

The question is about how oxygen behaves as an oxidant in different solutions. The statement is split into two parts: one about thermodynamics in basic solutions and the other about kinetics in acidic solutions. I need to figure out the correct terms for each blank.

First, I remember that in electrochemistry, whether a substance is a good oxidant depends on its standard reduction potential. If the potential is higher, it's a stronger oxidant.

So, for the first part, "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." I think about the standard reduction potentials. In basic conditions, the reaction for oxygen is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^- with a standard E° of around +0.401 V. But wait, wait, actually I think in acidic conditions, O2's reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O with E° of about +1.23 V. Oh, wait no, wait. Wait, in basic solutions, the E° is lower than in acidic because H+ concentration is lower. Because in basic, H+ is less, but OH- is more.

Wait, the standard E° for O2 as an oxidizer is higher in acidic. Because in acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, and the E° is about +1.23 V. In basic, it's O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-, and the E° is about +0.401 V. So, in basic solution, the E° is lower, meaning that O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic compared to acidic conditions. Oh wait, no, wait. Because higher E° means it's a better oxidant. So in basic, E° is 0.401 vs 1.23 in acidic. So in basic, it's a weaker oxidant. So first blank is "weaker".

Wait, but the question says "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So compared to acidic, it's weaker. So first part is weaker.

Now the second part: "Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." Kinetics relates to reaction rates. So the reaction's rate depends on factors like concentration, catalysts, and activation energy. In acidic solutions, does O2 react faster or slower?

Wait, O2's reaction in solution—like in the air—might be slower because O2 is not very soluble in water. But in acidic conditions, maybe the solubility changes? Hmm, the solubility of O2 in water is actually higher in more acidic solutions because of the lower pH. Wait, no, wait. Solubility of gases in liquid depends on the partial pressure and the Henry's law. But wait, for O2, which is sparingly soluble, the solubility is higher in cold water. But in terms of acidic vs basic, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about the reaction rate: the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O. The reaction rate in acidic solution might be faster because the H+ ions can act as catalysts, or perhaps the reaction pathway is more favorable. But wait, activation energy is a kinetic factor. If the reaction is more kinetically favorable, it would proceed faster.

Wait, but if O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic (higher E°), that's thermodynamic. But for kinetics, the activation energy matters. For redox reactions, the presence of H+ ions might increase the reaction rate because they can help in the protonation steps. So in acidic solution, the reaction might proceed faster because the H+ ions facilitate the reaction steps, lowering the activation energy and making the reaction kinetically faster.

Wait, but another angle: the reaction of O2 is often slower because O2 is not a very reactive oxidizing agent. But when conditions are more favorable, like in acidic, maybe the reaction is faster. For example, in the oxygen reduction reaction, in acidic conditions, the reaction rate can be influenced by the concentration of H+.

Alternatively, if the question is comparing the kinetic rates in acidic vs basic solutions, which one is faster. I think in acidic solutions, the reaction is kinetically faster because the H+ ions help in the reaction steps. So in acidic, the reaction is faster.

Wait, but then the statement says "kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." So the blank is about how fast it reacts. If it's faster, then the second part is "faster".

So putting it together: the first blank is 'weaker' because in basic, E° is lower, so weaker oxidant. The second blank is 'faster' because acidic conditions might make the reaction proceed more quickly.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

In thermodynamic terms: if E° is higher, it's a stronger oxidant. So in basic, E° is lower, so weaker oxidant. So first part is weaker.

In kinetic terms, acidity can affect reaction rates. For example, in an acidic solution, H+ ions can act as catalysts, perhaps making the reaction happen more quickly. So oxygen might react faster in acidic solutions because of the H+ ions assisting the reaction.

So the second blank is 'faster'.

So the first blank is 'weaker' and the second is 'faster'. Looking at the options, which option has weaker and faster? Option C is weaker - faster. Option C is option C) weaker – faster.

Wait, looking at the options:

Options:
A) stronger – faster
B) stronger – slower
C) weaker – faster
D) weaker - slower

So the correct combination is weaker and faster, which is option C.


Thermodynamically, the strength of an oxidant is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). In acidic solutions, the reduction potential of oxygen (O₂) is higher (+1.23 V) compared to its potential in basic solutions (+0.401 V). This indicates that oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions and a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Therefore, the first blank should be filled with "weaker."

Kinetically, the reaction rate depends on factors such as the presence of catalysts and the reaction environment. In acidic solutions, the higher concentration of H⁺ ions can facilitate the reduction of oxygen by acting as catalysts, lowering the activation energy and making the reaction proceed more quickly. Thus, the second blank should be filled with "faster."

Combining these observations, the correct answer is "weaker – faster," which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
