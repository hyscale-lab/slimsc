Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and some spots on it. The problem is comparing the brightness variation caused by these spots to the variation that would be caused by an exoplanet. I need to find the radius of such a planet relative to the star.

Hmm, let me break down the given data. The star's radius is equal to the Sun's. I know the Sun's radius is about 7e5 km, but maybe I don't need the exact value right away. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%. Oh, wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered by spots, right? So 20% means 0.2 of the star's surface is spots.

Each spot is cooler than the surrounding photosphere by 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K. Because the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spots are 1000 K cooler.

The issue is that when the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view from our perspective. So the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of the visible hemisphere. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block some of the light, causing a dip in brightness. The question is asking what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

So I need to calculate the relative brightness change (delta F) caused by the spots and compare it to the change caused by a planet transit, then find the planet radius that gives the same delta F.

Wait, but when the spots rotate, the brightness change is due to both the spots being cooler and the fact that they're moving in and out of view. Let me think: when a spot comes into view, it's a darker area, so the total brightness decreases. Similarly, when the spot is on the far side, it's not visible, so brightness is higher. But the question says that the star's brightness variations would resemble an exoplanet, so we're comparing the two effects.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness variation (due to spots) would produce the same amplitude as a planet. So I need to find the planet radius Rpl such that when it transits, the dip is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

So to find Rpl, I can compare the fractional change in brightness caused by the planet transit to that caused by the spots.

First, I'll calculate the fractional brightness change due to the spots. Then, I'll set the planet transit's fractional change equal to that and solve for Rpl/Rstar.

Wait, but how does the spot temperature affect the brightness? Because the spots are cooler, when they are on the visible side, the star emits less light. So the fractional change in brightness would depend on the temperature difference and the area of the spots.

But wait, for a star with spots, the total emitted flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. The flux from each part depends on their area and temperature.

Flux from the star without spots: F0 = σTeff^4 * 4πRstar^2 / (4πD^2) ) [Wait, actually, when considering the total flux, the 4π cancels out, so F0 = σ T^4 * (Rstar^2) / D^2, where D is the distance to us. But since we're looking for relative changes, perhaps the distance D will cancel out. So maybe I can ignore D for now.

When a spot is visible, the flux from that area is F_spot = σ (T_spot)^4 * A_spot / (4π D^2 ). The area A_spot is the area of the spot, which is the filling factor times the total surface area of the star. Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so the total spotted area is 0.2 * 4π Rstar^2.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. But since it's one hemisphere, perhaps the spots are all on one side. So when the star rotates, the spots rotate into and out of our line of sight.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to model the star as having a certain fraction of its surface covered by cooler spots. When the star rotates, the fraction of spots visible changes, leading to variation in the observed flux.

Wait, no. Wait, for a star viewed from Earth, the spots are on one hemisphere, but as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of the visible area. So the maximum effect is when the entire spot area is visible, and the minimum is when none are visible. But since the star is rotating, the spots would go from being fully visible to not visible over a rotation period. But perhaps the variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness has periodic variations due to rotational modulation. So like, when the spots are on the leading limb, maximum effect, and when they're on the far side, no effect.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex situation, but for the amplitude, perhaps the maximum change in flux occurs when the spots are either fully entering or exiting the field of view.

Wait, but perhaps I should model the star's flux as a combination of unspotted and spotted regions. So the total flux when a fraction f of the spots is visible is F = F_unspotted + F_spotted_visible.

Wait, but the filling factor is 0.2, meaning that 20% of the surface is spots. So when the star is viewed such that all the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the flux would be lower than when no spots are visible.

But wait, no. Because the star's rotation could cause the spots to come into view and then go out of view. So the maximum flux occurs when no spots are visible, and the minimum occurs when all spots are visible. So the amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_max or something like that.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum and minimum fluxes would be when the spots are all on the far side (so F = F_total) and when all spots are on the near side (so F = F_total - delta F), leading to a change in flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the situation is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So in the case where the hemisphere is completely spotted, when the star is viewed face-on, the spots are on the far side and not visible, so F = F0. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the spots are on the near side, so all the spots are visible. So the flux would be lower. But the period of rotation would cause the flux to vary between these two extremes.

So the fractional change in flux (delta F / F0) would be (F_min - F_max)/F_max. Wait, but I think it's (F_max - F_min)/F_max, because F_max is when no spots are visible, and F_min is when all spots are visible. So (F_max - F_min)/F_max is the fractional amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions. So the total flux when a fraction f of the spots are visible is F = F_unspotted * (1 - f) + F_spotted * f, where f is the fraction of the spot area visible.

Wait, no, because f would be 0 when no spots are visible, and 1 when all spots are visible.

Wait, another approach: compute the total flux when a spot is visible and when it's not.

The star's total surface area is 4π Rstar². The spotted area is 0.2 * 4π Rstar². So when all the spots are on the far side, none are visible, so the flux is F0 = σ Teff⁴ (4π Rstar²) / (4π D²) ) = σ Teff^4 Rstar² / D².

When all the spots are on the near side, the flux is F1 = (1 - 0.2) * σ Teff^4 * 4π Rstar² / (4π D²) + 0.2 * σ (Teff - 1000)^4 * 4π Rstar² / (4π D²).

Simplify that: F1 = 0.8 * σ Teff^4 Rstar²/D² + 0.2 σ (5000)^4 Rstar²/D².

So F1 = σ Rstar²/(D²) [ 0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 (5000)^4 ].

We can compute F1 and F0 to find the fractional change.

F0 = σ Rstar^2/D^2 Teff^4.

So F1 = F0 * [ 0.8 + 0.2 (5000/6000)^4 ].

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.2 * 0.482253 ≈ 0.09645.

So F1 = F0 * [0.8 + 0.09645] = F0 * 0.89645.

So the change in flux is Delta F = F0 - F1 = F0 (1 - 0.89645) = F0 * 0.10355.

The amplitude of the variation would be Delta F / F0 = 0.10355, about 10.355%.

Wait, but wait. When the star rotates, the spots come into view, so the flux goes from F0 (no spots visible) to F1 (all spots visible). So the drop is F0 - F1 = 0.10355 F0. So the amplitude is 10.355%.

Wait, but actually, the maximum and minimum flux would be F0 and F1. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F0 - F1)/F0 = 10.355% approximately.

Wait, but the question says that the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as that caused by a planet. So I need to find the planet radius Rpl that would cause a dip of the same amplitude when it transits.

Wait, when a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks a part of the star's light. The dip in flux is (Area of planet / Area of star) * (Teff^4)/(Teff^4) ), assuming the planet is a perfect occulting disk and the star is uniform in brightness. Wait, but the star's brightness is not uniform because of the spots. Oh wait, no, for the planet transit, the star is considered uniform in the calculation. Because the problem says, 'if the star was not covered by spots'—so when calculating the planet's effect, the star is assumed to have uniform brightness.

So the dip in flux when a planet transits is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) because the area blocked is π Rpl^2, and the star's area is π Rstar^2, but since the planet's area is much smaller, the approximation is Rpl^2 / Rstar^2.

But wait, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, since the area is proportional to R².

So the dip amplitude (delta F / F0) for the planet is (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2).

But wait, no, the dip is the fraction of the star's light blocked. So the dip is (Area of planet)/(Area of star) = (π Rpl²) / (π Rstar²) ) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So for the same amplitude as the spots (10.355%), we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, the dip due to the planet is (Rpl^2/Rstar^2). If that dip equals the fractional change from the spots (10.355%), then Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

But looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is about 0.32. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the spot calculation. Let me double-check.

Earlier, I calculated F1 as 0.8 * Teff^4 + 0.2 * (5000)^4. Wait, that's correct because 20% of the area is spots at 5000 K, and 80% is at 6000 K.

So F1 = F0 * (0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4).

Wait, (5000/6000) is 5/6 ≈ 0.8333, and (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.2 * 0.482253 ≈ 0.09645.

0.8 + 0.09645 = 0.89645.

So F1 = 0.89645 F0.

So the drop is F0 - F1 = 0.10355 F0, so 10.355% amplitude.

So for the planet, (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rpl = sqrt(0.10355) Rstar.

sqrt(0.10355) is approximately 0.3218, which is about 0.32. So option D is 0.32.

Wait, but wait, the options are: A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

So the answer would be D) ~0.32.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when the spots are on the star, they cause a dip in brightness as they come into view. But the planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 as well.

Wait, but wait another point: when the star is not covered by spots, the amplitude from the planet is when it transits. But in the problem, the star has spots, but the planet scenario is hypothetical—what if the star wasn't spotted, what planet would cause the same amplitude.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the spot-induced variation to the planet-induced variation. So when the spots are present, the variation is about 10%, so the planet's variation needs to be 10%, so Rpl is about 0.32 Rstar.

So the answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots, we compare the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots to that caused by the planet transit.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20% (\( f = 0.2 \)).
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Planet Properties**:
   - The planet transits the star, blocking a fraction of the star's light proportional to its area.

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \frac{R_{\text{star}}^2}{D^2} \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and \( D \) is the distance to the star.
   - When all spots are visible, the flux is reduced:
     \[
     F_1 = 0.8 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \frac{R_{\text{star}}^2}{D^2} + 0.2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \frac{R_{\text{star}}^2}{D^2}.
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     F_1 = F_0 \cdot \left( 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.482253.
     \]
     \[
     F_1 = F_0 \cdot \left( 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.482253 \right) = F_0 \cdot 0.89645.
     \]
   - The fractional change in brightness is:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355 \, \text{or} \, 10.355\%.
     \]

4. **Planet Transit**:
   - The fractional brightness change due to a planet transit is proportional to the area blocked:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the spot-induced variation:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to option **D**.
