Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that X is a meson resonance. We're supposed to find the mean decay distance, given the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16. Hmm.

I remember that when particles like mesons are produced, their mean lifetime depends on their energy and their decay width. The mean lifetime (or proper lifetime) τ is related to the decay width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, this is the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame. But the problem is probably considering the decay distance in the lab frame where the meson is moving, right?

So the mean decay distance (or proper mean path) would then be the velocity of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, velocity depends on energy. The meson is a boson, I think, so it's a composite particle made of a quark and antiquark. But for the decay distance, I think we can treat it as a relativistic particle.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Find the mean lifetime τ (proper time) of the meson. τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is the width, which is the energy width. So Γ is given in MeV, but ħ is in units of GeV·s or something? Let me recall the constants.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But Γ here is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is about 2.0569e-24 seconds. Wait, no: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.0569e-24 s. Because 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.568, but then times 1e-25 gives 2.0568e-24 s.

2. Now, the mean decay distance is the speed of the meson multiplied by τ. But wait, the speed depends on the energy and mass. The meson is moving at some relativistic speed since its production energy is 8 GeV, which is higher than its rest mass (1.2 GeV). So we need to compute the velocity beta (β) times c, then multiply by τ.

So, first, find the relativistic gamma factor. Gamma (γ) is E / (m c²), but since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², units should work out. Wait, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So γ = E_X / m_X = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ is approximately 6.6667.

Then, the velocity beta (β) is sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Wait, that's the formula. So let's compute that.

Compute 1/γ²: (1 / 6.6667)^2 is (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887. So the velocity v is βc ≈ 0.9887 * speed of light.

3. Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ. So L = β c τ.

Putting the numbers in:

β is 0.9887, c is approximately 3e8 m/s, and τ is 2.0569e-24 s.

So L ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 2.0569e-24 s is (3 * 2.0569) * 1e8 * 1e-24 m.

3 * 2.0569 is approximately 6.1707. 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16. So 6.1707e-16 m.

Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.1707e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.106e-16 m.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Hold on, I think I messed up the calculation steps. Let me go back.

Wait, when I compute L = β c τ:

β is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, τ is 2.0569e
