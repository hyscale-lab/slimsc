Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think is lithium-6. Hmm, let me break this down.

Wait, so the question is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases due to relativistic effects. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma times m c squared, right?

First, I need to find the rest mass of the nucleus. Since it's Li with 3 neutrons, the atomic number is 3, and the mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So, it's lithium-6. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. I think the atomic mass includes electrons, but wait, no, because for a nucleus, we're only considering protons and neutrons. So I'll need to calculate the mass based on the number of protons and neutrons.

Each proton has a mass of approximately 938 MeV/c². Same for neutrons, I think they're about the same mass, around 939 MeV/c², but maybe for simplicity, we can approximate them as 938 each. So for lithium-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me calculate that.

3 * 938 + 3 * 938 = 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Wait, but that's the total for the nucleus. Oh, wait, that's the rest mass energy in MeV. But I think the actual mass is a bit less because when you form a nucleus, some mass is converted into binding energy. Oh right! So the actual rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons. Hmm, but wait, maybe the problem expects me to ignore that and use the sum of the masses since it's a common approximation. Or perhaps I should look up the exact atomic mass of lithium-6.

I remember that the exact atomic mass (including electrons) of lithium-6 is about 6.0160293 u. Oh wait, but I'm only interested in the nucleus. So the atomic mass includes electrons. Let me think: a lithium atom has 3 electrons, each with mass about 0.00054858 u. So the mass of the nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

So, atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0160293 u. Minus 3 * 0.00054858 u. Let me compute that.

3 * 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 u. So the nucleus mass M is 6.0160293 - 0.00164574 = 6.01438356 u. But wait, wait, that's a bit low. Another thought: perhaps the atomic mass already accounts for the binding energy, so maybe I should just use the atomic mass for the nucleus. No, wait, no. Because the atomic mass includes the electrons as well. So yes, I need to subtract the electrons.

Alternatively, maybe the standard approach is to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But perhaps for this problem, it's easier to use the atomic mass of lithium-6, convert it to MeV/c², and then use that as the rest mass energy.

Wait, let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0160293 u. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. The actual mass of the nucleus is 6.0160293 u. So the difference is 6.047823 - 6.0160293 = 0.0317937 u. That's the binding energy, which is about 0.0317937 u * 931.5 MeV/u = approx 29.52 MeV. But I'm getting a bit off track.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to just calculate the rest mass as the sum of protons and neutrons. But that would be 6.047823 u, which is higher than the actual nucleus mass. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the rest mass is given, but I don't have that data here. Maybe I should proceed by using the atomic mass and subtracting the electrons.

Wait, perhaps I can approach this differently. Since the problem gives me the speed as 0.96c, I can calculate the gamma factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Once I have gamma, I can compute the total relativistic energy as gamma * m c², where m is the rest mass of the nucleus.

But I need the rest mass. So let's compute it in MeV/c².

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0160293 u. One u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the mass of the atom is 6.0160293 * 931.5 MeV/c². But we need only the nucleus, so subtract the electrons. The mass of each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So three electrons would be 0.00164574 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.0160293 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.01438356 u.

So converting that to MeV/c²: 6.01438356 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let me compute that.

6 * 931.5 is 5589, 0.01438356 * 931.5 ≈ approx 13.386. So total is approximately 5602.386 MeV, which is about 5.602386 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately:

6.01438356 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.01438356 * 931.5 = approximately 13.386.

So total is 5589 + 13.386 = 5602.386 MeV, or 5.602386 GeV.

So m c² is about 5.602386 GeV.

Now, when the nucleus is moving at v = 0.96c, the gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714286.

So the total energy is gamma * m c² = 3.5714286 * 5.602386 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714286 * 5.602386 = ?

Breaking it down:

3 * 5.602386 = 16.807158.

0.5714286 *5.602386 ≈ Let me compute 0.5 *5.602386 = 2.801193; 0.0714286 *5.602386 ≈ 0.4016. So total about 2.801193 + 0.4016 = 3.2028.

So 16.807158 + 3.2028 ≈ 20.01 GeV.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me do a more precise calculation.

3.5714286 *5.602386:

Compute 3.5714286 *5.602386:

Take 3.5714286 as 25/7, because 25/7 ≈3.5714286. So 25/7 * 5.602386.

5.602386 divided by 7 is approximately 0.80034086.

Multiply by 25: 0.80034086 *25 = 20.0085215.

So approximately 20.0085 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, but wait, wait. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the nucleus mass. Let me double-check.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0160293 u. The number of electrons in a neutral Li atom is 3. Each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So the total mass of the electrons is 3 * 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 u.

So the nucleus mass is 6.0160293 - 0.00164574 = 6.01438356 u.

But wait, another point: the actual mass of the nucleus is calculated as the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the mass defect (binding energy). Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact rest mass in GeV/c².

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact value of the mass of lithium-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron, which is about 1.008664 u each for a proton and 1.008665 u for a neutron. So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be 3*(1.008664 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.017329) = 6.051987 u.

The actual mass of the nucleus is 6.0160293 u (atomic mass minus electrons). So the binding energy is 6.051987 - 6.0160293 = 0.0359577 u. Convert that to MeV: 0.0359577 *931.5 ≈ 33.5 MeV (since 0.0359577 u *931.5 MeV/u = approx 33.5 MeV).

But perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy, and just use the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons. That would give a higher mass, but the problem didn't specify, so maybe that's the approach.

Wait, but the problem is about the rest mass of the nucleus, which is actually less than the sum of the protons and neutrons. So perhaps I should proceed more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximate mass as 6 * 1 GeV/c². Wait, because each nucleon is about 1 GeV/c². So 6 *1 = 6 GeV/c². But wait, no, because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV, so 1 GeV is about 1.07 u. Hmm, perhaps that's complicating.

Wait, maybe I should take the rest mass as approximately 6 GeV/c². Then, gamma is 3.5714, as before. So total energy would be 3.5714 *6 = 21.428 GeV. Which is about 21.428 GeV. Looking at the options, option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, that's close. Option B is 23.069, which is higher.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that the nucleus mass is about 5.6 GeV, leading to an energy of around 20 GeV. But if the rest mass is actually 6 GeV, then the energy is 21.428 GeV, which would match option D.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the nucleus mass. Let me re-calculate that more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 6.01438356 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.01438356 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01438356 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.00438356 *931.5 ≈ 4.081.

So 9.315 +4.081=13.396 MeV.

So total is 5589 +13.396 =5602.396 MeV, which is 5.602396 GeV.

So that's about 5.6024 GeV.

Wait, so back to the gamma calculation.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28= 3.5714286.

So the total energy is gamma * m c² =3.5714286 *5.602396 GeV.

Calculating that:

3.5714286 *5.602396.

Let me compute this precisely.

Let me write 3.5714286 as 25/7 (since 25 ÷7=3.57142857...).

So 25/7 *5.602396.

Compute 5.602396 ÷7 = approximately 0.800342286.

Then multiply by 25: 0.800342286 *25=20.008557 GeV.

So approximately 20.0086 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than my calculation. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of gamma. Let me re-calculate the gamma factor.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96² = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857...

But perhaps using a more precise calculation.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So then the energy is 3.57142857 *5.602396 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Alternative approach: Use the exact mass of the nucleus in MeV.

Wait, perhaps another source says that the mass of the lithium-6 nucleus is 6.0160293 u minus the 3 electrons, which is 6.01438356 u. So 6.01438356 *931.5 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

6.01438356 * 931.5:

6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.01438356 *931.5:

Compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.00438356 *931.5 = let me compute:

0.004 *931.5=3.726.

0.00038356 *931.5 ≈ 0.357.

So 3.726 +0.357=4.083.

So 9.315 +4.083=13.398 MeV.

Total is 5589 +13.398=5602.398 MeV=5.602398 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 * 5.602398 = ?

Let me compute with more precision.

5.602398 *3.57142857.

Let me break it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.602398 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.002398 *3.57142857 ≈0.0085 (approx). So total about 2.14285714 +0.0085=2.151357.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.151357≈20.0085 GeV.

So about 20.0085 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV. But wait, that's 20.132, which is higher than my 20.0085.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me check another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the entire Li-6 atom, including electrons. Because in that case, the mass would be 6.0160293 u *931.5 MeV/u, which is 6.0160293 *931.5 = let's compute that.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.0160293 *931.5 ≈ 14.94.

So total 5589+14.94=5603.94 MeV, which is about 5.60394 GeV.

Wait, but that's including the electrons. So if the problem is considering the entire atom, the rest mass would be higher. But in reality, the RHIC accelerates nuclei, so perhaps the correct approach is to include the electrons.

Wait, but wait. The RHIC accelerates heavy ions, like gold ions. Each ion has a charge and mass, but the rest mass includes the protons, neutrons, and electrons, but wait, in the nucleus, the electrons are bound to the atom, but when you ionize the atom, you lose the electrons. So, perhaps the problem is considering the ion as a bare nucleus, meaning it has lost the electrons.

Wait, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simply uses the mass number as the rest mass, so mass in u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u. So for Li-6, mass number is 6, so 6 *931.5 MeV=5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So if the rest mass is approx 5.589 GeV, then the energy would be gamma times that. Gamma is 3.5714, so 3.5714 *5.589 ≈?

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.5714 *5.589 ≈3.198.

Total approx 16.767 +3.198=20. (19.965 GeV).

Hmm, that's about 19.965 GeV, which is around 20 GeV. But the options don't have exactly 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than this.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: perhaps the problem uses the proton mass as an approximation, but that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the speed and compute gamma more accurately, but in this case, 0.96c gives gamma exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact gamma.

Wait, 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So 1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Now, perhaps the rest mass is different. Let me think: perhaps the problem uses the mass of a Li-6 nucleus as 6.0143836 u, which I calculated earlier. So 6.0143836 *931.5 MeV/u = ?

Let me calculate that precisely.

6.0143836 ×931.5.

Compute 6 ×931.5 =5589.

0.0143836 ×931.5 = 0.0143836 ×931.5.

Compute 0.01 ×931.5 =9.315.

0.0043836 ×931.5 ≈ let's compute:

0.004 ×931.5=3.726.

0.0003836 ×931.5 ≈0.0003836 ×931.5 = approx 0.357.

So 3.726 +0.357=4.083.

So 0.0143836 ×931.5 =9.315 +4.083 =13.398 MeV.

Total is 5589 +13.398=5602.398 MeV =5.602398 GeV.

So the energy is 3.57142857 ×5.602398 GeV.

Let me compute that product more precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.602398.

Using a calculator approach:

5.602398 ×3.57142857.

Let me write 3.57142857 as (25/7).

So 5.602398 /7 = approximately 0.800342571.

Multiply by 25: 0.800342571 ×25=20.00856428 GeV.

So approximately 20.00856 GeV, which is 20.00856 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, my calculation gives about 20.0085 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132), but it's lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of Li-6's atomic mass, including the electrons. Because the problem states that X is a nucleus, which I think is a bare nucleus, so the electrons are not included. So I think my initial calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Wait, another thought: relativistic energy includes the rest mass plus the kinetic energy, but the formula E = gamma m c² is the total energy, including rest mass. So I think I did it right.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use a different approach, like using the relativistic kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Wait, no, because the question says 'the energy of the collider', which I think refers to the total energy, not the kinetic. Because in colliders, the energy given to the particles is their total energy, not just the kinetic.

But wait, just to check: the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So if the problem had asked for the kinetic energy, it would be gamma m c² minus m c squared. But the question is about the energy of the collider, which is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy, i.e., gamma m c².

So I think my calculation is correct.

But then why is the closest option C at 20.132 GeV?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me get the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, from the periodic table, the atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.0160293 u. The number of electrons is 3, each 0.00054858 u. So nucleus mass is 6.0160293 -3*(0.00054858) =6.0160293 -0.00164574 =6.01438356 u.

Wait, but perhaps the actual mass of the nucleus is 6.0160293 u (atomic mass) if it's a bare nucleus? No, the atomic mass includes the electrons. So if the nucleus is bare (like in the collider), the electrons are not present, so the mass is atomic mass minus electrons.

So going back, 6.01438356 u *931.5 MeV/u=5.602398 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for 931.5 MeV/u. Let me check: 1 u = 931.4941 MeV/c². So using 931.4941.

So 6.01438356 * 931.4941 = ?

Let me compute:

6 *931.4941=5588.9646.

0.01438356 *931.4941 = ?

0.01 *931.4941=9.314941.

0.00438356 *931.4941.

Compute 0.004 *931.4941=3.725976.

0.00038356 *931.4941 = approx 0.357.

So total is 3.725976 +0.357≈4.082976.

So 0.01438356 *931.4941≈9.314941 +4.082976≈13.397917.

So total is 5588.9646 +13.397917≈5602.3625 MeV =5.6023625 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.6023625 = ?

Let me compute:

5.6023625 *3.57142857.

As before, 3.57142857 is 25/7, so 5.6023625/7 = approx 0.8003375.

Multiply by 25: 0.8003375 *25=20.0084375 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0084 GeV.

The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So 20.0084 is closest to C)20.132, but it's 0.1236 GeV less. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy formula without considering the exact rest mass and just calculates with m=6 GeV/c².

So let's try that.

If m=6 GeV/c², then gamma=3.57142857.

E=6 *3.57142857 ≈21.42857 GeV.

Which is option D)21.419 GeV. But wait, that's a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the atomic mass without subtracting the electrons.

In that case, the rest mass energy would be 6.0160293 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.0160293 *931.494 ≈14.94 MeV.

So total 5588.964 +14.94=5603.904 MeV=5.603904 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.603904 GeV.

Compute 5.603904 *3.57142857.

Again, 3.57142857 =25/7.

5.603904 /7 =0.8005577.

Multiply by 25: 0.8005577 *25=20.0139425 GeV.

So about 20.0139 GeV.

Which is 20.014, which is closer to option C)20.132 GeV, but still not matching exactly.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Wait, perhaps the nucleus is treated as a point particle with mass equal to the sum of the protons and neutrons, which would be 6*938 MeV=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

E=5.628 *3.57142857 ≈?

5.628 *3.57142857.

5 *3.5714=17.857.

0.628 *3.5714≈2.239.

Total approx 20.096 GeV.

Which is closer to option C: 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, 20.096 GeV is close to 20.132. The difference is about 0.036 GeV, which is 36 MeV. That's within the precision of 1e-4, but the options don't have that exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute with more precise numbers.

Wait, maybe I should not approximate gamma as 3.57142857, but calculate it more accurately.

Wait, v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96²) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

So no error there.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 5.602398 GeV, and the energy is 3.57142857 *5.602398 = ?

Computing this:

5.602398 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.602398.

Breakdown:

3 *5.602398 =16.807194.

0.57142857 *5.602398.

Compute 0.5 *5.602398=2.801199.

0.07142857 *5.602398= approx 0.07142857 *5=0.35714285, 0.07142857 *0.602398≈0.043052.

So total for 0.07142857 *5.602398≈0.35714285 +0.043052≈0.40019485.

So 0.5 part is 2.801199, plus 0.07142857 part 0.40019485, total 3.20139385.

So overall, 16.807194 +3.20139385 =20.00858785 GeV.

So approximately 20.0086 GeV, which is 20.0086 GeV.

The options are:

A) 18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419.

So 20.0086 is closest to option C (20.132), but that's a difference of about 0.1234 GeV, which is 123 MeV. That seems significant. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, but the energy per nucleon is what matters. Wait, no, the problem asks for the energy of the nucleus, not per nucleon.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy correctly, including the rest mass and the kinetic.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for relativistic energy:

E = gamma * m c².

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

According to the table, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0160293 u. The number of electrons is 3, each 0.00054858 u, so nucleus mass is 6.0160293 -3*(0.00054858) =6.0160293 -0.00164574 =6.01438356 u.

So m=6.01438356 u *931.494 MeV/u =5.602398 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.602398=20.008587 GeV.

Hmm. So this is about 20.0086 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but it's not very close. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the rest mass, such as 5.6 GeV, leading to:

E=3.5714 *5.6 =20.0 GeV.

But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. Or perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass as 6 GeV.

E=3.5714 *6=21.4285 GeV.

Which is option D)21.419 GeV. That's very close.

So perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the rest mass as 6 GeV. Therefore, the correct option would be D)21.419 GeV.

But earlier, the precise calculation gives about 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the sum of the protons and neutrons as the rest mass, which is 6 *938 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Then E=3.5714 *5.628=20.096 GeV, which is about 20.1 GeV.

Which would correspond to option C)20.132 GeV.

But I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the actual mass is higher because when I subtracted the electrons, I should have considered the binding energy correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass in a different way. For example, using the average mass of the nucleus as 5.6 GeV, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. At this point, I think I should proceed with the calculation that gives me approximately 20.0086 GeV, which isn't exactly any of the options, but the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass. Let me re-calculate.

6.01438356 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Let me compute this accurately.

6.01438356 ×931.494.

Compute 6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.01438356 *931.494 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.00438356 *931.494.

Compute 0.004 *931.494=3.725976.

0.00038356 *931.494= approx 0.357.

So total is 3.725976 +0.357=4.082976.

So 0.01438356 *931.494=9.31494 +4.082976=13.397916.

So total is 5588.964 +13.397916=5602.361916 MeV=5.602361916 GeV.

So m c²=5.602361916 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.602361916.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.602361916.

Let me write 3.57142857 as 25/7.

So 5.602361916 /7 = 0.8003374166.

Multiply by 25: 0.8003374166 ×25 =20.008435415 GeV.

So approximately 20.0084 GeV.

But none of the options match this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different rest mass, such as 5.6 GeV, leading to E=20 GeV.

But the options don't have 20 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps I should round to four decimal places.

Wait, the calculation gives 20.0084 GeV, which is 20.0084. The options are:

A)18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419.

So 20.0084 is closest to C)20.132, but the difference is about 0.1236 GeV, which is 123.6 MeV. That's a significant difference, suggesting perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the rest mass and use only the kinetic energy. But the question is about the total energy, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the sum of the masses of the nucleons, which is 6 *938 MeV=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628=?

3.57142857 ×5.628.

Compute 3 ×5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 ×5.628.

0.5 ×5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 ×5.628 ≈0.402.

So 2.814 +0.402=3.216.

Total E=16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Which is 20.1 GeV, which is closer to option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, but wait, that's more precise.

Wait, 0.57142857 ×5.628.

Compute 0.57142857 ×5=2.85714285.

0.57142857 ×0.628= approx 0.57142857 ×0.6=0.34285714, plus 0.57142857 ×0.028=0.016.

So total 0.34285714 +0.016=0.35885714.

So 0.57142857 ×5.628=2.85714285 +0.35885714=3.216 GeV.

So total energy is 16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

So about 20.1 GeV, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Rest Mass of the Lithium-6 Nucleus
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.0160293 \, \text{u} \). Since Li-6 has 3 electrons, the mass of the nucleus is calculated by subtracting the mass of 3 electrons from the atomic mass. Each electron has a mass of \( 0.00054858 \, \text{u} \), so:

\[
\text{Mass of 3 electrons} = 3 \times 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 \, \text{u}
\]

\[
\text{Mass of Li-6 nucleus} = 6.0160293 - 0.00164574 = 6.01438356 \, \text{u}
\]

Converting this to MeV/c² using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV/c}^2 \):

\[
m c^2 = 6.01438356 \times 931.494 = 5602.362 \, \text{MeV} = 5.602362 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \). The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5.602362 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.57142857 \times 5.602362 = 20.00856 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the Options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0086 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**.
