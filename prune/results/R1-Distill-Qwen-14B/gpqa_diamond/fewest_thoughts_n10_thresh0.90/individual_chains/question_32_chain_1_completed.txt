Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact calculations. Let me think through this step by step.

The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium usually has 3 protons because its atomic number is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons, so it's lithium-6. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. Wait, but in a collider, are they considering the ions as charged particles? Like, do they mean that the nucleus is moving as a whole, and we're considering its rest mass energy? I think so. So I need to find the total energy of the ion when it's moving at 0.96c.

Wait, the energy in particle physics often refers to the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. So the formula is E = gamma * m_rest * c². But wait, c is a constant, so the rest mass energy is m_rest c², and then multiplied by gamma.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me compute that. Let me calculate v²/c²: (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28 because 0.28² is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714... Wait, wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

But wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 is 7/25, so 25/7 is about 3.5714. So gamma is approx 3.5714. But to be precise, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me recalculate v²/c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/(0.28) = 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 ion. The rest mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for one proton or neutron, it's roughly 938 MeV. So for a Li-6 nucleus with 6 nucleons, the rest mass would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that accurate? Because in reality, the binding energy of the nucleus reduces the total mass. So the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons. Oh right! Because when nucleons bind together, they release energy, so the mass is lower by the binding energy. So I can't just take 6 * 938 MeV; that would overestimate the rest mass of the Li-6 ion.

Hmm, but wait, is that actually necessary here? Or does the problem assume that the nucleus is treated as a single particle with rest mass equal to the sum of its nucleon masses? Because in particle physics, when dealing with heavy ions, sometimes the rest mass is approximated as the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Maybe I should proceed with that assumption unless the problem gives more data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the actual mass of Li-6. Let me think. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.0141 g/mol. Wait, wait, that's grams per mole. So the molar mass is approximately 6.0141 g/mol. Wait, but the molar mass is the mass of one mole of atoms. So one mole has Avogadro's number (~6.022e23) atoms. So the mass per atom would be 6.0141 g/mol divided by 6.022e23 atoms/mol, giving something like ~9.988e-24 grams per atom.

Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the mass of a nucleus is given by the mass number times the mass of a nucleon, minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But I'm not sure of the exact binding energy for Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus as 6 nucleons, each with 938 MeV, so 6 * 0.938 GeV = 5.628 GeV. But actually, the exact rest mass of Li-6 is about 5.62 GeV/c². Wait, let me think again. Let me check some data.

Wait, wait, I think the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 5.62 GeV/c². Because each nucleon is about 0.938 GeV/c², so 6 * 0.938 is 5.628 GeV. But considering binding energy, the actual mass is a bit lower. So maybe about 5.62 GeV. Hmm, but perhaps I should proceed with the approximation because the problem doesn't give exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass as the sum of the individual nucleon masses (i.e., 6 * 938 MeV). Let's proceed with that. So m_rest is 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait another thought: in reality, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually 5.62 GeV/c². Because the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So let's compute the exact mass for Li-6.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = ?

Calculating:

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV

3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV

Total = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV = 5.6335 GeV.

But wait, that's the sum before considering binding energy. The actual mass of Li-6 is lower. The binding energy is about 5.6335 GeV minus the actual mass.

Wait, no, the binding energy is the energy released when the nucleus forms, so the mass is the sum of nucleons' masses minus the binding energy divided by c². So the actual mass of Li-6 is about (sum) minus (binding energy) / c².

But I don't have the exact binding energy for Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the nucleus is a single particle without considering binding energy. So perhaps using m_rest as 6 * 938 MeV is acceptable for this problem.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. The rest mass energy can be found using the atomic mass. For example, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So m_rest = 6.0141 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u.

Calculating:

6.0141 * 931.5 ≈ Let's compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, 0.0141 * 931.5 ≈ 13.15 MeV. So total is 5589 + 13.15 = 5602.15 MeV ≈ 5.602 GeV.

So m_rest is about 5.602 GeV.

But wait, that's the mass of the entire Li atom, including electrons. Oh wait, no, because when the nucleus is moving in the collider, it's usually the bare nucleus, not the atom. Because when ions collide, they're typically bare nuclei (stripped of electrons). So, the mass is that of the nucleus plus the electrons, but if we're considering the nucleus alone, perhaps we should subtract the electrons' mass.

Wait, but Li-6 as an ion in the collider would have a charge. For example, a fully ionized Li-6 would have a +3 charge, meaning it has lost all three electrons. So the mass of the ion would be the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons that are stripped off. Wait, no, that's not correct. When you ionize an atom, you remove electrons, so the ion's mass is just the nucleus's mass. Because the electrons are not part of the ion once they're removed.

So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 5.602 GeV/c². Because the atomic mass is 6.0141 u, but that includes electrons. So for the nucleus, we subtract the electrons' mass.

Wait, but how many electrons? A neutral Li atom has 3 electrons. So if it's a +3 ion, it has lost all three electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is 6.0141 u minus 3*(electron mass).

Electron mass is about 0.00054858 u each. So 3 electrons are 0.0016457 u.

So the nucleus mass is 6.0141 - 0.0016457 = 6.0124543 u.

Then, converting to GeV: 6.0124543 u * 931.5 MeV/u = Let's compute that.

First, 6 u is 5589 MeV (as before). 0.0124543 u times 931.5 MeV/u is:

0.0124543 * 931.5 ≈ Let's compute:

0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315 MeV

0.0024543 * 931.5 ≈ approx 2.284 MeV

So total is approximately 9.315 + 2.284 = 11.599 MeV. So 5589 + 11.599 = 5600.599 MeV, which is about 5.6006 GeV.

So the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 5.6006 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated as 6 nucleons each at 938 MeV, I got 5.628 GeV. But with the actual calculation, it's about 5.6006 GeV. So which one do I use?

I think the problem expects me to calculate using the exact rest mass. But since the problem gives options in the range of 18-23 GeV, perhaps I should proceed with the rest mass as 5.60 GeV, and then multiply by gamma.

So let's proceed.

So, E = gamma * m_rest c².

Gamma is approximately 3.5714, m_rest c² is about 5.6006 GeV.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.6006 GeV.

Let's compute that.

3.5714 * 5.6006 ≈ Let me compute 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857, 3.5714 * 0.6006 ≈ ~2.146. So total is 17.857 + 2.146 ≈ 19.003 GeV.

Hmm, but looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, option B is 23.069, D is 21.419, and A is 18.475 GeV.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 19 GeV, but none of the options match exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute (0.96)^2: 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the rest mass isn't 5.60 GeV. Maybe I should use 6 * 938 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Let me recalculate with m_rest = 5.628 GeV.

E = 3.5714 * 5.628 ≈ ?

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857

3.5714 * 0.628 ≈ Let's compute:

3.5714 * 0.6 is 2.14284.

3.5714 * 0.028 is 0.0999992.

Total for 0.628: 2.14284 + 0.0999992 ≈ 2.2428.

So total E is 17.857 + 2.2428 ≈ 20.1 GeV.

Ah, that's one of the options: option C is 20.132 GeV.

So maybe using the rest mass of 5.628 GeV would give the correct option.

But wait, the actual rest mass is about 5.6 GeV, so perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of the nucleon masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute gamma as a more precise value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

Compute v²/c² = 0.96² = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So gamma is exactly 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, maybe I can compute 25/7 * 5.628 GeV.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 25/7 * 5.628 = ?

Let me compute 5.628 * 25 = 140.7.

140.7 /7 = 20.1.

So that's 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close.

So I think that's the correct approach.

But wait, another thing: when we're talking about the energy in a collider, are we considering each beam's energy as the total energy per particle, or is it the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy?

Wait, in colliders, the energy is usually given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Wait, no, in high-energy physics, the energy of the beam is usually the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy.

So in this case, the question is about the energy of the RHIC, which is the total energy each nucleus has when moving at 0.96c.

So gamma times rest mass energy.

So with m_rest = 5.628 GeV, gamma =3.5714, the energy is 20.1 GeV, which aligns with option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why is option B 23 GeV? Let me check the m_rest again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually given as approximately 5.62 GeV/c². Because I recall that the mass of deuterium (2 nucleons) is about 2.014 GeV/c², and for helium-4, it's about 4.0026 GeV/c². So Li-6 would be around 6 * 0.938 = 5.628 GeV, but with binding energy subtracted, so maybe 5.62 GeV.

Wait, but in any case, let me proceed with the calculation using m_rest =5.62 GeV.

So 5.62 * (25/7) = 5.62 * 3.5714 ≈ 20.096 GeV, which would round to 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options:

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, 20.132 is exactly 20.132, which is about 0.032 GeV higher than 20.1. So perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

Wait, but perhaps considering relativistic terms more accurately.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Oh wait! The problem says "the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." But in a collider, the ions are moving in opposite directions, so the total energy is per beam. Wait, but the question is about the energy of the RHIC, which is the total energy per ion.

So the calculation I did should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact product.

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5.62 GeV.

3.57142857 * 5.62:

Compute 3 *5.62 = 16.86

0.57142857 *5.62.

0.5 *5.62 = 2.81

0.07142857 *5.62 ≈ 0.404 (since 0.07 *5.62=0.3934, 0.00142857 *5.62≈0.007999, so total≈0.3934 +0.007999= 0.4014)

So 2.81 + 0.4014 ≈ 3.2114.

So total is 16.86 +3.2114 ≈ 20.0714 GeV.

Which is about 20.07 GeV, which is close to option C's 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, but there's a discrepancy. Maybe the rest mass is higher.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 5.63 GeV.

Let me try 5.63 *3.5714.

5 *3.5714=17.857

0.63 *3.5714 ≈ 2.246.

Total ≈ 20.103 GeV.

Which is closer to 20.132.

Wait, 5.63 *3.5714 = ?

3.5714 *5.63: Let me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857, 3.5714 *0.63= approx 2.246. So total 20.103.

Which is about 20.103 GeV. So option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps the rest mass is a bit higher than 5.63 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use the precise atomic mass of Li-6.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0141 u. But that's for the atom, including electrons.

As I calculated earlier, the nucleus's mass is 6.0141 u - 3 * (electron mass).

Electron mass is about 0.00054858 u.

So 3 electrons: 3 * 0.00054858 = 0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.0141 - 0.00164574 =6.01245426 u.

Now, 1 u = 931.494064 MeV/c².

So m_rest c² =6.01245426 u *931.494064 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute:

6 u *931.494064 MeV/u = 5588.96438 MeV.

0.01245426 u *931.494064 MeV/u ≈ 11.599 MeV.

So total is 5588.96438 + 11.599 ≈ 5600.563 MeV, which is 5.600563 GeV.

So m_rest c² is approximately 5.600563 GeV.

So with gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.600563 ≈ Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600563 ≈ Let me compute:

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.14285714

3.57142857 *0.000563 ≈ 0.0020179.

So 2.14285714 +0.0020179=2.144875.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 + 2.144875 ≈20.00201785 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.002 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit lower. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma =1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 5.600563 GeV. So the calculation is 3.57142857 *5.600563.

Let me compute this exactly:

3.57142857 *5.600563.

Hmm, breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.600563 ≈ Let's compute 0.600563 as (0.6 + 0.000563).

So 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.000563 = approx 0.0020179.

Adding them gives 2.14487504.

So total E=17.85714285 + 2.14487504 =20.00201789 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.002 GeV.

But the options provided don't have 20.002 GeV; the closest is option C at 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact value of the atomic mass of Li-6.

Let me look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6. Oh wait, I can't access external data, but I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014142 u.

So m_rest of the nucleus would be 6.014142 u (Li-6) minus 3 * (electron mass).

Electron mass is 0.00054858 u.

So 3 electrons: 0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass: 6.014142 - 0.00164574 =6.01249626 u.

Now, 6.01249626 u * 931.494 MeV/u = 6.01249626 *931.494 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

6 *931.494=5588.964

0.01249626 *931.494 ≈ 0.01249626 *931.494.

Hmm, 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.00249626 *931.494 ≈ approximately 2.3263.

So total is 9.31494 +2.3263 =11.64124.

So m_rest c² =5588.964 +11.64124 ≈5600.605 MeV ≈5.600605 GeV.

So, using this more precise m_rest, E=gamma * m_rest c²=3.57142857 *5.600605.

Let me compute that accurately:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.600605 =?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714

3.57142857 *0.000605 =0.002160.

So 2.14285714 +0.002160=2.14501714.

Adding to 17.85714285, total E≈17.85714285 +2.14501714=20.00216 GeV.

Hmm, that's still about 20.002 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.13 GeV higher. So where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question states that the energy is that of the RHIC, which is a collider. So perhaps the energy per beam is given, and the total center-of-mass energy is higher. Wait, no, the question asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So each nucleus must have energy E = gamma m c².

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy only. But in high-energy physics, the energy usually refers to the total energy, not just kinetic.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the kinetic energy and then add the rest mass energy. No, the total energy is gamma times m_rest c².

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 because there are two beams. No, the question is about the energy of each nucleus, not the total in the collider.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different value for the speed. Let me double-check the speed.

v =0.96c. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute gamma as a more precise value.

Wait, let me compute gamma using more precise calculation.

v=0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma =1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So, that's exact.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using a different rest mass. Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is 5.628 GeV (6 *938 MeV) without considering binding energy.

So, 5.628 GeV *3.57142857= 5.628 *3.57142857.

Let me compute that:

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.628 *3.57142857= Let me compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714, 0.028*3.57142857≈0.100.

So, 2.14285714 +0.100= 2.24285714.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.24285714=20.1 GeV.

So that gives exactly 20.1 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.032 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 5.63 GeV.

So 5.63 *3.57142857 = ?

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.63 *3.57142857= 2.24642857.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.24642857=20.10357 GeV.

Which is 20.10357 GeV, which is about 20.104 GeV.

Closer to 20.103, but option C is 20.132, which is 0.029 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma as 25/7 exactly, which is 3.571428571428571...

And rest mass as 5.628 GeV.

So 25/7 *5.628 = ?

25/7 *5.628 = (25 *5.628)/7 = (140.7)/7 =20.1 GeV.

Which is exactly option C if it's 20.132. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 5.628 GeV/c².

Wait, 5.628 GeV * (25/7) =5.628 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.628 *3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.628 *3.57142857 = ?

0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.028 *3.57142857≈0.100.

So 2.14285714 +0.100=2.24285714.

So 17.85714285 +2.24285714=20.1.

Hmm, so that's 20.1 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise steps.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator to compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571...

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the exact figure, considering all decimal places.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 5.628 GeV.

gamma=3.57142857...

So, 5.628 *3.57142857 = ?

Let me compute this as 5.628 * (25/7) = (5.628 *25)/7.

5.628 *25 =140.7.

140.7 /7=20.1.

So exactly 20.1 GeV.

So, given the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me try using 5.63 GeV.

5.63 *3.57142857= 5.63 *25/7.

5.63 *25=140.75.

140.75/7=20.107142857 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.107 GeV, which is still not matching option C.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use beta = 0.96, and compute gamma as 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96²)).

Wait, but I did that.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is given as 5.62 GeV.

Wait, I think the confusion arises because the problem expects me to use the sum of the nucleons' masses, i.e., 6 *938 MeV =5.628 GeV. Then gamma * m_rest=3.5714 *5.628=20.1 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 5.628 *3.57142857.

5.628 *3.57142857 = ?

Let me compute 5.628 *3 =16.884.

5.628 *0.57142857.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628= approximately 0.404.

So 2.814 +0.404=3.218.

So total is 16.884 +3.218=20.102 GeV.

Which is about 20.102 GeV. The option C is 20.132, which is 0.03 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done with more precise values.

Let me compute 5.628 *3.571428571428571.

Let me compute 5.628 * 3.571428571428571.

Breaking it down:

3.571428571428571 = 25/7.

So 5.628 *25/7.

25 *5.628 =140.7.

140.7 /7=20.1.

So exactly 20.1 GeV.

So perhaps the correct answer is 20.1 GeV, which aligns with option C (20.132) because perhaps the rest mass was taken as 5.6283 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 5.628 GeV * 3.57142857 with more precision.

Let me compute 5.628 * 3.57142857.

5.628 *3 =16.884.

5.628 *0.57142857.

Compute 0.57142857 = 4/7.

So 5.628 *4/7 = (5.628 *4)/7 =22.512 /7=3.216.

So 16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

So the precise calculation with m_rest=5.628 GeV gives E=20.1 GeV.

Looking back at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So 20.1 GeV is closest to option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. The mass of Li-6 is 5.628 GeV/c² (using 6 * nucleon mass). Then, the energy is gamma * m_rest c²=3.5714 *5.628=20.1 GeV.

But the option doesn't have 20.1, it's option C at 20.132.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ion as a charge, so the mass is that of the nucleus plus the electrons. But no, earlier I thought that the ion is the bare nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of m_rest c² for Li-6.

Wait, I found earlier that m_rest c² is about 5.600563 GeV. If I use that:

5.600563 *3.57142857= ?

Let me compute that.

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.600563 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.000563 *3.57142857≈0.0020179.

So 2.14285714 +0.0020179=2.144875.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.144875=20.00201785 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.002 GeV.

But that's not matching any option except if I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m_rest c².

But the question is about the total energy, which is gamma m_rest c².

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use the rest mass as 5.628 GeV, leading to E=20.1 GeV, and then option C is the closest, but it's 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the initial assumption about the rest mass is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is not Li-6 but something else. Wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li has 3 protons, so 3 protons +3 neutrons is Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should reconfirm the atomic mass.

Another approach: The mass of Li-6 isotope is approximately 5.62 GeV/c².

So, using that, E=5.62 *3.57142857 =20.002 GeV.

But no option matches this exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as 0.96c, but beta is 0.96, and gamma is 3.0414... Wait, wait, no, no. Wait, no, because beta is 0.96, so gamma is 3.5714...

Wait, could I have mixed up beta and gamma somewhere?

No, I think I did it right.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula but with the rest mass energy in different units.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the rest mass.

Wait, 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c².

So, if the nucleus's mass is 5.600563 GeV.

Wait, 5.600563 GeV *3.57142857=20.002 GeV.

But none of the options match.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, so beta=0.96.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, but the calculation gives 20.1 GeV, and option C is 20.132 GeV. Close enough considering possible rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done with higher precision.

Let me compute 5.628 GeV *3.571428571428571 GeV.

5.628 *3.571428571428571.

Compute 5.628 *3=16.884.

5.628 *0.571428571428571.

0.571428571428571 is 4/7.

So 5.628 *4/7 = (5.628 *4)/7 =22.512/7=3.216.

So 16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

So the precise calculation gives exactly 20.1 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but beta is 0.96, so gamma is 3.57142857.

Another thought: perhaps the ion's charge affects the mass. But in this case, the charge doesn't impact the mass; it affects the electric potential, not the mass.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, assuming that the rest mass is 5.628 GeV and gamma is 3.57142857.

Wait, 5.628 *3.57142857=20.1 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.032 GeV higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is 5.63 GeV.

5.63 *3.57142857=20.10357 GeV.

Which is 20.10357 GeV, which is 20.104 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy as E = gamma * m_nucleon * A, where A is the mass number.

So, m_nucleon is approximately 938 MeV.

So E = gamma * A * m_nucleon.

A is 6, so 6 *938 =5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714.

E=3.5714 *5.628=20.1 GeV.

So, the correct answer is 20.1 GeV. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Perhaps the calculation includes more precise values for gamma and m_rest.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for beta and gamma.

Wait, beta=0.96.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)=1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, gamma is approximately 3.5714285714.

Wait, perhaps using more precise m_rest.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of the lithium nucleus as 5.628 GeV/c².

So, 5.628 *3.57142857=20.1 GeV.

So, the correct option is C, 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but 20.1 is not that close to 20.132.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to round to four decimal places, so the precise value is 20.10357 GeV, which would round to 20.1036 GeV, but that's not an option.

Wait, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the nucleus is a bare nucleus. Suppose the nucleus is moving with speed 0.96c, and the rest mass is 5.628 GeV. So, E=3.5714 *5.628=20.1 GeV. But the options don't have 20.1; the closest is C:20.132.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact product.

5.628 *3.571428571428571.

Let me compute 5.628 ×3.571428571428571.

3.571428571428571 is 25/7.

So, 5.628 ×25 =140.7.

140.7 /7=20.1.

So it's exactly 20.1.

Hmm, but the option C is 20.132, which suggests that perhaps the rest mass is 5.628 GeV and gamma is 3.571428571428571, giving exactly 20.1 GeV.

So, perhaps the answer should be 20.1 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct option is C: 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of the entire atom, including electrons, which would be 6.014142 u.

So, m_rest c² =6.014142 u *931.5 MeV/u = 6.014142 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that:6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.014142 *931.5= approx 13.18 MeV.

So total is 5602.18 MeV=5.60218 GeV.

So E=gamma * m_rest c²=3.57142857 *5.60218.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60218=?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.00218 *3.57142857≈0.00778.

So 2.14285714 +0.00778=2.15063714.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285+2.15063714=20.00778 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.00778 GeV, which is about 20.008 GeV.

That's still not matching any option except maybe option C.

But perhaps more precise calculation:

3.57142857 *5.60218.

5.60218 *3.57142857.

Compute:

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.60218 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.00218 *3.57142857=0.00778.

So 2.14285714 +0.00778=2.15063714.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.15063714=20.00778 GeV.

Approximately 20.008 GeV.

Hmm, but this approach isn't giving me the option C. So maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, based on m_rest=5.628 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's intended approach is to calculate gamma as 25/7, leading to 20.1 GeV, which isn't an option, but option C is the closest.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Which suggests that the precise calculation leads to that value. So perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 5.628 GeV and gamma is 3.57142857.

So 5.628 ×3.57142857=20.1 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the actual calculation that the options are based on uses a more precise value for gamma.

Wait, perhaps the gamma calculation is being done more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator, gamma is 3.57142857142857142857.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects me to calculate gamma as (1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²))) with precise values.

v=0.96c → v²=0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=3.57142857142857142857.

So no change.

Hmm, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, and perhaps the calculation was done with more precise steps.

So, in conclusion, the energy is approximately 20.1 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_{\text{rest}} c^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy (\( m_{\text{rest}} c^2 \))
The nucleus \( X \) is Li-6, which has a mass number \( A = 6 \) (3 protons and 3 neutrons). The rest mass energy of a single nucleon is approximately \( 938 \, \text{MeV} \). Thus, the total rest mass energy of Li-6 is:

\[
m_{\text{rest}} c^2 = 6 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 5628 \, \text{MeV} = 5.628 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy (\( E \))
Using the formula \( E = \gamma m_{\text{rest}} c^2 \):
\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.628 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking the calculation:
\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857
\]
\[
3.5714 \times 0.628 \approx 2.243
\]
\[
E = 17.857 + 2.243 = 20.1 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated energy is \( 20.1 \, \text{GeV} \), which is close to option \( C \) (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The slight discrepancy may arise from rounding differences or more precise intermediate values used in the problem.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Answer: C}}
\]
