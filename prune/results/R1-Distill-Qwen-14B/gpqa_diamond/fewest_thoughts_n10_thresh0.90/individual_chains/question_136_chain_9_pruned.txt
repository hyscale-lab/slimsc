Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R.

The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r squared. So the magnitude is 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. And I need to find the integral of the divergence of this field over the volume of the sphere.

Wait, I remember from my notes that divergence is related to how a field spreads out or converges. The divergence of a vector field describes its source or sink properties. So, finding the divergence here would tell me something about the field's behavior.

The field is purely radial. So in spherical coordinates, the vector field f(r) can be written as [F(r), 0, 0] in spherical components (radial, azimuthal, polar maybe?), but wait, in spherical coordinates, the components are radial, theta (polar), and phi (azimuthal). But here, the field only has the radial component.

So for a vector field that's purely radial, F(r) = f(r) r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector. The magnitude is 1/r², so F(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

Now, to find the divergence of F. I think the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r). Because the general formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:

∇ · **F** = (1/r²) ∂(r² F_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) [ ∂(F_θ sinθ)/∂θ + ∂F_φ/∂φ ) ]

But since F_θ and F_φ are zero here, the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

So substituting F_r = 1/r². Let's compute that.

So,

∇ · **F** = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ]

= (1/r²) d/dr [ 1 ]

Wait, because r² * (1/r²) is just 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. That would mean the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin. Because as r approaches zero, the field might not behave nicely.

But the problem is asking about the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius R. So ∫ (∇ · **F**) dV.

If the divergence is zero everywhere inside (except perhaps at the origin), then the integral should be zero. But wait, isn't this related to Gauss's Law or something else?

Wait, no. Wait, in physics, I remember that the divergence of a field like the electric field (which is similar, since Coulomb's law is 1/r²) is zero except at the origin where the charge is. So the electric field would have a divergence proportional to
