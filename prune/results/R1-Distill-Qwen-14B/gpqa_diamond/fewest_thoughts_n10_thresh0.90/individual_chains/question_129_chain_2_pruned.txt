Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a reaction scheme involving compounds A to E. The goal is to identify compound E based on the given reactions and hints. There are four options to choose from: A, B, C, or D. Each option is a different cyclic ketone, I think.

First, let me outline the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

I remember that IR peaks around 1700-1750 cm^-1 usually indicate carbonyl groups (C=O). So, compound A likely has a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester or something similar. But the peak is around 1750, which is on the higher side. That might suggest a ketone, as esters and aldehydes can also be in that range, but I'm not too sure.

Now, let's break down each step.

Step 1: A + HCN → B.

HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So, if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. So, A is probably a cyclic ketone. When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with an alcohol and a cyanide group attached to adjacent carbons.

So, A is a cyclic ketone, B is the cyanohydrin.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.

Wait, hydrogenation with palladium usually indicates a catalytic hydrogenation. So, what's in B that can be hydrogenated? B is a cyanohydrin, which has an -OH group and a CN group attached to adjacent carbons.

Wait, hydrogenation of cyanohydrin. Hmm. Let me think: the cyanide group (CN) is a nitrile. When nitriles are hydrogenated, they typically become amines. But wait, in this case, the hydrogenation is over Pd, which is usually for adding hydrogen across double bonds or maybe for removing functional groups. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is being converted into an amine, but under H2 and Pd, perhaps it's being hydrogenated to a primary amine. But I'm not too sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the cyanide group is being hydrogenolyzed. HCN addition gives a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol adjacent to a nitrile. Upon hydrogenation, perhaps the nitrile group is converted to an amine. But I'm not entirely certain about the exact product.

Alternatively, maybe the double bond is being hydrogenated. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin doesn't have a double bond. So perhaps the nitrile is being hydrogenated. Let me think: Nitriles (R-C≡N) when hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like Pd (maybe under different conditions), can be converted to amines (R-CH2-NH2) or to alkanes (R-CH2-CH3), depending on the conditions. Wait, but hydrogenation of nitriles usually gives amines. Or perhaps, using more vigorous conditions, they can be fully hydrogenated to the corresponding alkane.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about this part. Let me think again. The reaction is B → C using H2 and Pd. B is a cyanohydrin, which has an -OH group and a CN group. So, the CN is a nitrile. So, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to a CH2NH2 group, but wait, that's a primary amine. But I'm not sure if that's what happens here. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to a CH2CH3 (alkane) group. But how?

Wait, another possibility is that the nitrile is being reduced to an amine, but that would require perhaps a different catalyst, like Raney Ni. Alternatively, maybe it's a partial hydrogenation. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is being converted into a secondary alcohol or something else. Wait, I'm getting
