Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions yet. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are also some hints provided, so I need to use those to figure out what each compound might be.

First, let me outline the reaction sequence:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:

a) A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to give 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR of A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has 1715.

Alright, starting with what I know. The IR peak at 1750 for A suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester. But since all the reactions are about adding HCN and then reducing, it's more likely a ketone. So A is a cyclic ketone perhaps.

The reaction A → B with HCN. I remember that ketones react with HCN to form cyanohydrins. So B would be a cyanohydrin of A. So A is a ketone, B is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That sounds like a hydrogenation reaction. But wait, what's in B? It has an OH and CN group. I'm not sure about the specifics, but maybe the CN group is converted into something else. Oh, wait, H2 with Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds or maybe for reducing nitriles? Wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogen is adding to the double bonds if any.

Wait, B is a cyanohydrin, so it's a secondary alcohol with a cyanide substituent attached. When you reduce that, perhaps the nitrile group (-CN) is reduced. Nitrile to amine? Or maybe to an alcohol? Wait, I think when you hydrogenate a nitrile, you typically get a primary amine, but under certain conditions, maybe a ketone? No, wait: H2 and Pd would probably reduce the nitrile group. Let me think: Hydrogenation of nitriles can yield amines. For example, R-CN + H2 (Pd/BaSO4) → R-CH2-NH2? Or maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation that gives a primary amine.

Wait, but here, B is a cyanohydrin, which is R2C(OH)CN. So when B is hydrogenated, the CN group might reduce to CH2NH2? Or perhaps the OH group is getting involved. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is being hydrogenated if there's any. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should think about each step in more detail.

Another approach: let's think about the structure of A. The reaction of A with a phosphorous ylide gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So the ylide has a certain structure, and when it reacts with A, which is a carbonyl compound, it forms an alkene.

So in the product, 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, the substituents are methyl at positions 1 and 2, and a propenylidene group at position 4. Wait, "propan-2-ylidene" is like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)-, but wait, the structure is written as propan-2-ylidene. Wait, the ylide is typically of the form R2P=CH-R. So when the Wittig reacts with a ketone, it replaces the O with an R group from the ylide.

In the product, the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. So the substituents are two methyl groups (positions 1 and 2) and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4. Wait, but the product is a cyclopentane with a substituent that is a propenyl group attached via a double bond? Or is it a cyclopentane with a substit
