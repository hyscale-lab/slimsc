Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h symmetry is a type of molecular symmetry. Let me think about what that entails.

C3h symmetry, if I recall correctly, is a point group. The 'C3' part would mean a three-fold rotational axis, and the 'h' stands for horizontal mirror planes. Wait, no, actually, the point group notation can be a bit tricky. C3h would include a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's the combination of rotation and reflection.

Wait, no, point groups: C3h is a subgroup of the dihedral groups. So, it includes a three-fold rotation axis and several mirror planes. Let me think about the structure of each given molecule to see which has that symmetry.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

Wait, I think I can cross some off. Triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3B, right? Its structure is a central boron atom with three isopropyl groups attached. Is the molecule symmetric? Well, each isopropyl group is a substituent, but if the groups are all the same and arranged symmetrically around the central atom, then maybe it has a high symmetry. I think triisopropyl borate has Td symmetry because each substituent is in a tetrahedral arrangement. So it's probably not C3h.

Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule. Its structure is a bridge between two rings. Quinuclidine has a seven-membered ring with two bridgehead carbons. I think it's a tricyclic structure. Wait, no, quinuclidine is more like a bicyclic structure where there's a bridge between two carbons. I'm trying to visualize its structure. Quinuclidine has a three-membered bridge, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Maybe it has a C3 axis because the bridge might allow for three-fold rotation. But does it have a mirror plane as well? Hmm, not sure.

The other options are more complex with multiple rings and substituents. Let's look at the names. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Wait, the naming is a bit confusing. The prefix benzo means a benzene ring fused to the main structure. The numbers in the brackets indicate the positions where the rings are fused.

Wait, the main structure is trifuran, which is a tricyclic system involving three furan rings, I think. No, trifuran would be a tricyclic compound with three oxygen-containing rings, perhaps like a corannulene or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a polycyclic structure with three rings.

Hmm, maybe I should draw it out mentally. The compound is named benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-... So the main part is trifuran, and the benzene is fused at specific positions.

Wait, the general naming is such that the substituent (like benzo) is attached to the main ring system. The numbers and letters in the brackets indicate where the substituent is attached. So each benzene ring is attached at certain positions.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fused ring system. Let's think about the first option, option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Wait, the 'trifuran' part suggests three furan rings. Furan is a five-membered ring with one oxygen. So a trifuran would have three such rings fused together in some fashion.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about which of these structures has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis, and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis (a horizontal mirror plane). So when you rotate 120 degrees around the axis, the molecule looks the same, and the mirror plane would reflect it onto itself.

Looking at option D, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclic compound with a bridge. The molecule is known for having a three-membered bridge, which might indicate some three-fold symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane?

Wait, quinuclidine has a chair-like structure. When I look at its structure, it's a bridged bicyclic molecule, and I think it has a three-fold axis going through the bridge. So, when you rotate it 120 degrees, the substituents around the bridge would cycle, but quinuclidine doesn't have any substituents besides the bridge itself. So perhaps it has a C3 axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, maybe it has a C3i symmetry or something else. Hmm.

Looking at option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... This name suggests that three phenyl groups are attached to the trifuran system. So maybe the structure is a trifuran with three benzene rings fused at certain positions.

If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal fashion, then the molecule could have C3h symmetry.

Wait, the 'triphenyleno' indicates three phenyl groups attached. So the molecule would have three benzene rings attached at different points of the main structure. If they're arranged symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal planar arrangement around the central part, then the molecule could have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the main structure itself is symmetric, leading to high symmetry.

Wait, another approach: the question is which has C3h symmetry. Let's think about common structures with C3h. For example, some molecules with three substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point might have C3h.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three isopropyl groups attached to a central boron. Each isopropyl is a -CH(CH3)2 group. Since all three are identical and arranged symmetrically, the molecule should have a high degree of symmetry. Wait, I thought earlier it's Td symmetry. But Td is tetrahedral, which isn't the same as C3h.

Wait, Td symmetry is a point group with a four-fold axis (like methane). If all three substituents are arranged symmetrically around the central atom, which would require a trigonal planar arrangement. But wait, in a trigonal planar, the point group would be D3h or C3v, depending on the symmetry elements.

Alternatively, if the molecule is trigonal pyramidal, it would have C3v symmetry. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me think: for triisopropyl borate, the structure is a central B with three i-Pr groups. Boron typically has a trigonal planar geometry when bonded to three substituents. So the molecule should have a trigonal planar geometry, which is D3h symmetry. So that's a dihedral group with a three-fold rotation and three mirror planes (each through an atom and a midpoint of the opposite bond). But D3h is different from C3h. So maybe triisopropyl borate doesn't have C3h symmetry.

So perhaps the correct molecule is option D, quinuclidine.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge between two carbons, making it a [2.2.1] bicyclic system. The bridge consists of three carbons. The molecule has three bridges, each of which might contribute to symmetry.

Alternatively, I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. If you imagine rotating the molecule 120 degrees around the axis going through the bridge, it should look the same. And if there's a horizontal mirror plane, that would be along that axis. Or perhaps the mirror plane is perpendicular.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the structure. Quinuclidine has a bridge connecting two cyclohexane-like rings. No, wait, quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic molecule. It has a bridge that connects two carbons, each part of a six-membered ring. The bridge itself is three carbons long. So the structure is similar to bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane but with additional substituents.

Wait, but quinuclidine is actually a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. No, maybe not. Let me think: the structure has two bridgeheads, each connected by two bridges. Or perhaps it's a tricyclic system.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the symmetry elements. Quinuclidine is known to have a three-fold rotation axis. So if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. Also, perhaps it has a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis, which would make the symmetry C3h.

If that's the case, then quinuclidine (option D) has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, looking at the other options. Option A is a complex structure with three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran system. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal pattern, then it could have C3h symmetry.

Wait, the 'trifuran' part would be a three-ring system. Let's say each benzene is attached at a position that's 120 degrees apart from each other. Then, the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, making it C3h.

So which of these structures has that arrangement?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think about the substituents. The name is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... So three benzene rings are attached at specific positions on the trifuran. If each benzene is attached in a way that they are equally spaced around the central axis, then the overall symmetry would be C3h.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry?

I think quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis. Let me recall: quinuclidine has a bridge that connects two carbons, making a seven-membered ring. The structure has a three-fold axis; for example, if you look down the axis perpendicular to the plane, perhaps you can see a trigonal arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps option A is the correct one, as it's a molecule with three identical substituents arranged symmetrically.

Alternatively, let's think about the other options.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The substituents here are benzene rings attached to the trifuran. But how are they attached? If each benzene is at each of three positions, maybe 120 degrees apart, then the molecule could have C3h.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for three-fold symmetry. Let me think of the numbering. The benzo groups are attached at positions 1,2-c; 3,4-c'; and 5,6-c''. So each benzene is attached at different positions, but maybe arranged around the central axis in a trigonal fashion.

But without a clear picture, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine. Because I remember that quinuclidine has a three-fold symmetry, but I'm not entirely sure about the mirror plane.

Wait, another thought: C3h symmetry requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So if the molecule looks the same after a 120-degree rotation and has a mirror plane that is horizontal (i.e., bisecting the molecule into mirror images), then it has C3h.

Quinuclidine: Imagine looking at it from the top. It has a bridge, so the top and bottom are symmetric. If there's a three-fold rotation, and a mirror plane through the bridge, then yes. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule with three phenyl groups (option A) has that symmetry.

Wait, option A: triphenyleno... So each benzene is attached to the main trifuran. If the three benzene rings are arranged at 120-degree intervals around a central axis, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, leading to C3h symmetry.

So which of these is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because it's the only one that has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point.

Wait, but quinuclidine doesn't have identical substituents, it's more about the structure itself.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I can think of the point groups.

C3h is a dihedral group with a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must have a trigonal arrangement with a mirror plane.

Looking for a structure with three identical substituents arranged symmetrically.

Triphenyleno... would have three benzene rings arranged symmetrically around the main structure, perhaps on a central axis.

Wait, another approach: in the case of a molecule with three benzene rings attached to a central structure, if each is at 120 degrees, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis. If there's a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis, then it's C3h.

Alternatively, if the mirror plane is in the plane of the molecule, then perhaps it's D3h.

I think triphenyleno... would have three substituents arranged symmetrically, leading to C3h symmetry.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, another thought: the hexaone part in the name might imply that there are ketone groups in specific positions that could influence the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine. Because I think that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, making it C3h.

But I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about each molecule.

Option C: triisopropyl borate – Td symmetry, as the substituents are in a tetrahedral arrangement.

Option D: quinuclidine – has a three-fold rotation axis, and maybe a horizontal mirror plane. So perhaps C3h.

So I'm now more leaning towards option D being correct.

Wait, another thought: the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. That mirror plane would be perpendicular to the axis.

For quinuclidine, if the axis is along the bridge, then a horizontal mirror plane would bisect the molecule. Does that fit?

Alternatively, if the mirror plane is in the plane of the molecule, passing through the bridge, then it would be a vertical mirror plane, which would belong to a different point group, perhaps C3v.

Hmm.

Alternatively, I think that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and several vertical mirror planes, making it C3v symmetry, not C3h.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

C3h symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (i.e., the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis, and the mirror plane is in a plane that's not the same as any principal planes of the molecule. Alternatively, the mirror plane is perpendicular.

In any case, I think that triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A) has three substituents arranged symmetrically, leading to C3h symmetry.

So I'm going to go with option A as the correct answer.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry consists of a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and at least one horizontal mirror plane (σʜ), which is perpendicular to the rotation axis.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Triisopropyl Borate (Option C):**  
   This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom suggests **D₃h** symmetry, not **C₃h**, because it has additional vertical mirror planes in the trigonal plane. Thus, it does not fit the **C₃h** symmetry.

2. **Quinuclidine (Option D):**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a [2.2.1] structure. It has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) due to its symmetric arrangement of bridges. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σʜ), as the mirror planes in quinuclidine are vertical. Therefore, it has **C₃v** symmetry, not **C₃h**.

3. **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Option B):**  
   This molecule is a fused polycyclic system with benzene rings attached at specific positions. While it has some symmetry, the arrangement of substituents does not allow for a three-fold rotational axis combined with a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

4. **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (Option A):**  
   This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three phenyl groups attached symmetrically. The phenyl groups are arranged at 120° intervals around the central axis, giving the molecule a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σʜ) perpendicular to the rotation axis. This combination of symmetry elements makes it consistent with **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry is **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**.

**Answer: A**
