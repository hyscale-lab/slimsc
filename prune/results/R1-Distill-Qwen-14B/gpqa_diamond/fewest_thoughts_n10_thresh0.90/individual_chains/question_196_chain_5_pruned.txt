Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The given parameters are mass m, maximum amplitude A, and it's obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. Oh right, and the speed of light is c. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different formulas.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is v_max = sqrt(kA/m). But this is a relativistic case, so I guess that formula won't hold because relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

So, in the relativistic case, the equations of motion are different. The harmonic oscillator's potential is (1/2)kx², but relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the energy is given by the relativistic energy formula, which is gamma times mc². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right?

Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², similar to the classical case. The kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc² because relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². So the total energy E should be (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

At maximum amplitude A, the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². So when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, which gives the maximum speed. But wait, in the classical case, that's when all the potential energy converts to kinetic, leading to the maximum speed. But relativistically, it's more complicated because the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

So let me set up the energy equation. At maximum displacement (x=A), velocity is zero. So the total energy is all potential: E = (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic: E = (γ - 1)mc².

Wait, but wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at x=A is (1/2)kA². So setting the two expressions for energy equal:

(1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v is the maximum speed. So substituting, we have:

(1/2)kA² = ( (1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)) - 1 ) mc².

Hmm, that's the equation I need to solve for v_max.

Let me denote v = v_max, and solve for v. Let's rearrange the equation.

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc²

gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's denote u = v²/c², so that gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - u).

But let's try to proceed step by step.

So, (gamma - 1) = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - u), so:

1/sqrt(1 - u) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

1/(1 - u) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

So 1 - u = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Which gives u = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))² ]

Wait, that looks a bit complicated. Let me compute that.

u = 1 - [1/( ... ) ].

Alternatively, let me invert both sides:

1 - u = [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^(-2) ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me take the reciprocal both sides.

After squaring, I have 1/(1 - u) = [1 + a]^2, where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So 1 - u = 1 / [1 + a]^2

Then, u = 1 - [1 / (1 + a)^2 ]

So u = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2a + a² - 1 ) = 2a + a²

So u = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2

But since a is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is probably small unless the oscillator is moving at relativistic speeds. So perhaps a² is negligible compared to 2a. Let's check: (k A^2)/(2 m c²) could be a small term if m is large or c is large, but in relativistic situations, maybe not. Hmm, not sure about that.

But let's proceed without approximations. So:

u = [2a + a²] / (1 + a)^2

But u is v^2/c^2. So:

v^2/c^2 = [2a + a²] / (1 + 2a + a^2)

Take square roots:

v/c = sqrt( [2a + a²] ) / (1 + a )

Wait, but maybe it's easier to write in terms of v.

Wait, another approach. Let me write the expression for u again.

u = [2a + a²]/(1 + a)^2

So, v = c * sqrt( [2a + a²] ) / (1 + a )

But perhaps I can factor the numerator:

2a + a² = a(2 + a)

Hmm, but I'm not sure that helps.

Wait, another idea. Let me write the denominator as (1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a^2.

Wait, but perhaps I can factor this differently. Alternatively, let's express the numerator as follows.

Wait, let me compute the ratio [2a + a^2]/(1 + a)^2.

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: a(a + 2)

Denominator: (1 + a)^2

Hmm, perhaps factor out 1 + a.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the entire expression for v as:

v = c * sqrt( [2a + a²] ) / (1 + a )

So, sqrt(2a + a²) = sqrt(a (a + 2)) ) = sqrt(a) * sqrt(a + 2)

Wait, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

v = c * sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (1 + a )

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the expression:

sqrt( (2a + a^2) ) = sqrt( a(a + 2) )

But the denominator is (1 + a). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator as a^2 + 2a = a(a + 2), but I don't see an obvious simplification.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me go back to the equation.

We have (gamma - 1) = (k A^2)/(2 m c²)

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

gamma = 1 + a, where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Then, gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - u)).

So, sqrt(1 - u) = 1/(1 + a )

Squaring both sides: 1 - u = 1/(1 + a)^2

So u = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2

Which is u = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2a + a^2 - 1) = 2a + a²

So u = (2a + a²)/(1 + a)^2

Which is what I had earlier.

So, v = c * sqrt( (2a + a^2) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm. Let's see if I can factor this further. Let me factor a from numerator inside the sqrt.

sqrt(a (2 + a )) = sqrt(a) * sqrt(2 + a )

So,

v = c * sqrt(a) * sqrt(2 + a ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, but I'm not sure that helps.

Wait, let me plug in a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, a = (k A^2) / (2 m c² )

So, let me express it in terms of a.

But perhaps it's easier to compare with the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C is v_max = sqrt(k A²/m ), which is the classical formula. So if the relativistic effect is significant, option C is not correct.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, that's similar to what I had.

Wait, wait. Let me see.

Wait, from earlier, u = v²/c² = [2a + a^2]/(1 + a)^2.

So, v/c = sqrt( [2a +a²] )/(1 + a )

Alternatively, v/c = sqrt( (a)(a+2) )/(1 + a )

But perhaps there's another way to write this. Let me square both sides.

(v/c)^2 = [2a + a²]/(1 + a)^2

Which can be written as:

v^2 = c^2 * [2a + a²]/(1 + a)^2

Hmm.

But looking at option D:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the sqrt for option D.

Inside the sqrt is 1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ], because a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,
