Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, the nucleus in question is X, which is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium typically has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, that's a total of 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, I guess.

The question is about the energy required to accelerate this nucleus to 0.96 times the speed of light. Since it's a heavy ion, relativistic effects will definitely come into play. So I'll need to use the relativistic energy formulas.

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me compute the gamma factor. So v is 0.96c, so v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784), which is 0.28, I think. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, right. So gamma is 1/(0.28) = approximately 3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is Li-6, so I need the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. I think the atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol. Wait, no, wait: the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus in atomic mass units (u) is approximately 6.013 u. Because the atomic weight is about 7 (since Li has an atomic number of 3 and atomic weight ~7), but Li-6 is a specific isotope.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass. But assuming I can get the mass of the Li-6 nucleus, I can compute the rest mass energy. Remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy E_rest is m*c², which is (mass in u) * 931.5 MeV.

So, if the mass is 6.013 u, then E_rest is 6.013 * 931.5 MeV. Let me calculate that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.013 * 931.5 is about 12.1095. Adding them together gives approximately 5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011 GeV.

Wait, wait, let me get that calculation right. 6.013 * 931.5:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.013 * 931.5 = 0.013 * 900 is 11.7, 0.013 *31.5 is 4.095. So total 15.795 MeV.

So 5589 + 15.795 = 5604.
