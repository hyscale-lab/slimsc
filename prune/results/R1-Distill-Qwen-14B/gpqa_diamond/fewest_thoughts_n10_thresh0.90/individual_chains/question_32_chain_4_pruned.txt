Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. And I need to find the energy of the RHIC that gives this speed. The options are given, so maybe I can calculate it and see which one matches.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the total energy isn't just kinetic; it's the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes people refer to the kinetic energy as the energy in the context of accelerators. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy given would likely be the kinetic energy, right? Or is it the total energy (rest + kinetic)?

Actually, in particle physics, the energy of a particle in an accelerator is usually the kinetic energy. Or wait, no, sometimes it's the total energy. I think for high-energy particles, it's the total energy because the kinetic energy becomes significant compared to the rest mass. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should proceed and see.

So, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium. The standard isotope is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons and 3 protons. So the nucleus is Li-7. So I need to find the mass of Li-7.

Wait, the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass number. But actually, the exact mass might be needed. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the molar mass. Let's think. The atomic mass of lithium-7 is approximately 7 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So the mass m of the nucleus is 7 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 7 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 1.16235e-26 kg. But wait, I should be precise here. Let me calculate 7 * 1.6605e-27: 1.6605 * 7 is 11.6235, so 1.16235e-26 kg. Yes.

Now, the speed is 0.96c. So beta (β) is 0.96. Gamma (γ) is 1/sqrt(1 - β²). Let me compute beta squared: 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. Then gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857... Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, 0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, which is mc². So E = gamma * m * c².

Wait, but is this the total energy or the kinetic energy? Because sometimes when people talk about the energy of a particle in a collider, they refer to the kinetic energy. So I need to clarify.

In particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm. Let me recall. For example, the LHC accelerates protons to 6.5 TeV, which is their kinetic energy. So for heavy ions, I think the same applies. So if RHIC's energy is the kinetic energy, then I need to compute the kinetic energy K, which is (gamma - 1) * m c².

But wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." I think that in this context, the energy refers to the kinetic energy because when you talk about the energy of the collider, it's typically the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. So I should compute K = (gamma - 1) m c².

But let me make sure. Another approach: the total energy E = gamma m c². The kinetic energy K = E - m c² = (gamma -1) m c².

So if the problem is asking for the total energy, I'd use gamma. If it's asking for kinetic, (gamma-1). I need to determine which is correct. The problem says "the energy of the RHIC", which likely refers to the kinetic energy because colliders are designed to provide kinetic energy to the particles. So I'll proceed with K.

So K = (gamma - 1) * m c².

Now, plugging in the numbers:

gamma is approximately 3.5714, so gamma -1 is 2.5714.

m is 7 u, which is 7 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 1.16235e-26 kg.

c is the speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So let me compute m c² first.

m c² = (1.16235e-26 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 1.16235e-26 * 9e16 = 1.046115e-9 J.

Wait, 3e8 squared is 9e16. Multiply by 1.16235e-26 kg: 9e16 * 1.16235e-26 = 9 * 1.16235 = 10.46115, then 10.46115e-10 → 1.046115e-9 J.

Wait, wait, let me re-express that.

Wait, 3e8 squared is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

Multiply by m: 1.16235e-26 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = (1.16235 *9 )e-26 +16 → 10.46115e-10 → 1.046115e-9 J. So that's the rest energy, m c².

Now, K = (gamma-1) * m c² = 2.5714 * 1.046115e-9 J.

Let me compute this.

First, 2.5714 * 1.046115e-9.

Calculating 2.5714 * 1.046115:

Approximately, 2.5714 * 1 is about 2.5714. 2.5714 * 0.046115 is about:

Let's compute 2.5714 * 0.04 = 0.102856.

2.5714 * 0.006115 ≈ 0.015745.

So sum is 0.102856 + 0.015745 ≈ 0.1186.

So total is 2.5714 + 0.1186 ≈ 2.69.

Wait, no, that approach is wrong. Wait, 2.5714 * 1.046115 is the same as 2.5714 * (1 + 0.046115) = 2.5714 + (2.5714 * 0.046115). Let's compute each part.

2.5714 * 1 = 2.5714.

2.5714 * 0.04 = 0.102856.

2.5714 * 0.006115 ≈ Let me compute 2.5714 * 0.006 = 0.0154284, and 2.5714 * 0.000115 ≈ 0.0002956. So sum is approximately 0.0154284 + 0.0002956 = ~0.015724.

So adding to previous 0.102856: 0.102856 + 0.015724 ≈ 0.11858.

So 2.5714 * 0.046115 ≈ 0.11858.

So total 2.5714 + 0.11858 = 2.69 (approximately 2.69).

Wait, that's the factor in terms of the 1.046e-9 J.

So K ≈ 2.69e-9 J.

But wait, 2.69e-9 J is 2.69 nanojoules. But the options are in GeV. So I need to convert from joules to GeV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules.

So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, which is 1.602e-10 joules.

So to convert K from joules to GeV:

K (GeV) = K (J) / (1.602e-10 J/GeV).

So K = 2.69e-9 J / 1.602e-10 J/GeV.

Dividing 2.69e-9 by 1.602e-10:

That's (2.69 / 1.602) * (1e-9 / 1e-10) ) = approximately (1.68) * 10 ≈ 16.8 GeV.

Wait, that's around 16.8 GeV. But looking at the options, the closest option is A) 18.475 GeV, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me go back and recheck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the exact value for gamma, not an approximation.

Earlier, I approximated gamma as 3.5714, but let me compute it more accurately.

Beta is 0.96. So beta squared is 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - beta squared = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so 1/sqrt(0.0784) is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857. So that's correct.

But perhaps I should use more precise values for m and c.

Another thing to consider: maybe the rest energy is not exactly 7 u * c², but perhaps the actual mass is better calculated.

Wait, the mass number of Li-7 is 7, so the atomic mass is approximately 7 u. But the exact value might be a bit less because the binding energy makes the nucleus lighter. However, I'm not sure if the question expects me to use the exact molar mass or just the mass number. Since the problem says "Li with 3 neutrons" which is Li-7, let's proceed with 7 u.

So m = 7 u = 7 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Let me compute that more accurately.

7 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 1.16237734662e-26 kg.

Now, m c² = 1.16237734662e-26 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

3e8 squared is 9e16 m²/s².

So m c² = 1.16237734662e-26 * 9e16.

Multiply 1.16237734662e-26 * 9e16 = 1.16237734662 * 9 * 10^(-26 +16) = 10.4613961196e-10 J.

Which is 1.04613961196e-9 J.

Now, K = (gamma - 1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1 is 2.57142857.

K = 2.57142857 * 1.04613961196e-9 J.

Calculating 2.57142857 * 1.04613961196.

Let me compute this with more precision.

2.57142857 * 1.04613961196.

Let me break it down:

1.04613961196 = 1 + 0.04 + 0.00613961196.

So,

2.57142857 * 1 = 2.57142857.

2.57142857 * 0.04 = 0.1028571428.

2.57142857 * 0.00613961196 ≈ Let's compute this.

2.57142857 * 0.006 = 0.0154285714.

2.57142857 * 0.00013961196 ≈ approximately 0.000358.

So total for 0.00613961196 is 0.0154285714 + 0.000358 ≈ 0.0157865714.

Now, adding all three parts:

2.57142857 + 0.1028571428 = 2.6742857128.

Adding 0.0157865714 gives approximately 2.6900722842.

So K is approximately 2.6900722842e-9 J.

Now, converting to GeV:

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1.602176634e-10 J.

So K (GeV) = (2.6900722842e-9 J) / (1.602176634e
