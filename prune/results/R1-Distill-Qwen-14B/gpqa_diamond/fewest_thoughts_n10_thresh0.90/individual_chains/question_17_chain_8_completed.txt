Okay, so I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The given K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) tells us how stable the complex is. 

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, Ca-EDTA is a complex ion, so I think it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions in solution. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, right? But wait, the complex is formed from those two ions.

So the formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Since the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−, let's assume that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, the problem says "stochiometric", so maybe it's a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but in solution, the complex might dissociate a little. But with such a high K value (5e10), the dissociation should be minimal. So I can probably approximate that the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M, and the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are much lower.

So basically, K = [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So, rearranging, [Ca²+] = [complex]/(K * [EDTA^4−]). Wait, but wait, I need to find [Ca²+], but I don't know [EDTA^4−]. Hmm, maybe I can make an assumption here.

Wait, when EDTA is in solution, the free EDTA^4− concentration is usually low because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and can form complexes with various metal ions. But in this case, since the solution is just the Ca-EDTA complex, I think the only EDTA species is the complex itself and perhaps some free EDTA, but maybe the free EDTA is negligible.

Wait, but wait, let's think about this. The solution contains only the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, when it dissociates, it produces some Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. Let me denote the dissociation as:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced. Then, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x, and [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 - x. But since K is so large (5e10), x will be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, K = (0.02)/(x^2) =5e10.

Wait, that makes sense. Because K is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so x is small. So, solving for x:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x = sqrt( 0.02 / 5e10 )

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4 * 1e-12 =4e-13. Then the square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5 Wait, wait, let me compute that.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is smaller. Let me compute 4e-13 as 4 x 10^-13. The square root is 2 x 10^(-6.5). Wait, 10^-6.5 is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = approx 6.32e-7 M. 

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. 

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. I had K = 5e10, [complex] is 0.02 M. So K = 0.02/(x^2) → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 =4e-14? Wait wait, wait, wait, let me recalculate that.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so K=5e10 = (2e-2)/(x²). So x² = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2)/(5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x^2 is 4e-13 → x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7 M. So that's correct.

So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex is represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) produced from the dissociation. The concentration of the complex remains approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) since the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K \). Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \):

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
