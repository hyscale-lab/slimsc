Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I need to find the concentration of calcium ions when there's a Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stoichiometric means that the ratio is 1:1, right? So one calcium ion combines with one EDTA^4- ion to form the complex. The given K for the complex is 5x10^10, which I think is the formation constant, Kf.

Wait, Kf is the formation constant, which tells us how much the complex forms. The formula for Kf is [CaY]^2+ / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-]), where Y is EDTA. So the complex is CaY²+.

But in this problem, we're given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY²+] is 0.02 M. And we need to find [Ca²+].

Wait a minute, but EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms a complex with Ca²+. So the solution has CaY²+ in it, and we want to find the free Ca²+ concentration.

The formation constant Kf is very large, which means the complex is very stable. So most of the Ca²+ and EDTA will be tied up in the complex. But wait, the problem says it's a 0.02 M solution of the complex. So if the complex dissociates, how much Ca²+ will be in solution?

Hmm, I think the equation would be CaY²+ ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-. So Kf is [Ca²+][Y^4-]/[CaY²+]. We know Kf is 5e10, [CaY²+] is 0.02 M. But wait, if the complex is stable, then [Ca²+] and [Y^4-] would be very low. But wait, wait, does the dissociation of the complex produce both Ca²+ and Y^4- in equal concentrations? Because the stoichiometry is 1:1.

So let's think about the dissociation. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then the concentration of Y^4- would also be x, because each mole of CaY²+ produces one mole of each. So [Ca²+] = x, [Y^4-] = x, and [CaY²+] = 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation would be minimal, so x would be very small compared to 0.02. So I can approximate [CaY²+] ≈ 0.02 M.

So plugging into Kf: Kf = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02.

We know Kf is 5e10, so 5e10 = x² / 0.02. Then x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4? Wait, that can't be right because x would be larger than the initial concentration. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, 0.02 M is the concentration of the complex, and x is the free Ca²+.

Wait, I think I made a mistake with the Kf expression. Let me get this right. The formation constant Kf is calculated as [CaY²+]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

Yes, that's correct. So Kf = [CaY²+]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

Since [Ca²+] = [Y^4-] = x, and [CaY²+] is approximately 0.02 M (since x is tiny compared to 0.02), then Kf = 0.02/(x²) =5e10.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is Kf = [complex]/([metal][ligand]).

So in this case, Kf = [CaY²+]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

So rearranging, [Ca²+][Y^4-] = [CaY²+] / Kf = 0.02 / 5e10.

But [Ca²+] = [Y^4-] = x, so x² = 0.02/(5e10).

So x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. Then square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5, which is about 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. Square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the Kf expression. Another way: the dissociation of the complex would be CaY²+ ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. The dissociation constant Kd is 1/Kf.

So Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4-]/[CaY²+] = 1/(5e10).

Since Kd is so small, the dissociation is minimal, so [Ca²+] = [Y^4-] = x, and [CaY²+] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kd = x² / 0.02 = 1/(5e10).

So x² = (0.02) * (1/(5e10)) ) = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-2 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5=6.32e-7.

Yes, same result. So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁺), we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex is represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2+} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is defined as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2+}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Since the stoichiometry of the dissociation is 1:1, the concentrations of free calcium ions (\([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\)) and free EDTA ions (\([\text{Y}^{4-}]\)) are equal, denoted as \( x \). The concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2+}]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \)).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2+}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
