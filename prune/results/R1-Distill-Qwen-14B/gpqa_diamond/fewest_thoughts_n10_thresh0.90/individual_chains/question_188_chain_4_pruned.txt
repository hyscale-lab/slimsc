Okay, so I've got this question about crystal structures, specifically a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral? I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I remember that rhombohedral systems have all sides equal and all angles equal. Oh right, so it's a special case where the unit cell is a rhombohedron, meaning a three-dimensional figure with six faces, each of which is a rhombus.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, in crystals, the unit cell's edge length is the interatomic distance only in certain cases, maybe simple cubic? Or maybe here, since it's a rhombohedral structure, the edge length 'a' is 10 Angstroms. I think that's the case here because interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice, which in a cubic structure would be the edge length. So I'll proceed with a = 10 Angstroms.

The problem is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Oh, right, the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the Miller indices h, k, l. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α) - (2hl cos β) - (2kl cos γ) ) ), wait wait, no, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Alternatively, the formula I'm familiar with for cubic systems is d = a/(sqrt(h² +k² + l²)). But wait, this is a rhombohedral system, which is a type of hexagonal system or is it a cubic system? No, no, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems, distinct from cubic. So the general formula for any crystal system is needed here.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing is d = [ (a² (b² c² sin² α sin² β sin² γ ))^(1/2) ] / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ]^(1/2) )}... No, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, another approach is to use the formula that involves the unit cell parameters. For a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos α)/(a²) - (2hl cos β)/(a²) - (2kl cos γ)/(a²)

Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, all a, b, c are equal, right? Because in the rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, so a = b = c. So perhaps this simplifies the formula.

So let me set a = b = c = 10 Angstroms. The angles are all α = β = γ = 30 degrees. The Miller indices here are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging into the formula:

1/d² = (1² + 1² + 1²)/(a²) - 2*(1*1 cos α)/a² - 2*(1*1 cos β)/a² - 2*(1*1 cos γ)/a².

Wait, but wait, the formula I have for interplanar distance is:

d = ( (a² (1 - cos² α - cos² β - cos² γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ )) / (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ) )^(1/2)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Wait, because in rhombohedral, all angles are equal to alpha, so β and gamma are also 30 degrees. So substituting, but wait, does that hold true?

Wait, no. In a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal (a = b = c), and all three angles are equal (α = β = γ). So, the general formula for interplanar distance can be simplified.

Let me try to rederive it. The general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d^2 = [ (a² (b² c² ) ) / (h² +
