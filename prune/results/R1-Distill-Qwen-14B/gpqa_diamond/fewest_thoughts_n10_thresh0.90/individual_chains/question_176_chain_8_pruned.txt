Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors, right? So I should probably check if this is a unit vector. Let's calculate its norm.

The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is probably (-1, 2, 1) divided by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector. Because in quantum mechanics, states are represented by unit vectors in a Hilbert space.

So the state vector |ψ> is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

The operators P and Q are given as matrices. First, let's write down operator P.

Operator P's matrix is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And operator Q's matrix is diagonal:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators, so their eigenvalues are real. I remember that, so checking if these matrices are Hermitian.

For P: Let's see if it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real, the transpose should be the same. Let me check the matrix:

Row 1: [0, a, 0], where a is 1/sqrt(2)
Row 2: [a, 0, a]
Row 3: [0, a, 0]

The transpose of this matrix is the same as the original because the non-diagonal terms are symmetric. So yes, P is Hermitian.

For Q, it's diagonal with real elements, so it's definitely Hermitian. So that's good.

The question asks about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no—actually, the measurements are in sequence: first P, then Q. So the measurement of P is done, and then the state is projected into the eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured value. Then, Q is measured on that projected state.

Wait, no wait, the question says: "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the process is measure P first, then measure Q.

Wait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Oh, the exact wording is: "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the order is P first, then Q.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and
