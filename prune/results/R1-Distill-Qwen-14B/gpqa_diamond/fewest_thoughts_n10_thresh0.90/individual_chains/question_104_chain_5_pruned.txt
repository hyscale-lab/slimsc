Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through slowly.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet, both similar in mass to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key here is the shift in the spectral lines observed — Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves back and forth due to the planet's gravity, and we measure that shift in wavelength. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, right?

Wait, but wait. The formula I think is involved here is the one that relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period. K is the maximum velocity of the star in the RV method. The formula I vaguely recall is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)* (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part goes away. But wait, actually, the formula for K is more accurately given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But wait, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So that simplifies it a bit. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, alternatively, I think another approach is to relate the semi-amplitude K to the orbital period and the mass ratio. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (Neptune), perhaps the ratio of their velocities can help find the ratio of their periods.

Wait, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )^(1/3). But since the eccentricity is zero, and M_p is the same for both planets (both are Neptune-like), and M_star is same for both stars, but P is different for each planet. So how do K and P relate?

Wait, no, the formula I think is K = (v) where v is the velocity of the star. The formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3)
