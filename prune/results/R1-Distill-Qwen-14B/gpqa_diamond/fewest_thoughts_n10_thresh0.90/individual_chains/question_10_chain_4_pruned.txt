Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a-d has the highest density. The options are A to D, each corresponding to one of a-d. So I need to compare each planet's density.

Wait, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. The formula is density = mass/volume. So I should calculate the density for each planet.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So its mass is the same as Earth's, and radius same as Earth's. So density would be same as Earth's. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So a) has density 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the question already states its density, so that's straightforward. So b) is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Oh, same composition means same density, right? Because composition affects mass and volume. If it's made of same materials as Earth, then density is same as Earth. So if Earth has density 5.5, c) also has 5.5. But wait, because it's more massive, does that affect the density? No, because density is mass/volume. If it's 5 times more massive, but if the radius is larger, the volume increases, but same density. So yes, same density as Earth. So c) is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. So same density as Earth, which is 5.5. So d) is 5.5.

Wait, wait. Am I missing something? Because I thought varying the mass and radius would change the density. Oh, but in the cases where the composition is the same, the density remains the same. Because composition determines the density. So if a planet has the same composition as Earth, regardless of how big or small it is, its density is the same as Earth's.

So all options a, c, d have same density as Earth, which is 5.5. So looking at the options, option b is also 5.5. So all have the same density?

Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, option a says Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So yes, same as Earth.

Option b: 2 Earth masses but density is given as 5.5. So that's same as Earth.

Wait, wait a second. If a planet has a higher mass and same density as Earth, then its volume would be larger because volume scales with mass divided by density. So mass is 2, density same. Volume is 2/(5.5) times Earth's volume. Hmm, but the volume is (4/3)πr³, so radius would be larger than Earth's.

But regardless, the density is 5.5 for b).

But what about option c: same composition (so same density as Earth) and 5 times Earth's mass. So density is 5.5.

Same for d: same composition, 0.5 Earth mass, density is 5.5.

So all these a, b, c, d have the same density? But that can't be.

Wait, let me check the question again. Oh wait, option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5. So that's given, so that's correct. But maybe I'm missing the point.

Wait, maybe the question isn't about same composition, but just the given parameters. Let me look again.

Option a: Earth mass and radius → same as Earth → density 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density 5.5 → same as Earth's density.

Option c: same composition as Earth → same density as Earth → 5.5.

Option d: same composition → same density as Earth →5
