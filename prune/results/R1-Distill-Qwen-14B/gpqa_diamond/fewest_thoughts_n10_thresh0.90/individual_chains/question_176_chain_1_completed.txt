Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see.

The problem is about finding the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring observables P and Q on a quantum system. The system's state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1) at time t. Wait, no, wait, wait—wait, that's the state vector. Oh, right, state vectors are usually column vectors, and they should be normalized. Wait, does this state vector need to be normalized? Because if the sum of the squares of the absolute values is 1, it's normalized. Let's check: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so it's not normalized. So I'll have to normalize it first, perhaps? Or maybe the problem already accounts for that.

Wait, but the question is about the probabilities after measuring P and then Q. So, I think the process is: measure P first, then measure Q on the resulting state.

Wait, but the question says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q". Hmm. So, measuring P, getting 0, and then measuring Q on the resulting state and getting -1. Or wait, perhaps it's the joint probability of both happening. So, the overall probability would be the product of probabilities if they're independent, but maybe not. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the measurements are sequential, so the second measurement depends on the outcome of the first.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. The initial state is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. Let me represent it as a column vector. Since the vector isn't normalized, I'll have to normalize it. Because the probabilities depend on it.

So first, compute the norm: ||ψ|| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. So |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

Next, the operator P is given as a matrix. Let me write that down. P has rows: first row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].

Hmm, what's the structure of P? Let me think. It's a 3x3 matrix. Maybe it's a projection operator? Or perhaps it's an observable (Hermitian matrix). Let me check if P is Hermitian. The elements of P should equal their conjugate transposes. Let's see: in P, the (2,1) element is 1/sqrt(2), and (1,2) is 1/sqrt(2), so they are equal. Similarly, (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2), same. The diagonal elements are 0 and 0 and 0? Wait, no, wait: the second row's diagonal element is 0, yeah. So P is symmetric, thus Hermitian. So it's a valid observable.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of P would be the possible outcomes of the measurement. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P to find the possible results of measuring P. Similarly for Q.

Wait, the question is about getting outcome 0 for P. So I need to find the eigenvector(s) of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, because that's the state the system will collapse into after measuring P=0. Then, measure Q on that state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities using the projection approach.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Normalize the initial state |ψ>.

2. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to each eigenvalue. But since we're interested in P=0, we can find the eigenspace for P=0 and compute the projection of |ψ> onto that eigenspace.

3. The probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the norm of this projection.

4. Then, the state after measuring P=0 is the normalized projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P=0.

5. Then, we measure Q on this new state. The probability of getting Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector component.

Wait, but perhaps to find the joint probability, we can compute the probability of P=0 and then, given that, the probability of Q=-1. Multiply the two probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe the probability is the inner product of the initial state with the eigenvectors of P=0, then the inner product of that with the eigenvectors of Q=-1, but I'm not sure. Let's think step by step.

So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Wait, P's matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm. Let me write P as:

[ 0          1/√2       0      ]

[1/√2       0          1/√2   ]

[ 0          1/√2       0      ]

So, to find the eigenvalues, we solve det(P - λ I) = 0.

But this could be complicated. Alternatively, let's guess the eigenvalues. The trace of P is 0. Because the diagonal elements are zero. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of P is perhaps... Hmm, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues by other means.

Alternatively, perhaps P has a symmetry. Let me think about the structure. It's a symmetric matrix, and perhaps the eigenvectors are along certain directions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvectors by noting that this matrix might be related to spin operators or other symmetric systems.

Wait, perhaps it's a permutation matrix multiplied by 1/sqrt(2). Let me see:

The matrix P has elements 1/sqrt(2) in (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), and 0 elsewhere.

Wait, that's not a permutation matrix, but it's a symmetric matrix connecting certain states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that P can be written as (1/sqrt(2)) times a matrix that has 1's in the (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), and (3,2) positions, and 0 elsewhere.

Wait, but perhaps I can represent P as a graph, where each node is connected to some others.

But perhaps another approach: let's consider that the matrix P is the sum of two matrices. For instance, maybe it's a combination of Pauli matrices or something similar. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues by considering that P is a 3x3 matrix with a specific structure. Let's consider that the matrix might have three eigenvalues, including 0.

Wait, let's compute the trace, determinant, etc.

The trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

The determinant of P is the product of eigenvalues. Let's compute the determinant.

Hmm, the determinant calculation for a 3x3 matrix can be tedious, but perhaps there's a shortcut.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvalues by considering the eigenvectors. Let me try.

Suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). Let's plug into the equation (P - λ I) v = 0.

So, (0 - λ) a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0 * c = 0.

(1/sqrt(2)) a + (0 - λ) b + (1/sqrt(2)) c = 0.

0 * a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + (0 - λ) c = 0.

So, the three equations are:

1. -λ a + (1/√2) b = 0.

2. (1/√2) a - λ b + (1/√2) c = 0.

3. (1/√2) b - λ c = 0.

Let me try to find non-trivial solutions for a, b, c.

From equation 1: λ a = (1/√2) b → b = (λ√2) a.

From equation 3: (1/√2) b = λ c.

But from equation 1, b = λ√2 a, so substitute into equation 3:

(1/√2)(λ√2 a) = λ c → (λ) a = λ c → c = a (assuming λ ≠ 0).

Wait, if λ is zero, then equation 1 and 3 would give b=0 and c=0, leading to a free variable a. So for λ=0, the eigenvectors would have a = any value, b = 0, c = a. So the eigenvectors would be (a, 0, a), which can be written as a*(1, 0, 1). So, one eigenvector is (1,0,1). But wait, let me check.

Wait, if λ=0, then equation 1: 0*a + (1/√2) b = 0 → b=0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) a + 0*b + (1/√2) c = 0.

Equation 3: (1/√2) b + 0*c =0 → b=0.

So equation 2 becomes (1/√2)(a + c) = 0 → a + c =0 → c = -a.

Wait, so for λ=0, the eigenvectors would be (a, 0, -a). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Wait, but earlier I thought it was (1,0,1). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

Equation 1 for λ=0:

(0 - 0) a + (1/√2) b = 0 → (1/√2) b = 0 → b=0.

Equation 3: (1/√2) b - 0 * c = 0 → since b=0, equation holds.

Equation 2: (1/√2) a - 0 * b + (1/√2) c = 0 → (1/√2)(a + c) = 0 → a = -c.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a). So for example, if a=1, then the vector is (1, 0, -1), which can be normalized to (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So, for P, one eigenvalue is λ=0, with eigenvector (1, 0, -1) up to scaling.

Now, are there other eigenvalues? Let's assume that P has eigenvalues λ = 1 and λ = -1, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the other eigenvalues can be found by assuming a solution where a = c and b = something.

Wait, perhaps another eigenvector could be symmetric. Let's suppose that a = c and b = something else.

Wait, let me try to see if there's an eigenvector where a = c. Let me set a = c, then see what b would be.

From equation 1: -λ a + (1/√2) b = 0 → b = λ√2 a.

From equation 3: (1/√2) b - λ c = 0 → (1/√2) b = λ a → since a=c.

Substituting b = λ√2 a into equation 3: (1/√2)*(λ√2 a) )= λ a → (λ a) = lambda a → which holds for any a and λ. So that doesn't give us new information.

Equation 2: (1/√2) a - λ b + (1/√2) c = 0.

Since a = c, equation 2 becomes (1/√2)(a + c) - λ b = (1/√2)(2a) - λ b = (sqrt(2) a) - λ b =0.

But from equation 1, b = (lambda sqrt(2) ) a. So substituting into equation 2:

sqrt(2) a - lambda * (lambda sqrt(2) a ) = 0.

=> sqrt(2) a - (lambda^2 sqrt(2) ) a =0.

Divide both sides by sqrt(2) a (assuming a ≠0):

1 - lambda^2 =0 → lambda^2=1 → lambda=1 or lambda=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

So for lambda=1:

We have b = (1)*sqrt(2) *a.

And c =a.

So the eigenvector can be written as (a, sqrt(2) a, a) → a(1, sqrt(2), 1).

Similarly, for lambda=-1:

b = (-1)*sqrt(2)*a.

c =a.

Eigenvector is (a, -sqrt(2) a, a) → a(1, -sqrt(2), 1).

So now, the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

The eigenvectors for P=0 are (1,0,-1) as we found earlier, up to normalization.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

We need to find the probability that measuring P yields 0. That is, the probability that the system collapses into the eigenvector corresponding to P=0.

So first, the eigenvector for P=0 is (1,0,-1) up to normalization. The normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1], since 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 =2.

So, the projection of |ψ> onto this eigenvector is:

< v | ψ >,

where v is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

So compute the inner product:

(1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1] * (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

So the inner product is (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) [ (1)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)(1) ].

= (1/sqrt(12)) [ -1 + 0 -1 ] = (1/sqrt(12)) (-2) = -2/sqrt(12) = -2/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, so | -1/sqrt(3) |^2 = (1/3).

Wait, so the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

But wait, let me confirm that calculation.

Wait, the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) * [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ].

So (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )) * (-1 -1 )= (1/sqrt(12)) * (-2) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1^2)/(3) )=1/3. So correct, 1/3.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the system collapses into the state v, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Then, we need to measure Q and find the probability of getting -1.

What's the operator Q? The matrix for Q is:

Row 1: [1, 0, 0]

Row 2: [0, 0, 0]

Row 3: [0, 0, -1]

So Q is a diagonal matrix with elements 1, 0, -1.

Q is already diagonal, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:

For Q=1: (1,0,0).

For Q=0: (0,1,0).

For Q=-1: (0,0,1).

So, when we measure Q on the state (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2), let's compute the probability of each outcome.

The state after P=0 is |v> = (1, 0, -1) / sqrt(2).

So, to find the probability of measuring Q=-1, we take the component of |v> in the direction of the eigenvector for Q=-1, which is (0,0,1).

The inner product is < (0,0,1) | v > = (0,0,1) * (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2) = (-1)/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/2).

So the probability of getting Q=-1, given that P was measured to be 0, is 1/2.

So, the joint probability of first getting P=0 and then Q=-1 is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but I should confirm: is the second measurement done on the state after the first measurement, which is |v>, so the probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

But looking at the options, option D is 1/6. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. The initial state is [-1, 2, 1]/sqrt(6).

2. The projection onto P=0 is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). The inner product gives the amplitude as (-2)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/sqrt(3), so the probability is 1/3.

3. The state after P=0 is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

4. Measuring Q on this state: the component in the (0,0,1) direction is (-1)/sqrt(2), so the probability is 1/2.

5. Multiply the two probabilities: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the answer should be D) 1/6.


The problem involves finding the joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) for a quantum system with an initial state \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The operators \( P \) and \( Q \) are given as matrices, and the solution proceeds as follows:

### Step 1: Normalize the initial state
The initial state \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) is not normalized. Its norm is:
\[
\| |\psi\rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The matrix \( P \) is:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( P = 0 \) is:
\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |v_0\rangle \). The inner product is:
\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(P = 0) = \left| \langle v_0 | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the system collapses into the state:
\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The matrix \( Q \) is:
\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors:
\[
|q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the projection of \( |v_0\rangle \) onto \( |q_{-1}\rangle \). The inner product is:
\[
\langle q_{-1} | v_0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \left| \langle q_{-1} | v_0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Compute the joint probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:
\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
