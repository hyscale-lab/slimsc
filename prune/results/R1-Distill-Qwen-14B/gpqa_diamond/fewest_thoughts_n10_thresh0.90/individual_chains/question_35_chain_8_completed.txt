Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me see. I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are represented by matrices, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important for understanding the possible states.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, let me write that out:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Then, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), the matrix Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But wait, the question is asking which statement is correct. Let's go through each option.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, and the real parts are ±h/(4π). Wait, eigenvalues of angular momentum components are usually multiples of ħ/2. Since ħ is h/(2π), perhaps I should check what the eigenvalues of S are first.

Wait, S matrix. Let me compute its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ of a 2x2 matrix [[a,b],[c,d]] are found by solving det(S - λ I) = 0.

So for S:

det( [ [-λ, -i], [i, -λ] ]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) ) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

Wait, -i times i is -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - 1 = 0.

So λ² = 1, so λ = ±1. So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are c * λ. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay should be (h/(4π)) * 1 = h/(4π) and (h/(4π))*(-1) = -h/(4π).

Wait, but what about the eigenvalues in the options. Looking at option B, it's about the imaginary and real parts. Hmm, but eigenvalues I found are real. So if the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real numbers. So their imaginary parts are zero. So any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect.

Option A suggests the imaginary parts are ±2πh. That doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. But our eigenvalues are h/(4π) times 1 and -1. So unless h/(4π) is 1, which it isn't, this option is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A² but not of Az. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum don't commute, so eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az or Ax. But what about A squared? A² is the square of the total angular momentum. Since Ay and A² commute (because A² is the Casimir operator, which commutes with all components), their eigenfunctions can be shared. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it could also be an eigenfunction of A². So option C says that the eigenfunction can be an eigenfunction of A² but not Az. That sounds correct. So C might be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Hmm, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but the matrix operator's basis is determined by the choice of basis. I'm not exactly sure about this one. For a 2x2 matrix, there are two eigenfunctions, which are orthogonal. They form a basis. So D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." That sounds plausible since the matrix operates in a two-dimensional space, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D could be correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but let me think again.

Wait, the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so in a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) will form a basis for this space, so statement D is correct. But statement C is also correct because eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A². So then why are both C and D correct? But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the operator Ay has eigenvalues ±h/(4π). So for the eigenfunctions, do they also eigenfunctions of A²? Let me compute A². Since A is the angular momentum operator, A² is the sum of squares: A² = (Ay)^2 + (Az)^2 + (Ax)^2. But since I'm working in a two-dimensional space, perhaps for spin-1/2 particles, A² would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)(ħ/2 + 1). Wait, but wait. The intrinsic angular momentum for a muon (which is a lepton, spin 1/2) would have S² eigenvalues (s(s+1))ħ², where s=1/2. So S² = (3/4)ħ².

Wait, but in the problem, Ay is the operator c*S, where c = h/(4π). So Ay = c S, so S = (4π/h) Ay. Then, S² would be (16 π²/h²) Ay². So the eigenvalues of S² would be (3/4)ħ², so the eigenvalues of Ay² would be ( (3/4) ħ² ) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) * (1/c²? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For a spin-1/2 particle, any component of the angular momentum has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, but in our case, Ay has eigenvalues ±h/(4π). Wait, if ħ is h/(2π), then h/(4π) is ħ/2. Because h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) * (1/2) = ħ/2. Oh! So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2. Which is consistent with spin-1/2.

So, in this case, the eigenfunctions of Ay are the eigenfunctions of S_y, which are the eigenstates of S_y. Since S² commutes with S_y, the eigenfunctions of S_y are also eigenfunctions of S². So the statement in option C is correct. So the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is the same as S². So C is correct.

So, looking back at the options, which statements are correct.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Correct because, for spin-1/2, Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. But A² commutes with Ay, so eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A².

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors span the space, that makes sense. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, let me check the wording.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So, I think that is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the two-dimensional space. So D is correct.

Hmm, but the question is about which is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But wait, the options are given as four, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about option D. The matrix operator Ay has eigenvectors, which form a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Let's look at each option's validity.

Option A: The eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Same reasoning as A, eigenvalues are real. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Correct, because Ay and A² commute, so eigenvectors of Ay are eigenvectors of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

But wait, the question is to find which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options may have only one correct.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, both C and D seem correct. But perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay form a basis for the space, so D is correct. But then, the question is about which statement is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem again. Let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, the matrix Ay is c * S, where S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and c = h/(4π).

The eigenvalues of S are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay are c * (1) = h/(4π), and c*(-1) = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

The eigenvectors can be found by solving (Ay - a I) φ = 0, where a is each eigenvalue.

For a = h/(4π):

(Ay - a I) = (h/(4π) * S) - a I = since a = h/(4π), this becomes (h/(4π) * S) - (h/(4π)) I.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so multiplying by c gives:

Ay = [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

Thus, (Ay - a I) is:

[ [ -a, -i c ], [ i c, -a ] ]

Substituting a = c:

[ [ -c, -i c ], [i c, -c ] ]

Which is:

c * [ [ -1, -i ], [i, -1 ] ]

The determinant is zero, so the system is:

- a φ1 - i c φ2 = 0 → -c φ1 -i (h/(4π)) φ2 = 0.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to set up the equations. Let me write the equations for the eigenvector.

The first equation: -a φ1 - i c φ2 = 0 → φ1 = (-i c / a ) φ2.

But since a = c, this is φ1 = (-i c / c ) φ2 → φ1 = -i φ2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1; i], perhaps. Because if φ2 =1, then φ1 = -i.

Wait, let me check. If I choose φ2 =1, then φ1 = -i *1 = -i. So the vector is [ -i, 1 ]^T. But to make it a unit vector, we can divide by sqrt( | -i |^2 + |1|^2 ) = sqrt(1 +1 )= sqrt(2). So the eigenvector is ( -i, 1 ) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, for a = -c, the eigenvectors would be proportional to ( i, 1 ), perhaps. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the eigenvectors right. So the eigenvectors are orthogonal, which makes sense.

So, the eigenfunctions are the vectors ( -i, 1 )/√2 and ( i, 1 )/√2. These form a basis for the 2D space, so option D is correct.

So, among the options, statements C and D are correct. But the options are exclusive.

Wait, the problem is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me look again at the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Since the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, D is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the correct answer is only one. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because [Ay, Az] = iħ something, so they don't commute, so eigenvectors can't be shared. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. But the basis is defined by the choice of eigenvectors, so yes, they form a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but the problem only allows one correct option. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the correct answer is D or C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about which one is correct.

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² and Ay commute, yes. So C is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the question is about the calculation during the process; perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, I need to read the options again.

Wait, the question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, I would realize that the eigenfunctions form a basis, which is option D.

So, considering all that, I think option C and D are correct, but perhaps the correct answer is C.

But wait, the problem gives four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, the initial problem is to choose the correct statement. So let me think again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Yes, because A² and Ay commute, their eigenvectors can be shared. But the Z-component Az doesn't commute with Ay, so the eigenvectors are different.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

So, both C and D are correct statements. But since the options are exclusive, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, looking back at what the options are, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait another thought: for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenfunctions of Ay are spin-up and spin-down in the Y-direction. These are not eigenfunctions of Az because they are in different directions. So, C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

So, I think option C is correct.

Wait, but option D is also a correct statement. So I'm confused. But perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you might note that the eigenvectors form a basis (option D), which is true. So D is correct.

Alternatively, considering the problem, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is about which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation.

So, during the process, you'd find that the eigenvalues are real, which eliminates options A and B. Then, you would note that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D), and that they can be eigenfunctions of A² (C), but not of Az. So both C and D are correct.

But the options are presented as four, each to be considered. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the matrix Ay is 2x2, and its eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. So D is correct. So in the calculation, you would see that. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The matrix Ay has eigenvalues h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Its eigenvectors are orthogonal, and they form a basis for the 2D vector space. So D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors. So D is correct.

So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that C is correct, but perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, no, perhaps I should re-examine the options. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct because the eigenfunctions form the basis, which is a fundamental aspect when solving the problem.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me make a decision based on the reasoning.

I think the correct answer is C. Because in the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az but are eigenfunctions of A².

Wait, but the calculation to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors would involve finding that the eigenvalues are real, so A and B are wrong. Then, when considering the properties, C and D are options.

Wait, perhaps I should just go with option C as the correct answer because the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

But I'm still not entirely confident, but as per the reasoning, I'll go with option C.


The problem involves analyzing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are found by solving \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers. This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**, as both suggest imaginary parts in the eigenvalues, which is incorrect.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the \( 2 \)-dimensional space. This makes **Option D** correct, as the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are indeed the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).

3. **Relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   - The square of the angular momentum operator \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes **Option C** correct.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - Both **Option C** and **Option D** are correct based on the analysis. However, since the question asks for the statement that is correct during the calculation, **Option D** is more relevant to the process of finding the eigenfunctions and their role as a basis for the matrix operator.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
