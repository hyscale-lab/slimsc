Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit complicated. I remember that the metric typically tells us about the geometry of the space. So, maybe I should try to understand what kind of space this metric describes.

I think for metrics in two dimensions, the form often relates to surfaces embedded in higher dimensions. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a non-orientable surface, which is kind of like a sphere but with a negative curvature. But wait, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, right? So their geometry is hyperbolic.

Wait, but in this case, the metric is written in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space. Or perhaps it's a 2D Lorentzian manifold, but the question is about area, which is a positive quantity, so maybe it's a Riemannian metric.

Let me think about the metric. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². That looks like the equation of a circle, because x² + y² = r². So, 4 is the square of 2, so the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). That suggests that the domain of x and y is such that x² + y² < 4. So the points (x,y) lie inside a circle of radius 2. Otherwise, the denominator would be zero or negative, which might not make sense in the metric.

Now, the metric has a factor (32)/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So the line element is scaled by this factor. I think the area of a surface in 2D can be found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the region. Or wait, actually, the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor.

So the metric tensor g here is a diagonal matrix, with components g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant of g is (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² = x² + y². So sqrt(det g) would be 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, but wait. The determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32/(4 - r²)) ) = (32)^2/(4 - r²)^2. The square root is 32/(4 - r²). So the area element dA is (32)/(4 - r²) dr dθ, perhaps? Wait, no, because in polar coordinates, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So putting it together, dA = (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ.

So to find the total area, I need to integrate this over all allowed r and θ. The allowed r is from 0 to 2, because 4 - r² must be positive (since r^2 = x^2 + y^2, and 4 - r² > 0 implies r < 2). So the limits for r are 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A would be the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, the integral over θ is straightforward; it's 2π. So A = 2π * ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, so let's compute that integral. Let me set u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So - (du)/2 = r dr. Hmm, let me rewrite the integral.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2. Let me factor out the 32: 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Substituting u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

Changing variables:

When r = 0, u = 4. When r = 2, u = 0.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [1/u] * (-du/2).

The negative sign swaps the limits, so it becomes 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

Which is 16 ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/u) du.

But wait, the integral of 1/u is ln|u| + C. So evaluating from 0 to 4 would be [ln 4 - ln 0]. But ln 0 is negative infinity. So this integral diverges to infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the integral becomes 16 (ln4 - (-infinity)) ), that's infinity. So the area is infinite?

Wait, but that's strange. How can a pseudosphere have infinite area? Hmm, I thought pseudospheres were finite surfaces with finite area but infinite perimeter or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, original integral: ∫
