Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I've got a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what the structure is, and then determine what happens when it's reacted with the given reagents.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's break this down. High chemical shifts usually indicate certain functional groups. The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet. That's quite high, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So that's one possibility for that peak.

Then, looking at the aromatic region. The 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) suggest some para-substituted aromatic rings. Because in para substitution, you get doublets with coupling between the two protons. Wait, no, actually, wait. If you have a para-disubstituted benzene, each set of protons would be a doublet because each H is adjacent to only one other H on the ring, but wait, in para substitution, the protons are actually more deshielded, but in a substituted benzene where each substituent is in para, the protons would be as two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene, maybe with two substituents, each taking one set of Hs.

Wait, but let me think again. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two different aromatic rings. Because each is a doublet of 2H. So maybe two phenyl groups attached to some structure. Or perhaps each is a pair of equivalent protons in a para-substituted ring.

Alternatively, perhaps each is part of a benzene ring with substituents. Let me think, for example, if the compound has two para-substituted benzene rings attached to a central chain. 

Then, the 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) might be vinyl protons or perhaps some adjacent substituents. The broad singlet could indicate some exchange, maybe protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a phenolic OH group, but wait, the 6.27 is a double bond perhaps. Or maybe it's a proton next to an electron-withdrawing group.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. For example, OCH2CH2... or something similar. The doublet suggests each of the two Hs is coupled to one other, so maybe they're part of a CH2 group between two identical groups.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has two phenyl groups connected to a chain that includes an aldehyde group, an oxygen-containing group, and a methylene (CH2) group.

Looking at the molecular formula, C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, X=0 (no halogens), N=1, O=1.

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5.

Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, a benzene ring (3 DoU), a double bond (1), and a ring or double bond (another 1), making total 5. Or another wayâ€”maybe two benzene rings? But wait, two benzene rings would be 3*2=6 DoU, which is more than 5. Hmm, perhaps it's a benzene ring plus a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe the structure is a diphenyl compound. Let me think: two benzene rings connected through a chain. Let's say each benzene is para-substituted. So, perhaps each benzene is attached to a certain point in the chain.

Let me try to draw this: maybe the central chain has an aldehyde group, some oxygen-containing group, and two benzene rings attached.

Looking at the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 is probably the aldehyde H. So that's one part. Then the 3.6
