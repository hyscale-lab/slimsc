Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's see. The molecular formula might help figure out the structure later, but maybe the NMR data is more useful for that part.

The NMR data is provided. Let's look at each peak:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This seems like aromatic protons, possibly para-substituted because doublets are common in para substitution if there's symmetry. 

- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another aromatic set. Maybe ortho to something else?

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet could mean these are protons on an aromatic ring with some substituent that makes them exchange, like an -OH group. But wait, the H's are on the aromatic ring, or maybe they're on a conjugated system?

- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This seems like a CH2 group, maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like an oxygen, perhaps. Maybe a -CH2-O- structure, or maybe adjacent to a carbonyl.

So putting this together, the molecule probably has an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and perhaps a conjugated system with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO: X is 0, N is 1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be five rings and double bonds, but likely a combination. Let's think about the NMR again.

The aldehyde at 9.72 suggests that. Then, maybe a benzaldehyde-like structure, but the molecular formula is larger. Alternatively, perhaps a substituted benzaldehyde with another substituent.

Looking at the aromatic signals. 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) might be a para-substituted benzene. Because each is a doublet, and each has two protons, that would fit two protons each in a para arrangement. For example, perhaps a para-substituted benzene with another group attached.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) could be a conjugated dienyl system. Or maybe two protons on an aromatic ring that are next to an oxygen or something. Alternatively, maybe these are part of a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like a phenol group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6.27 ppm is a -CH2- group adjacent to something else. Wait, no, the integration is 2H, so maybe it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen or another group.

Wait, another thought: the 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) could be a CH2 attached to an oxygen, like a methylene group next to an oxygen. So maybe O-CH2-CH2- something? Or maybe it's part of a carbonyl group. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 attached to a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but if it's a doublet and each H is attached to a CH2, maybe it's part of a butenone or something similar. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with substituents. Let's try to sketch a possible structure.

Suppose the molecule has an aldehyde group (CHO), two aromatic rings (since the molecular formula has 8 carbons, and benzene rings contribute 6, so maybe two benzene rings? No, 8 carbons: benzene is 6, so perhaps a benzene ring and a substituent. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons: benzene (6) plus two more. So maybe a benzaldehyde with a substituent?

Wait, or perhaps it's a diphenyl compound. Wait, diphenyl something. Let's see: two benzene rings would be 12 carbons, which is more than 8. So maybe not diphenyl. Perhaps one benzene ring, and a substituent that's a three-carbon chain or something.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an oxygen, like a phenol group.

Wait, looking at the NMR again. The aldehyde is at 9.72. Then the aromatic signals: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That pattern is similar to para-substituted benzene rings. So maybe there are two para-substituted benzene rings or one.

But then the 6.27 (bs, 2H) could be two protons that are next to an OH group, maybe on a benzene ring. Because if the ring has an -OH group, the adjacent protons would be deshielded and perhaps show up as a broad singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps those 2H are part of a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like a substituted vinyl group.

Wait, another approach: the reactions given are a set of reagents. Let me look at them to see what they might do.

The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl

2. H2O

3. aq. KOH, Heat

So, first reagent is nitrous acid (HNO2), which is used in diazotization reactions. Typically, this is done with aromatic amines, especially aniline derivatives. Diazotization is when an aromatic amine is converted into a diazonium salt.

Second step is H2O. Hmm, maybe hydrolysis of a diazonium salt? Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like coupling, hydrolysis to phenols, etc.

Third step is aqueous KOH and heat. This might be a SN2 reaction, or perhaps a nucleophilic attack. Alternatively, in the case of a diazonium salt, heating with KOH could lead to a substitution reaction, like replacing the diazonium group with an OH group.

Now, putting this together: the starting compound likely has an aromatic amine group. Let me think about the NMR. The starting compound has an -NH2 group? But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If the starting material has a primary amine, perhaps the N is in an -NH2 group.

Wait, but in the NMR, I don't see a peak that would correspond to NH2 protons, which usually appear around 1-5 ppm, possibly broad. But the 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet of 2H. Could this be NH protons? Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, the -NH2 group might be exchanged and not appear in the NMR, but that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is part of a ring, like a pyrrole or something, but that may complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzylamine derivative. If it's an aromatic amine, after diazotization, it would form a diazonium salt, which can then be hydrolyzed.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aldehyde is present. So the starting compound has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the molecule is something like benzaldehyde with an amino group attached.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a secondary amine. For example, a benzylamine attached to another group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Let me think. If the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde, then the structure would be:

O=CH-C6H4-NH2

But then, in the NMR, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, which is the 9.72 peak. The aromatic protons would be split based on substitution. The 4-aminobenzaldehyde would have the aldehyde, and the amino group, which is para to the aldehyde.

In such a structure, the aromatic protons would be in a specific pattern. For 4-aminobenzaldehyde, the ring would have the aldehyde in position 1 (let's say), amine in position 4. The protons in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would also be equivalent, but I'm not sure about the splitting.

Wait, 4-aminobenzaldehyde would have two sets of aromatic protons. Let's see: the ring has substituents in 1 (CHO) and 4 (NH2). So the protons in 2 and 6 would be ortho to the NH2 and para to the CHO. Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 2-aminobenzaldehyde, but that might change the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not a benzaldehyde but has a different structure. Let me think about the NMR again.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) might be an NH group. But if it's a secondary amine, perhaps the NMR would show a different shift. Or maybe it's an -OH group. Wait, the molecular formula includes an O, so perhaps it's an alcohol group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation again to make sure. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens. So 2n +2 = 2*8+2=18. 18 -9 =9. Then subtract any X (like Cl) and add N. So 9 -0 +1 =10. 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation.

Which could be: one ring (benzene, 3 double bonds plus a ring), and a double bond elsewhere, but that's 4. Or perhaps a benzene ring (3 degrees) plus a double bond (1) plus a ring (1), but that's 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and a double bond in the substituent.

Alternatively, maybe it's a coumarin derivative or something similar. Coumarin has a benzene ring fused to a lactone, but I'm not sure if that fits the formula.

Wait, another approach: let's try to figure out the structure from the NMR.

- 9.72 (t, 1H): aldehyde proton.

- 6.98 (d, 2H): aromatic, perhaps as part of a para-substituted ring.

- 6.51 (d, 2H): another aromatic group, perhaps a separate substituent?

Wait, the 3.66 (d, 2H) is a CH2
