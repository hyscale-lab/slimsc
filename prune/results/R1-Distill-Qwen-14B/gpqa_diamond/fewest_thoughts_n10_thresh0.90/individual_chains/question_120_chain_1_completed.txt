Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I think I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So like, if I have a certain range of parallax values, how many stars would I expect in that range? I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think it has something to do with the area or volume in space.

Stars are uniformly distributed, so the number density is the same everywhere. Let me think. The number of stars in a region should depend on the volume of that region. But since we're dealing with parallax, which is 1/distance, I need to relate distance and parallax.

Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Now, if I consider a small change in parallax, say dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance? Let's see, d is inversely proportional to plx, so when plx increases, d decreases. The derivative of d with respect to plx is -1/(plx)^2. So for a small change in plx (dplx), the change in d (dd) would be approximately -dplx/(plx)^2. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, think about the number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. Since parallax is inversely related to distance, a shell at distance d has a thickness dd. The volume of such a shell would be 4πd² * dd, because it's a spherical shell. But wait, no, wait—actually, in terms of parallax, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So when plx changes by dplx, d changes by dd = -d^2 dplx. Maybe that's the right way to think about it.

So the volume element in terms of parallax would be something like dV = 4π (d)^2 * (dd), but substituting d = 1/plx and dd = -d^2 dplx. Wait, let me compute that. So d = 1/plx, so d^2 = (1/plx)^2. And dd is the change in d, which is (d dplx) * derivative of d with respect to plx. The derivative of d = 1/plx is -1/(plx)^2. So dd = (-1/(plx)^2) dplx.

Putting it all together, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/(plx^2)) dplx. Wait, that would be negative, but we can take the absolute value since we're considering the volume. So dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) ) dplx? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, let me recompute.

Wait, no, the shell at distance d has radius d, so the volume is 4πd² * thickness. Here, the thickness is dd. So dV = 4π d² dd. But d = 1/plx, so dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 (dd). But dd is in terms of dplx. So since plx = 1/d, then d d = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but that gives a negative, but when integrating, we can take positive since it's about the volume. So dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, no, I think I messed up a step. Let me try again. Let's say plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

The volume of a thin shell is 4π d² * thickness in d (dd). So dV = 4π d² dd.

But dd is the change in d when plx changes by dplx. So d d = (dd/d plx) * d plx.

Compute dd/d plx: since d = 1/plx, dd/d plx = -1/(plx^2).

So dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but we can ignore the sign for the volume.

So dV = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

But wait, the number of stars in this volume would be proportional to the volume, assuming uniform distribution. So the number of stars N in a range of d plx would be N = n * dV, where n is the number density of stars.

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so that's N per d plx. Since N = n * dV, and dV is proportional to 1/plx^4, then N is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. But I thought the answer might be 1/plx^2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the substitution. Let's think about it differently. The flux or the number of stars you observe in a certain range of parallax. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. But we can express this shell in terms of parallax.

Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is proportional to dV, so N ∝ 1/plx^4 * dplx. Therefore, the number per unit plx (d plx=1) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's option A. But I was thinking the answer might be option B, 1/plx². Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the solid angle. Wait, but since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume is proportional to the volume. And the volume as a function of plx is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but let me think of it another way. Suppose I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. The corresponding distances are d = 1/plx and d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). The volume between these two distances is 4π (d^2 (d + dd) - d^2 d ) = 4π (d^2 * dd). But dd is approximately -d^2 dplx.

So the volume is 4π d^2 * (-d^2 dplx) ), which is 4π (d^4) * dplx. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of flux. The number of stars per unit area per unit parallax. But perhaps that's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: the number density of stars is n (stars per volume). The volume per unit parallax. So for each plx range dplx, the volume is 4 pi (d)^2 (dd), where d = 1/plx, and dd is the change in d for a change in plx.

As before, dd = -d^2 dplx. So the volume is 4 pi (d^2) (dd) ) = 4 pi (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 dplx) ) = 4 pi (-1/plx^4) dplx. The negative sign just indicates direction, so the volume is 4 pi (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume is n * 4 pi (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit dplx is n *4 pi / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer should be option A. But wait, I think I remember that the number of stars per unit volume in terms of parallax is 1/plx^3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another way: think about the distribution in 3D space. Consider that the number of stars in a thin shell of radius d is proportional to the surface area times the thickness. Surface area is 4 pi d^2. Thickness in d is dd. So number is 4 pi d^2 dd * n.

Now, since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So substituting, number is 4 pi (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 dplx) ) *n.

Which is 4 pi n (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per dplx is 4 pi n / plx^4.

Wait, that's the same conclusion as before. So the number per unit plx (d plx) is 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, I'm confused because sometimes I thought it's 1/plx^2. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the flux. The number of stars you observe with a certain parallax depends on the area they cover. But in this case, the question states stars are uniformly distributed, so it's about the volume.

Wait, another way: Let's model the number of stars in a range of parallax. For a given parallax plx, the corresponding distance is d = 1/plx.

The volume between d and d + dd is 4 pi d^2 dd.

Now, express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So substituting, the volume is 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx^2 dplx ) = 4 pi (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is proportional to the volume, so N = k * (1/plx^4) * dplx, where k is a constant. So the number per unit dplx is k / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought the distribution might involve a cube. Like, if plx is a distance measure, then volume is a cubic term.

Wait, let me think about it another way. The number of stars in a given volume is n × volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, n is the same everywhere.

The volume for a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Because the shell's radius is 1/plx, and the thickness is dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume is 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But wait, earlier I thought maybe option D (1/plx^3) was correct. Let me see why.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units or the substitution. Let me think about the dimensions.

Parallax plx has units of parsecs (pc), so plx = 1/d, so d has units of parsecs as well.

The volume element is 4 pi d^2 dd. The units are (pc)^2 * pc = pc^3, which is correct for volume.

When I express in terms of plx, d = 1/plx, so d^2 is 1/(plx)^2. And dd is (1/plx^2) dplx (ignoring the negative sign). So d^2 dd = (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 1/plx^4 dplx.

So volume is 4 pi (1/plx^4) dplx. So number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I've seen some sources say that the number of stars per unit of parallax increases as 1/plx^3. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from considering the number per unit of parallax in terms of flux, which is 1/plx squared. But here, it's about the number in shells, which depends on volume.

Alternatively, maybe I'm double-counting some factors. Let me think about the 3D space.

Each star at distance d contributes 1/(4πd^2) to the surface density. So the number of stars per unit area at distance d is n * (1/(4 pi d^2))? No, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should model the number per unit volume in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. The volume element in terms of plx would require taking into account how the volume changes with plx.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax plx and thickness dplx is N = n × 4 pi (1/plx^2) × (1/plx^2 dplx). Wait, that gives N = n ×4 pi / plx^4 × dplx. So N is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I think I've heard that the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^2, but that was in the context of surface density. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing surface density and volume density. Let me clarify.

The total number of stars in a volume element is n * dV, where dV is the volume. So if I express dV in terms of plx, I get 4 pi (1/plx^2) (1/plx^2 dplx) = 4 pi (1/plx^4) dplx. So N = n × 4 pi (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is 4 pi n / plx^4.

So the answer should be option A: ~ 1/(plx^4).

But I'm a bit unsure because I thought the answer was 1/plx^2. Maybe I should think of this in terms of the density of stars per inverse parsec.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars at a distance d is proportional to the surface area of the sphere (4 pi d^2) multiplied by the number density (n) and the thickness (dd). But since n is uniform, the number is N = n * 4 pi d^2 dd.

But plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = -1/(plx^2) dplx.

So N = n *4 pi (1/plx^2) * (1/(plx^2) dplx) )= n *4 pi (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit dplx is 4 pi n / plx^4.

Thus, the number per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But wait, I'm still a bit confused because I remember that when you plot the number of stars against parallax, you often see a distribution that's roughly flat, implying 1/plx^2. But maybe that's in some other context.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering the wrong scaling. Let me think about the number of stars per unit volume in 3D space.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume is n. For a thin shell, the volume is 4 pi d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is N = n 4 pi d^2 dd.

But since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dd = - d/(plx^2) dplx. So substituting:

N = n 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * (d/(plx^2)) dplx).

Wait, d is 1/plx, so (d/(plx^2)) is (1/plx) / (plx^2) )= 1/(plx^3).

So N = n 4 pi (1/plx^2) (1/plx^3) dplx ) → n 4 pi (1/plx^5) dplx.

That can't be right, because it's giving 1/plx^5, which isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, no. Let me re-express the substitution correctly.

We have N = n 4 pi d^2 dd.

But d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So substituting:

N = n 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2) dplx.

The negative is just a direction, so we can ignore it.

So N = n 4 pi (1/plx^4) dplx.

So N per dplx is 4 pi n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is 1/plx^4, which is option A.

I think I've gone through this multiple times, and each time I end up with option A. So the correct answer must be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). 

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the thickness \( dd \) can be expressed in terms of \( d\text{plx} \) as \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the volume expression, the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( dV \), so \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx} \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per \( d\text{plx} = 1 \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

This result aligns with the fact that the volume of a shell at a given distance decreases rapidly with increasing distance (or decreasing parallax), leading to a steep decline in the number of stars per unit parallax range. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
