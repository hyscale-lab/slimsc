Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic reactions involve the shift of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds. The classic examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, so I'll try to think this through.

The question has three parts, each with a different reaction. Let me tackle them one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to give product A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a structure where the amine is attached to two methoxy groups. So it's (CH3O)2NCH2CH3? Or wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2-NH2? No, wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. 1,1-dimethoxy would mean both oxygens from the ethyl group are methoxy. So the structure is like CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3O)2CH-NH2? No, no, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, so 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 on both CH2 groups. So the structure is CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Or maybe it's H2N-C(OCH3)2. Hmm, that might make more sense. So the amine is on a carbon that's connected to two methoxy groups.

When this reacts with but-3-en-2-ol (which is CH2CH2-C-OH?), wait no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, butene has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol
