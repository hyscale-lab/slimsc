Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency for the product after a certain reaction. Hmm, let me start by breaking it down.

The compound in question is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, right? The numbering is 1, 2, 3, etc. So, the cyclohexene part is at position 3, which means there's a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, I guess. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group. Formyl is a CHO group. And at position 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is CH2=CH-, I think. So putting that together, the structure must have a cyclohexene ring with a substituent at each of positions 2 and 5.

Wait, let me sketch this out. The cyclohexane ring has a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Then, the substituents: at C2 is a formyl (CHO), and at C5 is a vinyl group (which would be CH2CH2 but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So it's CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. The vinyl group is -CH2-CH2? No, no, vinyl is a CH2-CH2 group but with a double bond. Oh wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the group is attached via the CH2. So the structure would have at C5 a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond? Wait no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so it's attached to the ring as CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2's? No, that can't be. Oh wait, no, the vinyl group is a substituent where the ring carbon is attached to a CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the CH2 and the next carbon. So the structure would have a double bond in the substituent.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let's imagine cyclohexene ring with positions 1 through 6. Position 3 is the double bond, so between C3 and C4. Then, at C2, a formyl group (CHO) is attached. And at C5, a vinyl group. Hmm, so the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, vinyl is -CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the group is CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two carbons. So, the substituent at C5 is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2s. Wait, perhaps I should clarify that.

But maybe that's not the main point. The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, wait, that's the reaction called the hydroboration-oxidation? No, wait, red phosphorus and HI. Oh! That's the reaction where a carbonyl group is converted into a CH2 group. Wait
