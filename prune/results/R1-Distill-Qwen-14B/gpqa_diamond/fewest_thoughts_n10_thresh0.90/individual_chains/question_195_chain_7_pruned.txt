Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about planets transiting and occulting around a star. Hmm, transiting means the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, right? And occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the star blocks it. Both events are important for detecting exoplanets, I think.

So the setup: There's a star with radius 1.5 times the Sun. A first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet has a radius 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period of the second planet so that it transits and occults.

Wait, transit and occultation events depend on the orbital configuration, right? Both planets should be aligned so that the second planet can sometimes pass in front of the star (transit) and sometimes be behind the star (occultation). But how does that affect their orbital periods?

Oh, wait, I remember that for two planets to have both events, their orbits must be in such a way that they can both pass in front and behind each other relative to the star. So maybe their orbits need to be in a certain ratio. Or perhaps it's about the Hill sphere or something else?

Wait, another angle: the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of the star. The impact parameter is given as 0.2 for the first planet. Impact parameter is the distance in units of star radius from the center of the star when the planet transits. So for the first planet, impact parameter b = 0.2. That means when it transits, the planet's path is 0.2 star radii away from the center.

But the second planet's transit would depend on the relative positions of their orbits. For both to transit, their orbital planes must be aligned. But the question says they share the same orbital plane, so that's already taken care of.

Wait, the problem says both planets are in the same system, same orbital plane. So their orbital planes are aligned, which is good for transiting events. Now, the question is about having both transit and occultation events. Occultation happens when the planet is behind the star, so the star must eclipse the planet. But for that, the planet must be the same orbital distance as the other planet, or else?

Wait no, if the planets are in the same orbital plane but different distances from the star, then one might transit while the other is in a different position. But for occultation, the second planet must pass behind the star. But for that to happen, the second planet's orbit must be such that the star can block it from our view during part of its orbit.

Wait, maybe the key here is that for a planet to both transit and be occulted, it must be that the planet is inside the star's disk when viewed from Earth. But wait, the planet's size matters. The occultation is when the planet moves behind the star, so the star blocks the planet's light. But for that to happen, the planet must be within the star's apparent disk. So the planet's orbital distance can't be too far, because if it's too far, it might not pass behind the star.

Wait, but wait. The transit depends on the planet passing in front. The occultation depends on it passing behind. So the orbital period must be such that the two planets are sometimes in the right positions for both events.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the relative orbital periods. For both events to occur, the planets must align such that their positions allow the second planet to eclipse and be eclipsed. So the orbital periods must be in a ratio that allows them to catch up.

Wait, maybe the maximum period occurs when the two planets' orbits are such that the inner planet's orbital period is synchronized in a way that the outer planet's period is such that it can still transit and be eclipsed. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and the second is 2.5 Earth radii.

The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. Let's find the semi-major axis of the first planet's orbit using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that (a^3)/(T^2) = (G(M_star + M_planet))/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, we can approximate it as (a^3)/T^2 = (G M_star)/(4 π²).

But perhaps it's easier to use the version in terms of the star's mass. Wait, the formula is often presented as a^3 / T^2 = (M_star + M_planet) / (M_sun) * (1 year)^2 / (1 AU)^3.

Wait, but that's for astronomical units and years. Alternatively, the formula can be written as (a in meters)^3 / (T in seconds)^2 = G(M_star in kg) / (4π²).

Alternatively, we can use the version:

a³ / T² = (M_star) [in solar masses] * (1 AU)³ / (1 year)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the semi-major axis of the first planet.

Given T = 3 days. Let's convert that to years. 3 days is 3/365 ≈ 0.008219 years.

M_star is 1.5 times the Sun's mass, so M = 1.5 M_sun.

So applying Kepler's third law:

a^3 / T^2 = (M_star) * (1 AU)^3 / (1 year)^2

So a^3 = (M_star) * (T^2) * (1 AU^3) / (1 year^2).

Wait, maybe I should plug in the numbers. Let me compute it:

T is 3 days. Let's convert T to years:

3 days * (1 year / 365.25 days) ≈ 0.008219 years.

So T ≈ 0.008219 years.

M_star is 1.5 M_sun.

So a^3 = (1.5) * (0.008219)^2 * (1 AU)^3.

Compute that:

(0.008219)^2 ≈ 0.00006755.

Multiply by 1.5: 0.000
