Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can figure out. I'm a bit rusty on some of these, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The unknown compound's formula is one of four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a very broad peak might suggest something like an alcohol (like an -OH group), maybe a ketone? No, wait, ketones have a different peak. Oh wait, if it's very broad, perhaps it's an -OH in an alcohol. Because carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch too, but sometimes they're even broader and maybe around 2500-3300. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but the options don't seem to have N, so probably not.

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated, or maybe an aromatic ring with some double bonds. Wait, wait, 1700 is around where a ketone or aldehyde would be. 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or something else.

Wait, another thought: 1700 could be an ester or a ketone, and 1650 might be a conjugated double bond. But if there's a peak at 1650, maybe it's an aromatic ring with C=C stretching, but that's more like around 1450-1600 cm^-1. Hmm. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a carbonyl group that's next to something else, like an ester or maybe an amide (but again, the options don't have N).

Wait, let me think again. If there's a strong peak at 1700, that's probably a carbonyl group. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Or maybe it's something else, like an aromatic ring's stretching. But I'm not so sure.

Moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the molecule has at least one double bond. That fits with the 1650 peak possibly being a C=C.

So putting that together: the IR shows a broad O-H (maybe an alcohol), a carbonyl (1700), and perhaps a C=C (1650). So possible functional groups could be an ester (which has a carbonyl and an O), an alcohol, and maybe a double bond.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a familiar mass. What could that correspond to? Let's think about common fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (which is 45), but wait, (CH3)2O is 15 (CH3) * 2 + 16 O = 46? Wait, wait, 12*(2) + 6*(1) + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. So that's 46. Hmm, another possibility: maybe a CH2O group? No, that's 30. Alternatively, maybe a CO group (28) plus something else? Or perhaps it's a fragment from a ketone. Wait, 45 could be C3H7O? Or maybe C2H5O2? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 could be the mass of a CH2=CH-O group, but that doesn't directly give 45. Alternatively, a fragment like CH2CH2O? Maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options. Let's see the possible molecular formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2: Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, that's not right. Wait, actually, the DoU formula is (2nC +2 - nH - nX + nN)/2. For C6H12O2: (12 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2=(2)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, which implies a double bond. So DoU would need to account for that.

Wait, let me recalculate DoU correctly. DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

For C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so that implies a double bond. So perhaps one double bond (1 DoU) and that's it. But wait, in O-containing compounds, the O could account for rings or double bonds.

Wait, no, O doesn't contribute to DoU unless it's part of a ring. So if the compound has a double bond and an oxygen-containing group, the total DoU would be more than 1. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me calculate each option's DoU.

Option A: C6H12O2.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. So either one ring or one double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so a double bond. So that accounts for one DoU.

Option B: C6H10O.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So perhaps a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree.

So, the molecule has a double bond (from the vinyl H's in NMR). That accounts for one DoU. So which options have at least one DoU?

All except perhaps D. Wait no, all options have at least one DoU. Hmm.

Wait, the IR shows a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1, which is likely a carbonyl group. So the compound must have a carbonyl, which would contribute a DoU.

So let's consider that the carbonyl is one DoU. Then, the double bond from the vinyl H's is another DoU.

So the total DoU would be at least two.

Looking at each option:

Option A: DoU=1. So if the compound has a carbonyl (DoU=1) and a double bond (DoU=1
