Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic data. Let me break down the information provided and see what I can figure out.

The compound is characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's look at each of these.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but the question mentions several peaks in the 1H NMR including vinyl hydrogens, so maybe it's an alcohol or something with an O-H group. Other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.), and 1650 might be something like conjugated carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or a conjugated carbonyl group. Hmm, like an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl groups are CH2=CH- or similar, so that suggests the compound has a double bond. So maybe an allylic structure or something with a vinyl group, like an ester with a double bond nearby, or perhaps a ketone with a double bond.

Now the mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for (CH3CO)+ which is the acetyl group. Alternatively, it could be the methyl group with something, but 45 is 45. Let's think: 45 could correspond to (CH3COO-), but wait, that's 45? Let's calculate: CH3COO- has a molecular weight of 12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2 = 24 +3 +32=59? No, that doesn't add up. Wait, another thought: maybe it's (CH2O) something. Alternatively, the fragment could be from a ketone or an ester.

Wait, 45 could be the mass of the acetate ion. Acetate is CH3COO^−, which has a molecular weight of 60 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2 = 24 +3 +32=59? Oh wait, 12*2 is 24, H3 is 3, O2 is 32: 24+3+32=59. Hmm, but the fragment is at 45. So maybe another possibility. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3 group with something else.

Wait, wait, another approach: common fragment ions. At m/z 45, one common ion is (CH3)2COH, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group? Alternatively, perhaps it's the fragment where a methyl group is lost. Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible molecular formulas.

The options are: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So let's consider each.

The molecular formula for each option is:

A) C6H12O2: degree of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let's compute: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, if I have two O's, maybe an ester group (which has a carbonyl and an ether linkage).

But wait, the IR has two carbonyl peaks: 1700 and 1650. Hmm, two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one is conjugated?

Wait, another thought: 1700 could be ester or ketone, and 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ring with a ketone. Or maybe an amide, but that's not likely here.

Wait, another angle: in the NMR, vinyl hydrogens are present, so the compound has at least one double bond. That adds another degree of unsaturation. So if the formula is C6H12O2, the degrees of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1, but if there's a double bond, that would add another, bringing it to 2. Alternatively, if the formula is C6H10O2, (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So that could account for a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or other structures.

Wait, let's compute degrees of unsaturation for each option:

For C6H12O2:

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2= 1.

So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR has vinyl H, so that suggests a double bond. So if the formula is C6H12O2, and it has a double bond (another DoU), that would give 2 DoU, but according to the formula, the DoU is 1. That can't be right. So perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, no, the formula's DoU is 1. So if the molecule has a double bond, that would require that the formula's DoU is 2. So maybe the formula is C6H10O2.

DoU for C6H10O2: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. So that could be a ring plus a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond (but that's less likely).

Alternatively, the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which I thought was O-H. If the compound has an O-H group, that could be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H peak would be very broad and around 2500-3300 cm^-1. Also, a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700, and perhaps another peak if there's conjugation.

Wait, but looking at the IR data: 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl. 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugation, or perhaps another carbonyl group. Alternatively, an aromatic ring's C=C stretch is around 1600-1500, so 1650 could be that. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: 1650 could be an ester group's carbonyl, but usually that's around 1740-1700. Hmm, maybe not. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ester or a ketone adjacent to a double bond.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the Mass Spec part. The fragment at m/z=45. I'm trying to recall what fragments correspond to that mass. Maybe it's a CH3CO+ fragment, which is 45 (CH3CO is 45: 12*2 +1*3 +16=24+3+16=43? Wait, that adds up to 43, not 45. Hmm. Wait, 45 could be a carbonyl group plus something. Or perhaps it's the CH2O group (30) plus something. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)2CO which is 58. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from an acetate group. The acetate group (CH3COO-) has a molecular weight of 59. But the fragment is 45. Hmm. Alternatively, what if it's a (CH2)2O group? No, that's 48 (12*2 +1*4 +16 = 24+4+16=44? Not 45. Wait, 3 carbons: maybe CH3CH2O+ would be 45? Let's compute: CH3CH2O+ is 12*2 +1*5 +16 = 24+5+16=45. Oh! So that's 45. So the fragment could be a ethoxy group (CH2CH2O+) losing something else.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fragment could be the loss of a water molecule. Wait, but that's 18. No, not that.

Another approach: the molecular formulas. Let's consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible functional groups: ester, ether, maybe a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But with the IR data, the 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740, which is a bit higher than 1700. But maybe the ester is conjugated, lowering the carbonyl stretch to 1700. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. But then where's the 1650? Maybe an aromatic ring. So if it's an aromatic ketone, the 1650 could be the aromatic ring's C=C stretch.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which might suggest an O-H. So maybe an alcohol with a ring and a double bond. But then the 1700 and 1650 peaks—maybe a carbonyl group, but where? If it's an alcohol with a carbonyl group, that would fit. But wait, an alcohol would have a broad O-H peak, which aligns with the IR. But then what about the 1700 and 1650? Maybe a ketone or ester alongside the alcohol? Wait, but the molecular formula is C6H10O. An ester would require more oxygens. So maybe a ketone and an alcohol. But that would require two O's, which this option has only one. Because formula is C6H10O: one O. So that can't be. So perhaps this option can't have two carbonyl groups, since it has only one O. So maybe option B is not the right choice.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: 2. So two DoU. Possible structures: an ester (which requires an O and a carbonyl group), and perhaps a double bond. So maybe an ester with a double bond. The IR's 1700 could be the ester carbonyl, and 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, or an aromatic ring. The presence of vinyl H in NMR suggests a double bond, which would fit with the DoU. Also, the broad peak in IR (3000) could be an O-H from an alcohol, but if it's an ester, maybe it's an alcohol elsewhere, but in the ester structure, the O is part of the ester group. Wait, no: esters are R-O-CO-O-R. No, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R, so the O is in the ester group. So maybe the broad peak is not from an O-H but from something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol, but with ester groups. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, but then the formula would have more O's. Because a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which has two O's in the COOH group. Wait, the formula C6H10O2 has two O's. So that could fit a carboxylic acid. Then the IR would show a broad O-H around 3000, the carbonyl at ~1700. But what about the 1650 peak? Maybe an aromatic ring, which isn't present here. So perhaps that's not it.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. That could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So if the formula has one DoU due to a double bond, that would fit. Then the O could be an alcohol. So the structure could be an allylic alcohol, but what about the IR peaks?

The IR shows 1700 and 1650. If the compound is an alcohol with a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an aldehyde), that could explain those peaks. But wait, with the formula C6H12O, how would that work? For a ketone, the O is in the carbonyl, so the formula would have only one O. So that could be possible. But then, the 1700 would be the ketone. What about the 1650? Maybe an aromatic ring (but that would require more DoU), or maybe the compound has a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester, but that would require more O's. So perhaps option D isn't the right choice.

Wait, but the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. That's more likely an O-H group, such as an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. So if the compound is an alcohol with a carbonyl group, that could fit into options A or C, since they have two O's.

But wait, the options: A is C6H12O2 (two O's), C is C6H10O2 (two O's). Let's compare them.

If the compound is an ester (which has a carbonyl), then the IR would show the ester's carbonyl at around 1700-1750, which fits the 1700 peak. The 1650 peak could be due to conjugation, perhaps an adjacent double bond. The presence of vinyl H in NMR supports a double bond.

Let's think about option C: C6H10O2. Molecular formula suggests an ester plus a double bond. So maybe it's an allyl ester, something like CH2=CHCH2COO-R. Or perhaps a cyclic ester, but
