Okay, I'm trying to solve this sigmatropic rearrangement question. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. The type of rearrangement depends on the number of atoms involved. For example, Cope is a [3,3] shift, and Claisen is also [3,3], but sometimes they can be different based on the structure.

The question has three reactions, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C. Let me take them one by one.

Starting with Reaction 1:

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat → A

Wait, the reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. When I see "1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine", that's like a molecule where both the 1 and 2 positions (since it's ethan-1-amine) have methoxy groups. So the structure is OMe2CH2NH2? Wait, no, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So it's (MeO)2CH-NH2.

But wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (MeO)₂CHNH₂. Now, when I look at the other reactant, but-3-en-2-ol. Its structure is CH₂CH(OH)CH₂CH₂? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂=CHCH(OH)CH3? Or is it CH₂CH₂-OH with a double bond at position 3. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂=CHCH2CH₂OH? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH₂=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, but the butenol has four carbons. Let's see: but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Structure of but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, but butenol has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH₂CH₂ with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? That can't be because but only has four carbons. Wait, maybe it's CH₂=CHCH₂-OH? No, because position 2. Oh, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂CH₂CH₂-OH with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, but numbering starts such that the double bond is as low as possible. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH₂=CHCH(OH)CH3? But that's five carbons. Oh wait, but but has four. So it's probably CH₂CH(OH)CH₂CH₂? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH₂=CH
