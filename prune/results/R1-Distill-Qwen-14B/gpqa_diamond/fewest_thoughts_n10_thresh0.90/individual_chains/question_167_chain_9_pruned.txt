Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about calculating non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, let's break it down.

So the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, which are minimum uncertainty states. But when you combine them with coefficients, like in a superposition, the state can become non-Gaussian, which is what the question is about.

The problem asks me to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I'm a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

First, I need to construct the density matrix rho for the given state. The state is |psi>, so rho would be |psi><psi|. But the state is a superposition of two coherent states. I remember that the density matrix of a coherent state |alpha> is Gaussian. But when you have a superposition, the density matrix becomes non-Gaussian because it's a mixture of terms involving |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are orthogonal if alpha isn't zero.

The reference Gaussian state tau is probably the best Gaussian approximation to rho. But wait, how's tau defined here? The question says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, I'm not exactly sure what the reference Gaussian state would be. Maybe the reference is the Gaussian state that best approximates the given state in some sense, like the one with the same first and second moments.

Wait, but for the relative entropy measure to compute non-Gaussianity, del_b, the idea is that the non-Gaussian state's entropy minus the reference Gaussian's entropy gives the non-Gaussian part. But if the state rho is already Gaussian, then del_b would be zero, right? Because then tau would be equal to rho, and their entropies would be the same.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The problem says the state is a superposition of two Gaussian states. The state itself is non-Gaussian, so rho is non-Gaussian. But the reference Gaussian state tau could be the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as rho. Or maybe it's something else. But I'm not exactly sure how tau is chosen here. This is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a thermal state or a squeezed state, but I think in this context, the most straightforward approach is to assume that tau is the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in some metric, possibly the one with the same first and second moments. Alternatively, maybe the state is a cat state, which for certain parameters could be a Gaussian state. Wait, no. Wait, a cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it non-Gaussian, but for specific parameters, like when the phase phi is zero, it might not be. Hmm, no, I think the cat state is non-Gaussian in general.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on how to compute tau. Let me think about the specific parameters given. The problem says phi is -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5.

Wait, let me compute N first. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Wait, alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. exp(-2 * 0.25) is exp(-0.5) which is approximately 0.6065.

Sin(2 phi) when phi is -pi/4 is sin(-pi/2) which is -1.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So N is about 0.6275. So the state |psi> is ( cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> = [ (0.7071)|0.5> - (0.7071)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, but wait, the state is a superposition of two coherent states. So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

Now, the question is about the non-Gaussianity. The relative entropy measure is given as del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. So del_b is the difference in entropy between the non-Gaussian state and the reference Gaussian state. If rho is non-Gaussian, then del_b should be positive or negative depending on how the entropy compares.

Wait, but wait. Von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho). So if rho is a pure state, S(rho) is zero. But wait, no, wait: if rho is pure, then rho is a projector, so rho^2 = rho, and S(rho) would be zero. But wait, our state |psi> is a pure state because it's a normalized state, so rho is a projector, so S(rho) is zero. But the reference state tau is a Gaussian state, which may be a mixed state, so S(tau) would be positive.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Because |psi> is a pure state, rho is pure, so S(rho)=0. But tau is a Gaussian state. If tau is a pure Gaussian state, then S(tau)=0 as well. But if tau is the closest Gaussian approximation, perhaps it's a mixed state. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. The relative entropy measure here is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. Wait, but rho is a pure state, so Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b would be negative of Tr(tau ln tau), which is negative of S(tau). Hmm, that can't be right, because that would mean del_b is negative.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me read the formula again. The problem says, "the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]".

Wait, but von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = -Tr(rho ln rho). So Tr(rho ln rho) is -S(rho). So, del_b = [ -S(rho) ] - [ -S(tau) ] = S(tau) - S(rho).

Since rho is a pure state, S(rho) is zero, so del_b = S(tau).

But wait, if tau is a Gaussian state, which could be mixed, S(tau) is positive. So the del_b would be positive, which would imply that the non-Gaussianity is positive. But I'm not sure if this is the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is computed with the reference state as the Gaussian that is closest in some sense to rho. Maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy, and the difference is what gives the non-Gaussianity.

But I'm getting stuck on how to compute tau. Maybe I should think about specific properties of the state. Let's see, the state is a superposition of two coherent states. The Wigner function of such a state is known to have negative regions, which is a hallmark of non-classicality, hence non-Gaussianity. So the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b should be positive.

But how do I compute tau? Another approach is to note that for a two-mode state, the Gaussian states are completely determined by their first and second moments. But for a single-mode state like a coherent state, the Gaussian states are determined by their first moment (the mean) and the covariance matrix.

Wait, but in the case of a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix would have higher-order moments that are non-Gaussian. The reference Gaussian state tau would have the same first and second moments as rho, perhaps. So tau would be the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian rho.

If that's the case, then the non-Gaussianity would be the difference in the von Neumann entropy between rho and tau. But wait, if tau has the same first and second moments, but rho has higher non-Gaussian moments, then the entropies would differ.

But calculating the von Neumann entropy for a general Gaussian state isn't straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps for a specific case, like when the state is a cat state, there's an analytic expression for the non-Gaussianity.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy between rho and tau is being considered, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for a state that's a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix can be written in terms of the density matrices of the coherent states and their cross terms.

The density matrix rho = |psi><psi| is (1/N^2) [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] [ <alpha| cos(phi) + < -alpha| sin(phi) ].

Expanding this, rho = (1/N^2) [ cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) | -alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) ( |alpha><-alpha| + | -alpha><alpha| ) ].

So the density matrix is a mixture of the two coherent states plus some off-diagonal terms.

But coherent states are orthogonal, right? So |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal if alpha isn't zero. Wait, no, coherent states are not orthogonal unless alpha and beta are such that their difference is large enough. Wait, wait, for different alphas, |<alpha| beta>|^2 = exp( - |alpha - beta|^2 ). So for alpha and -alpha, the overlap is exp(- |2 alpha|^2 ), which is non-zero but small for large alpha.

Wait, let me compute <alpha| -alpha> = exp( - (alpha + (-alpha))^2 / 2 ) ? No, wait, the inner product <alpha|beta> is exp( - (alpha - beta)^2 / 2 ). So <alpha| - alpha> = exp( - (2 alpha)^2 / 2 ) = exp(- 2 alpha^2 ). So yes, for alpha=0.5, this is exp(-0.5) = approx 0.6065.

So the two coherent states are not orthogonal, so their outer products contribute cross terms.

Now, the problem is to calculate the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. I'm a bit stuck because I'm not exactly sure how to compute tau. Maybe I should think about whether the state is actually Gaussian. If it's a Gaussian state, then del_b is zero. But the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian, so del_b should be positive.

Wait, but wait! Wait, I remember that for a specific case when the state is a coherent state, it's Gaussian. But when you have a superposition, like (|alpha> + |-alpha>)/sqrt(2), that's a cat state, which is non-Gaussian. So in this case, the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b would be positive.

But how do I compute it? Perhaps I can look for a formula or a known value for the non-Gaussianity of a cat state.

Wait, the options include 0, which suggests that maybe the del_b is zero. Is there any scenario where that would be the case?

Wait, if the state is a Gaussian state, then the non-Gaussianity would be zero. But when is the state Gaussian? Maybe if the superposition parameters result in a Gaussian state.

Wait, but I thought that a superposition of coherent states is always non-Gaussian. Wait, no, that's not correct. For example, if the superposition is symmetric, like |alpha> + |-alpha>, then the state might not be Gaussian, but perhaps under certain conditions, it's Gaussian. Or maybe for phi = 0 or pi/2, the state becomes a coherent state again.

Wait, let me think. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N.

If phi is 0, then |psi> becomes |alpha> / sqrt( cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ) ), since N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ), which for phi=0, sin(0)=0, so N=1. So |psi> becomes |alpha>, which is a Gaussian state. So in that case, del_b would be zero because rho is Gaussian, so tau equals rho, and S(rho)-S(tau)=0.

In this problem, phi is -pi/4. So sin(2 phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N is sqrt( 1 - exp(-2 alpha^2) ), which for alpha=0.5, as computed before, is sqrt(1 - 0.6065) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, but if I plug phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, is the state Gaussian?

Wait, for phi=-pi/4, the coefficients are cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. So the state is (sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 | -0.5> ) / N.

But is this state Gaussian? I don't think so. Because it's a superposition of two different coherent states, which are Gaussian but in different positions. The overall state is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: perhaps when the state has a certain symmetry, it could be a Gaussian state. But in this case, I don't think so. So del_b should be positive.

But the options given include A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

So D is zero, which would occur only if the state is Gaussian. So is there any chance that for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is Gaussian?

Wait, perhaps in some cases, the state ends up being a squeezed coherent state or some Gaussian state. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe when sin(2 phi) is zero, the state is Gaussian, but that's when phi is 0 or pi/2, which is not the case here.

So perhaps the del_b is not zero here, so the answer can't be D.

But without knowing how to compute tau, I'm not sure how to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero, but I don't see why.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the relative entropy measure del_b is zero because the state is a cat state, which has a Gaussian Wigner function? No, that's not correct. Cat states have non-positive regions in the Wigner function, which makes them non-Gaussian.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps for certain parameters, the state is actually a Gaussian state. Let me think.

Wait, when the state is a coherent state, it's Gaussian. But when it's a superposition of two coherent states, it's non-Gaussian. So unless the superposition coefficients result in the state being a coherent state, it's non-Gaussian. But when would the superposition be a coherent state?

Let me compute |psi> for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

The state is [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / N.

As I computed before, cos(-pi/4)= sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4)= -sqrt(2)/2. So the state is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / N.

But can this state be written as another coherent state? Let me see. Suppose it can be written as |beta> for some beta. Then,

|beta> = [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / N.

But that's not possible because a coherent state is a single eigenstate. So the state |psi> is a superposition of two different coherent states, which implies it's non-Gaussian. Therefore, del_b should not be zero, so option D is incorrect.

But without knowing how to compute tau, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the completely mixed state. But that seems unlikely because the relative entropy would then be large.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy is zero because the state is Gaussian. But I thought it wasn't. Alternatively, perhaps for a specific choice of phi and alpha, the state is Gaussian.

Wait, let me think again. For a state to be Gaussian, it must be a Gaussian state, which includes coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. If the density matrix can be written in terms of Gaussian functions, then it's Gaussian.

But the density matrix for a superposition of two coherent states, like |psi> = (|alpha> + |-alpha>)/sqrt(2), is non-Gaussian. So in this problem, since phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b should not be zero.

But the options have D)0, which would imply that del_b is zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in thinking about the relative entropy. Let me think again.

The formula is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau) = [ S(tau) - S(rho) ] because Tr(rho ln rho) is -S(rho), and Tr(tau ln tau) is -S(tau).

Wait, no, wait: the formula given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

But S(rho) = -Tr(rho ln rho), so Tr(rho ln rho) is -S(rho).

Similarly, Tr(tau ln tau) = - S(tau).

So del_b = (- S(rho)) - (- S(tau)) ) = S(tau) - S(rho).

Now, if rho is a pure state, S(rho) = 0. So del_b = S(tau).

But how is tau defined? If tau is the closest Gaussian approximation to rho, perhaps tau has lower entropy than rho, making del_b positive.

Wait, but if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0, so del_b = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau).

But if the state rho is non-Gaussian, then the relative entropy would be positive, implying that the non-Gaussianity is positive. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is being considered as the entropy of the non-Gaussian state minus that of the Gaussian reference. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be easier. Maybe when the state is a coherent state (which is Gaussian), the
