Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. The astronomers did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Wait, that probably relates to their temperatures. Oh right, because the peak wavelength of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to temperature (Wien's law). So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same.

Hmm, but wait, does that mean their temperatures are equal? Because if both have the same peak wavelength (λ_max), then according to Wien's displacement law, T = constant / λ_max. So yes, same λ_max implies same temperature. So both stars have the same temperature.

Then, the problem says they computed the luminosity of Star_1 as greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. The options are all around 2.2 or so. Let me think about what factors contribute to luminosity.

I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Where R is the radius, T the temperature, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

But wait, in this case, both stars have the same temperature because their peak wavelengths are the same. So T1 = T2. So the luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)². Because L ∝ R² T⁴, and T is same, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 would be 2.25 times that of Star_2. But wait, the options don't have 2.25 as the correct answer? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So option A is 2.25. So why would the answer not be A?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, but how does that affect luminosity? Hmm. Radial velocity is about the speed of the star moving towards or away from us. But in terms of luminosity, which is intrinsic brightness, I think radial velocity doesn't directly affect it. Unless it's about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength, but wait, the problem already accounted for that because they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which should have accounted for any Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, but the observed peak wavelength would be shorter. However, the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So any Doppler shift must have been corrected for. Or perhaps the temperature calculation already took that into account.

Wait, but let me think again. If a star is moving towards us at a high speed, like Star_2 with 700 km/s, the light would be blueshifted. So the observed wavelength would be λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) approximately, for non-relativistic speeds. But velocities of 700 km/s are about 0.23% the speed of light (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So v is small compared to c, so an approximation might be applicable.

But wait, the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the stars' rest wavelengths are different, but due to their velocities, they appear at the same observed wavelength. But wait, how would that affect their temperatures? Because the peak wavelength is determined by both the star's temperature and any Doppler shift.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the observed wavelength is a combination of the star's rest frame and the Doppler shift. So the rest wavelength (λ_rest) is determined by Wien's law based on the star's temperature. The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if the star is moving towards us, v_r is negative, so the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted). Or is it (1 - v/c) or (1 + v/c)? Let me think: the Doppler effect formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) for transverse motion, but if it's moving directly towards us, the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) where β = v/c, when moving away. Wait, no: when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs > λ_rest. The formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but that's for transverse motion. Alternatively, for motion directly towards or away, the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ), but that's more complicated. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, we can approximate λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. So if the star is moving towards us, v_r is negative (approaching), so λ_obs is less than λ_rest.

But in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the rest wavelengths of the two stars are different because of their different velocities.

Wait, but the problem states that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So this observed wavelength is the same. Hmm.

Wait, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is the same for both stars. So, if each star has a different rest wavelength, but because of their velocities, their observed λ_max is the same.

Wait, but let me think about it. Each star emits at a certain λ_rest based on its temperature. But if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_obs would be shorter than its λ_rest, and Star_1 is at rest, so λ_obs for Star_1 is equal to its λ_rest. So if Star_2's λ_rest is longer than Star_1's, but due to its velocity, the observed λ_obs for both ends up being the same.

Wait, let's make this more concrete. Let's denote:

For Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (since v1 =0 )

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c )^-1 (since v2 is positive when moving away, but wait, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, the problem says Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. But which direction? Because radial velocity could be positive (moving away) or negative (moving towards). So if Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, that could mean moving away (if positive) or towards (if negative). But the problem doesn't specify direction, just says 700 km/s. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. But perhaps the sign doesn't matter because the product would end up affecting the observed wavelength.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So let me write the equations:

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (since v1=0 )

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c )^(-1) [assuming v2 is moving away, so positive velocity leads to redshift, longer λ_obs. If it's moving towards, v2 would be negative, so 1 + v2/c would be less than 1, leading to a shorter λ_obs.]

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c )^(-1 )

But wait, the problem says that the stars' luminosities were computed based on their blackbody radiation. So when they say the luminosity, they would be using their rest frame parameters, not the observed. Hmm, no, perhaps the observed flux and the apparent brightness is affected by their velocities. Wait, but in the problem statement, the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming the stars are black bodies. So perhaps they accounted for the observed parameters, including any Doppler shifts.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, let's get the given data:

- R1 = 1.5 R2
- M1 = 1.5 M2
- λ_obs1 = λ_obs2
- v1 = 0, v2 = 700 km/s
- Compute L1/L2.

But we need to find L1/L2 based on their luminosities as black bodies.

But wait, the problem states that the luminosity was computed as a black body. So each star's luminosity is based on their radius, temperature, etc.

But wait, the temperature they have is the rest frame temperature, not the observed temperature. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think the key here is that the observed wavelengths (λ_obs) are the same, so:

Using Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. But this λ_max is the rest frame λ_max. But if the star is moving, the observed λ_obs would be different. So the observed maximum for each star is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), but the sign depends on direction.

Wait, let me think again.

The peak wavelength emitted by the star (λ_emit) is given by λ_emit = b / T. But due to the star's velocity, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs > λ_emit. If moving towards us, v_r is negative, so λ_obs < λ_emit.

In this problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's assume that it's moving away from us, so v_r is positive. So λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700e3 / c )

But c is ~3e5 km/s, so 700e3 / 3e5 = 0.002333... So (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333.

So setting λ_obs1 = λ_obs2:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1.002333)

But λ_emit is from Wien's law: λ_emit = b / T. So λ_emit1 = b / T1, λ_emit2 = b / T2.

Thus,

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * 1.002333

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.002333

So T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002327) [using 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x]

So T1 ≈ T2 (0.997673). So the temperature of Star_1 is a bit lower than Star_2.

Wait, but that's confusing because earlier I thought the temperatures were the same. That's where I might have gone wrong before. Because if the observed wavelengths are the same, but the stars have different velocities, their actual temperatures (in their rest frames) are different.

So, the initial assumption that T1 = T2 was incorrect. Because the observed λ_obs is the same, but the emitted λ_emit is different due to Doppler shift.

So the stars' rest temperatures are different. So now, the problem is more complicated because their temperatures are not the same. So I can't just assume T is the same.

So, with that in mind, let me re-express the problem.

We have:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 * (1 + v1_r / c ) = λ_emit1 (since v1_r is 0) → λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2_r / c ) → since v2_r is 700 km/s, assuming it's moving away, so λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 )

We have λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 )

Which gives λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 7e2 / 3e5 ) → 7e2 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333.

So 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

So λ_emit1 = 1.002333 * λ_emit2.

But λ_emit is given by λ_emit = b / T.

So,

λ_emit1 = (b / T1) = 1.002333 * (b / T2 )

So,

1/T1 = 1.002333 / T2 → T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So T1 ≈ 0.99767 T2.

So the temperatures are different. So Star_2 is hotter? Because T1 < T2.

Wait, no. Wait, since T1 = T2 / 1.002333, which is less than T2. So T2 is higher.

Now, let's get back to the luminosity.

Luminosity L is given by L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 ) → ( (R1/R2)^
