Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

Alright, the problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I remember that the potential energy of a charge in an electric field is something like U = qV, where V is the potential at the point where the charge is located.

Wait, but in this case, we have multiple charges. The setup involves 12 charges fixed at a distance of 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. Since all particles are identical and have charge 2e, let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly.

So, point P is where one charge is fixed. The other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the system.

I think the total potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Oh wait, but since the system is isolated, and all charges are fixed except maybe the one at P? Wait, no, the 13th is fixed as well. So all charges are fixed except maybe the 12 are constrained to be at 2m. Hmm, no, the 13th is fixed at P, so all 13 are fixed, I think.

Wait, no, no. The 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So P is a point where the 13th charge is fixed. So the 12 are each located at 2 meters from P. So the 13th is at P, surrounded by 12 others each at 2m away.

So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge at P. So, the potential energy of each of these 12 charges in the electric field of the charge at P would be U = qV, where V is the potential at 2m due to the charge at P.

Wait, but wait. Each charge is 2e. So the charge at P is 2e. The 12 charges are each 2e as well. So the potential at 2m due to the charge at P is V = k*(2e) / (2), since distance r is 2 m.

Wait, the formula for electric potential (V) is V = k * q / r. So V here is (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (2e) / (2 m). Let me compute that.

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 coulombs. So 2e is 3.204e-19 C. So V = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19) / 2.

Let me compute that. 8.988e9 divided by 2 is about 4.494e9. Multiply by 3.204e-19 C: 4.494e9 * 3.204e-19 = let's see, 4.494 *3.204 is approximately 14.393, and 1e9 * 1e-19 is 1e-10. So 14.393e-10 = 1.4393e-9 volts.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is 2e. So the potential energy U for each charge is U = q * V. So U = (2e) * V.

Wait, but wait. The charge is 2e, and V is calculated as (k * 2e)/(2). So U for each charge is 2e * (k * 2e)/(2). Let me compute that.

Wait, 2e * V = 2e * (k*2e/(2)) = 2e * (k e) )= 2e * k e.

Wait, since 2e * (k*2e)/(2) is same as e * k * 2e. Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Let me compute V first. V = k * Q / r. Here, Q is the charge at P, which is 2e. So V = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (3.204e-19 C) / (2 m).

Calculating that: 8.988e9 * 3.204e-19 = let's see. 8.988 *3.204 is about 28.794, and 1e9 *1e-19 is 1e-10. So 28.794e-10 is 2.8794e-9. Then divide by 2 m: 2.8794e-9 / 2 = 1.4397e-9 volts.

So each of the 12 charges at 2m is in a potential V of approximately 1.4397e-9 V.

Each charge is 2e, so the potential energy U for one charge would be U = (2e) * V.

So U = (3.204e-19 C) * 1.4397e-9 V.

Calculating that: 3.204e-19 * 1.4397e-9 = let's multiply 3.204 by 1.4397: approx 4.617, and the exponents are 1e-28. So 4.617e-28 J. But this is for one charge.

Wait, but wait a minute, the potential energy of a charge in a potential is U = qV. But in this setup, when you have multiple charges, you have to consider each pair and sum their contributions.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the system's total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Since the 13th charge is fixed at P, the only interactions are between the 13th and each of the 12 surrounding charges.

So, each of the 12 charges at 2m from P has a potential energy due to the 13th charge (at P). So the potential energy for each is (2e) * V, where V is the potential at 2m due to the charge at P.

So for each of the 12, U_i = (2e) * (k*(2e)/(2m)).

Wait, that's (3.204e-19 C) * (8.988e9 N·m²/C² * 3.204e-19 C / 2 m).

Wait, but that's the same as each U_i being (2e) * (k * 2e)/(2 r). So for each, it's (2e) * (k*2e)/(2*2) because r is 2 meters.

Wait, no. Wait, the potential at the location of each of the 12 charges is due to the 13th charge (at P). So V = k*(2e)/(2 m). So for each of the 12 charges, U = q * V = (2e) * (k*(2e)/(2 m)).

Let me compute that: (2e) * (k*(2e)/(2)) ) = (2e) * (k e). So that's 2e * k e.

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C. So 2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So 2e * k * e is (2e) * (8.988e9) * e.

So plugging in the numbers:

2e = 3.204e-19 C,

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C²,

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So U_i = (3.204e-19 C) * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19 C) 

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that.

Wait, 2e multiplied by (k*2e/(2)) would be (2e) * (k * 2e)/(2) ) = (2e) * (k e).

Because 2e * (k * 2e) / 2 = (2e) * (k * e) * (2/2) = (2e) * (k e).

Wait, no: 2e * (k * 2e) / 2 = (2e) * (k * e) )= 2e * k * e.

So U_i = 2e * k * e.

So substituting in the numbers: 2e = 3.204e-19 C, k=8.988e9 N m²/C², e=1.602e-19 C.

So U_i = (3.204e-19) * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19).

Let me compute that step by step.

First,
