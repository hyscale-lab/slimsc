Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. 

So, the setup is that there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that, so 2e. And their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything related to motion here.

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So, I imagine point P is where one charge is, and the other 12 are all located 2 meters away from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, right? I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their position. Since they're all the same sign (since each is 2e), bringing them closer would require work against the repulsion.

Wait, but wait a second. The system is isolated, so no external fields are influencing it. Also, all the charges are the same. So each charge is 2e, which is positive since e is positive. So all charges are positive, leading to repulsion.

I think the formula for the electric potential energy (U) between point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988×10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

But when considering a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for n charges, each pair contributes to the total.

Wait, but in this case, the setup is a bit specific. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P. So I need to calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, no. Because all the 12 are at 2 meters from P, but are they arranged in some way? Like, are they all at 2 meters from P and each
