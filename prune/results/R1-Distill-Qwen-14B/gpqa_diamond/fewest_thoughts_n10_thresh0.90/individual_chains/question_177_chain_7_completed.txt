Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about two stars and their luminosities. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.

They say the stars radiate as black bodies, so I should use the black body radiation laws here. The question is about the ratio of their luminosities, L1 over L2. The options are A to D, with values around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm. Let me think about the factors that determine luminosity. I remember that the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, for each star, L is proportional to R² times T⁴. Since R is given for Star_1 (1.5 R2), and T is temperature, which I think I can find from the wavelengths where they appear brightest.

Wait, the peak wavelength. Oh right, the peak of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K).

If both stars have the same λ_max, that would mean their temperatures are the same. Wait, is that right? Because the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 = T2. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait. The stars have different velocities. Oh wait, the velocities are radial velocities—so that's the Doppler shift. Oh, right! Because the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted. So the λ_max observed isn't the same as the star's actual λ_max.

Wait no. The question says that the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So what's observed is the same λ_max for both stars. But due to their velocities, their actual λ_max (intrinsic) must be different.

Wait, so let's think. The observed wavelength is λ_observed. The intrinsic (rest) wavelength is λ0. The Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, actually the formula depends on whether it's approaching or receding. Oh, right, the relativistic Doppler effect. The formula is λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but when v is much less than c, this approximates to 1 + v/c for small velocities. But 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c is ~3e5 km/s, so 700 is ~0.0023c, which is small but not negligible—wait, maybe the non-relativistic approximation is okay? Hmm, but for precise calculations, perhaps I should use the exact formula.

Alternatively, since both stars' λ_max as observed are the same, but their velocities are different, their actual temperatures must be different. Because the observed λ_max depends on both the actual temperature and their velocity.

So for Star_1, radial velocity v1 is 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

For Star_2, v2 is 700 km/s. Let me think about the Doppler shift. If Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter than its rest wavelength. If it's moving away, longer. So if Star_1's λ is at the same observed λ as Star_2, but Star_2 is moving, their rest wavelengths must be different.

Wait, but wait. Let's get the signs right. The radial velocity is given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 for Star_2. So, which direction? The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and 2. So Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But is it moving towards or away? The problem doesn't specify, but since the observed λ_max is the same, the shift due to velocity must compensate for the temperature difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each star, the observed wavelength is the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Wait, but Star_1 has v_r1 = 0, so λ_obs1 = λ1_rest.

Star_2 has v_r2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving towards us. So the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest wavelength by a factor dependent on velocity.

So for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ), where β = v/c.

Wait, no. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) when moving towards us. Because when approaching, the wavelength is blueshifted (shorter).

But if Star_2 is moving away, then λ_obs would be longer than λ_rest. But in this problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So Star_1's λ_rest equals Star_2's λ_obs.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, that would mean:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

And since λ_obs depends on the star's velocity, we can find the relationship between their temperatures.

So, let's write down the equations.

For Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v=0), and from Wien's law, λ1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c) , approximately, assuming non-relativistic speeds. Wait, no. Wait, the Doppler shift formula can be approximated as:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c) when the source is moving towards us (v_r is negative if moving away). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the signs. Let me clarify.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ), where β = v/c.

But if the star is moving towards us, v is positive, which makes β positive. So sqrt( (1+β)/(1-β) ) is greater than 1, so λ_obs is longer than λ_rest. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, if a source is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, so λ_obs would be shorter than λ_rest. So maybe I should think in terms of the formula when v is positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) when moving towards, which would be less than λ_rest, i.e., blueshift.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact Doppler shift formula. But since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed carefully.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) )  when the source is moving away from us. Because when the source moves away, the wavelength is stretched (redshifted). So when the source moves towards us, it's blueshifted, so λ_obs < λ_rest, which would imply that the formula in that case is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ), since beta is positive. Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but let me think about β positive when moving away. So when the source moves away, the observed wavelength is longer, and the formula would be λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ), because (1+β)/(1-beta) is greater than 1, so sqrt is larger than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

But that's the approximation for non-relativistic speeds. So, for small v/c, the Doppler shift is approximately λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving towards us (v_r positive), the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted), so λ_obs = λ_rest (1 - v_r / c ), perhaps? Or another way around.

Wait, no. The Doppler effect formula in terms of velocity:

If the source is moving towards the observer with speed v, the observed frequency is higher, so wavelength is shorter. So, λ_obs = λ_rest * (c - v) / c ≈ λ_rest (1 - v/c ), for small v/c.

Wait, but that's for non-relativistic speeds. So for v << c, the approximation would be λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps I should proceed with the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relationship between observed wavelength and temperature, considering the Doppler shift.

So, for each star, we can relate their observed wavelength to their intrinsic temperature, considering their velocities.

Given that λ_obs is same for both, let's set up the equations.

For Star_1:
λ1_obs = λ1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2:
λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

But since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is v, we can calculate the Doppler factor.

Wait, but whether Star_2 is moving towards or away affects the sign. The problem only states the radial velocity is 700 km/s, but doesn't specify the direction. Hmm, but in the problem, both stars have the same observed λ_max. So, perhaps Star_2's rest wavelength is either longer or shorter than Star_1's, depending on whether it's moving towards or away.

Wait, but let's think about the Doppler effect. If Star_2 is moving away from us, its observed wavelength would be longer than its rest wavelength. If moving towards, observed wavelength is shorter.

But in the problem, Star_1's observed wavelength is λ1_rest, and Star_2's observed wavelength is λ2_obs. So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, λ2_obs < λ2_rest. If moving away, λ2_obs > λ2_rest.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So we have λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

Let me write that as equation:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

But λ2_obs is related to λ2_rest via the Doppler shift.

So, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), but wait, I'm not confident about the exact formula. Let me think again. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * ( 1 + v_r / c )

Where v_r is the radial velocity, positive when moving away.

So, if Star_2 is moving away with v_r = 700 km/s, then λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + 700e3/(3e5)) = λ2_rest * (1 + 0.002333...) ≈ λ2_rest * 1.002333.

But in this case, since Star_1's λ_rest is λ1_rest = λ_obs, and Star_2's λ_obs = λ1_rest.

So, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c) = λ1_rest.

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T, so λ1_rest = b / T1, and λ2_rest = b / T2.

Substituting, (b / T2) * (1 + v/c) = (b / T1).

The b's cancel out, giving:

(1 + v/c) / T2 = 1 / T1.

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

Wait, but wait. If Star_2 is moving away, then the observed wavelength is longer than λ2_rest. So, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c).

Because when moving away, λ_obs is longer, so (1 + v/c) is a factor greater than 1.

So, if both observed wavelengths are the same, then λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

Substituting,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

The b's cancel,

1/T1 = (1 + v/c) / T2.

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c).

Hmm, so T1 is smaller than T2 if v is positive.

Wait, but that would mean Star_1 is cooler than Star_2. But Star_1 is more massive and larger. Hmm, maybe that's possible, but let's proceed.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the direction of the velocity. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 - v/c) [assuming small v/c].

Wait, but because the problem says Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but doesn't specify direction. Hmm, but the way the problem is presented, perhaps the radial velocity is for Star_2 is moving towards us. Because otherwise, if it's moving away, the observed λ would be longer, which would require Star_1 to have a higher temperature, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't specify, but the way the Doppler shift affects the observed λ_max must be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to take the Doppler shift into account, leading to the relationship between T1 and T2.

So, let me proceed with the equation T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c), where v is 700 km/s.

Wait, but wait, in this case, I assumed Star_2 is moving away, so v is positive. But if Star_2 is moving towards us, then v would be negative, which would affect the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should model it more accurately.

The Doppler effect formula for wavelength when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

But that's for any velocity, but when v is positive when moving away. So if the source is moving towards the observer, v is negative.

Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c ) when v << c, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the Doppler formula. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Since the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, we can write that λ1_max_obs = λ2_max_obs.

But λ_max_obs for each star is given by the Doppler-shifted λ_max_rest.

So for Star_1, since v=0, λ1_max_obs = λ1_max_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2, λ2_max_obs = λ2_max_rest * Doppler_shift_factor.

So, λ2_max_obs = λ2_max_rest * (sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )) )

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, then the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest, so λ_obs is less than λ_rest. So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, v is positive, and the factor would be less than 1. Therefore, λ2_max_rest would be larger than λ2_max_obs.

Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving away, v is positive, and the observed wavelength is longer, so λ2_max_obs > λ2_max_rest.

But in our problem, λ1_max_obs = λ2_max_obs. So,

λ1_max_rest = λ2_max_obs.

Which is,

(b/T1) = (b/T2) * (sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )) )

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Rearranged,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Hmm, so T1 is less than T2 if v is positive (moving away), or greater than T2 if v is negative (moving towards).

But since the problem says the observed λ_max is the same, let's assume that Star_2 is moving towards us. So v is negative, making (1 - v/c) larger than (1 + v/c) because v is negative.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on this. Let's perhaps calculate the numerical value first.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.002333...

So,

sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

= sqrt( (1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333) )

= sqrt( (0.997667) / (1.002333) )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

0.997667 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99535.

So the square root is sqrt(0.99535) ≈ 0.99767.

Therefore,

T1 = T2 * 0.99767.

So T1 is approximately 0.99767 times T2, which is a bit less than T2.

Hmm, so Star_1's temperature is slightly lower than Star_2's.

But wait, let's think again about the Doppler shift. If Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ), which is less than λ_rest, because the source is moving towards us. So, in this case, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the Doppler shift formula correctly. The formula for observed wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) )

Which is less than λ_rest.

So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Since λ1_rest = λ1_obs (Star_1's v is zero), and λ2_obs = λ1_obs,

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b/T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, now that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, let me check:

If λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ),

And λ1_rest = λ2_obs,

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But λ1_rest = b/T1, λ2_rest = b/T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Divide both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is same as,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Ah, that's a key point. So, T1 is larger than T2 by a factor of sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, that makes sense. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so the observed λ_max is smaller than λ2_rest. But since λ1_rest is the same as λ2_obs, which is smaller, that would imply that Star_1's temperature is higher than Star_2's, because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers again.

v = 700 km/s, c=3e5 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700/(300000) = 0.0023333...

So,

(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) = (1.0023333) / (0.9976667) ≈ 1.0047175.

Then sqrt of that is sqrt(1.0047175) ≈ 1.002352.

So, T1 = T2 * 1.002352.

So, the temperature of Star_1 is about 0.235% higher than that of Star_2.

Now, to find the luminosity ratio, L1/L2.

Luminosity is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴ ) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Because 4πσ cancels out.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )² * (T1^4) ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

Simplify R terms: (1.5)^2 = 2.25, R2² cancels.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But T1 = T2 * 1.002352, so,

T1 / T2 = 1.002352.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (1.002352)^4 ≈ ?

Calculate 1.002352^4.

First, compute 1.002352 squared:

1.002352^2 = approx (1 + 2*0.002352) + (0.002352)^2 ) ≈ 1 + 0.004704 + 0.00000553 ≈ 1.0047095.

Then, square that to get the fourth power:

(1.0047095)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.0047095 + (0.0047095)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.009419 + 0.0000222 ≈ 1.009441.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.009441.

Putting it all together,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009441 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00944.

Let me compute 2.25 * 1.00944.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25

2.25 * 0.00944 ≈ 0.02124.

So total is approximately 2.25 + 0.02124 ≈ 2.27124.

Wait, that's approximately 2.271.

But looking at the options, the closest is option B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I approximated too much.

Let me compute (1.002352)^4 more accurately.

1.002352^2:

Let me compute 1.002352 * 1.002352.

= (1 + 0.002352)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002352 + (0.002352)^2.

= 1 + 0.004704 + 0.00000553.

= 1.00470953.

Now, square that:

(1.00470953)^2.

= (1 + 0.00470953)^2.

= 1 + 2*0.00470953 + (0.00470953)^2.

= 1 + 0.00941906 + (approx 0.00002217).

= 1.00944123.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.00944123.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00944123 = ?

2.25 * 1.00944123.

Let me compute 2.25 * 1.00944123.

Compute 2 * 1.00944123 = 2.01888246.

Then 0.25 * 1.00944123 = 0.2523603075.

Add them: 2.01888246 + 0.2523603075 = 2.2712427675.

So approximately 2.2712.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Our calculation gives about 2.27, which is not exactly matching any option. The closest is option D) ~2.23, but that's a bit lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation. Let me re-examine the Doppler formula.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should use the exact Doppler formula for observed wavelength.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

where β = v/c.

So, with β = 700e3 / 3e5 = 0.002333...

So,

sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) = sqrt(0.997667/1.002333) ≈ sqrt(0.995352) ≈ 0.99767.

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest * 0.99767.

But since λ_obs is the same for both stars, we can write:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * 0.99767.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 0.99767.

But λ_rest = b / T, so,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 0.99767.

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (0.99767) / T2.

So,

T1 = T2 / 0.99767 ≈ T2 * 1.00235.

Which is the same result as before.

Hmm, so the same calculation follows, leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.27.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my assumption about the direction of the velocity.

Wait, what if Star_2 is moving away from us? Then v is positive, and the Doppler shift would cause λ_obs to be longer than λ_rest.

So, let's recast the problem:

If Star_2 is moving away, then λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ), where β = v/c = 0.002333...

So,

sqrt( (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333) ) = sqrt(1.002333 / 0.997667) ≈ sqrt(1.004717) ≈ 1.00235.

So,

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * 1.00235.

Since λ1_rest = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.00235.

Then, using λ_rest = b/T,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 1.00235.

So,

1/T1 = 1.00235 / T2.

Which means,

T1 = T2 / 1.00235 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So, T1 is now lower than T2.

Then, the luminosity ratio would be:

L1/L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( T1/T2 )^4.

R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Compute 0.99767 squared: approximately 0.99535.

Squared again: (0.99535)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23, which matches option D) ~2.23.

But wait, why the difference? Because whether the star is moving towards or away changes the calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

In the problem, the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. Radial velocity can be positive (moving away) or negative (moving towards). The problem doesn't specify, but the observed λ_max is the same. So, perhaps in this case, Star_2 is moving away, leading to a lower T1.

But wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So, Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but we don't know if it's moving towards or away.

Hmm, this is a problem because the outcome depends on the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the radial velocity is the speed, regardless of direction, but in that case, the Doppler shift would have to account for whether the velocity is towards or away.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as |v|, but without knowing the direction, there are two possibilities.

But in this scenario, when Star_2 is moving away, the ratio L1/L2 is about 2.23 (option D), and when moving towards, it's about 2.27, which isn't an option.

Looking back at the options, option B is ~2.32, which is higher than 2.25. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, let me recompute that part.

In the scenario where Star_2 is moving away:

T1 = T2 * 0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2) = 0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4.

Compute this accurately.

First, 0.99767^2:

= (1 - 0.00233)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 = 0.9953454.

Then, (0.9953454)^2 = ?

= (1 - 0.0046546)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0046546 + (0.0046546)^2.

≈ 1 - 0.0093092 + 0.00002166.

≈ 0.9906925.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9906925.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9906925 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23, matching option D.

Alternatively, if the star is moving towards us, the ratio is higher.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same, and the radial velocity is 700 km/s. Since the problem doesn't specify the direction, perhaps the intended approach is to assume that the star is moving away, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the observed λ_max higher, so that Star_2 is moving away, leading to a lower temperature and lower luminosity, but wait no, Star_1 is larger. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem states that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by the factor we're calculating.

In the case where Star_2 is moving away, L1/L2 is about 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, the problem says the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2. So, if L1/L2 is 2.23, then yes.

But looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So, the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is therefore:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the observed wavelengths
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law, the intrinsic wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star 1, there is no radial velocity (\( v_1 = 0 \)), so its observed wavelength is equal to its intrinsic wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1}
\]

For Star 2, the observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted due to its radial velocity (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate the two expressions:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Canceling \( b \) and solving for \( T_1 / T_2 \):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

### Step 2: Substituting values
The speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), and \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Substituting into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}} \approx \sqrt{0.99535} \approx 0.99767
\]

Thus:

\[
T_1 \approx 0.99767 T_2
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the luminosity ratio
The radii of the stars are related as \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Substituting into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1/R_2)^2 (T_1/T_2)^4}{1}
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

First, calculate \( (1.5)^2 \):

\[
(1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

Next, calculate \( (0.99767)^4 \). Approximating step-by-step:

\[
(0.99767)^2 \approx 0.99535
\]

\[
(0.99535)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

Finally, substitute back:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with the options
The calculated luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.23 \), which matches option **D**.
