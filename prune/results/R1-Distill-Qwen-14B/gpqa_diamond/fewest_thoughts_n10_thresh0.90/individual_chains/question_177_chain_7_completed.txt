Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

Okay, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. From spectroscopy, their brightest wavelengths are the same. Oh, wait, and their radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The options are given, and I need to find which factor it is.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but what do we know about their temperatures? Oh right, the peak wavelength at which a star emits is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So same λ_max implies same T? Because if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, T would be same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that's their peak emission wavelengths. So yes, same T. So T1 = T2.

So then, luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴). But since T1=T2, the Ts cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5 R2)^2 / R2² = (2.25 R2²)/R2² = 2.25. So the ratio would be 2.25, which is option A. But wait, the options have some other numbers like 2.23, 2.32, etc. Did I miss something?

Wait, but the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, but wait, does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength would be different. But the problem says they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, perhaps their emitted wavelengths are same, but due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelengths could be different. Wait, no, the question says the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are same. So maybe the observed λ_max is same for both. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, I need to think about this. If a star is moving relative to us, the observed wavelength is shifted. So if one star is moving towards us (say, Star 2 with radial velocity 700 km/s), the observed wavelength would be blueshifted, meaning shorter than the emitted wavelength. And Star_1 has zero velocity, so its observed wavelength is same as emitted.

But the problem states that the brightest wavelengths are the same as observed. So for both stars, the observed λ_max is same. So, let's denote lambda_observed1 = lambda_observed2. But Star_2 is moving, so its emitted lambda_emitted2 would be different.

So, let's model this. Let me denote the actual emitted wavelength of each star as λ1 and λ2. The observed wavelengths would be λ1_obs and λ2_obs. For Star_1, since radial velocity is zero, λ1_obs = λ1. For Star_2, moving away or towards us with velocity v, the observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v/c), but wait, wait, the exact formula depends on whether the star is moving towards or away. Radial velocity is positive when moving away, I think. So, if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is away from us (since it's positive, perhaps?), the observed wavelength would be longer than emitted. But wait, the problem says the observed λ_max is same for both stars. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So in the observed frame, their λ_max is the same. So Star_1 has λ1 = λ_observed, and Star_2 has λ2_observed = λ_observed. But Star_2's λ2_emitted would be different.

So, let me think. For Star_2, its actual emitted λ2 is such that when shifted by its velocity, it's the same as Star_1's λ1.

Wait, let me write the Doppler shift formula. The observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but wait, no, that's for transverse Doppler effect. Or is it the other way around for radial velocity?

Wait, no, the relativistic Doppler shift formula for radial velocity (source moving away) is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). But wait, that's an approximation when v is much smaller than c, which is the case here. Because 700 km/s is 0.00233c (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So the approximation should be okay.

So, the exact formula for wavelength shift is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c)

But wait, if the star is moving away, v is positive, so λ_obs is longer. If moving towards, v is negative, λ_obs is shorter.

But the problem says Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The question doesn't specify direction, but let's assume it's moving away, so v is positive. So λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

Similarly, Star_1's λ_obs1 is λ_emit1, since v1=0.

But the problem states that λ_max for both observed is same, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c)

Taking v2 as 700 km/s.

But then, the actual emitted wavelengths are different. Because λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

But wait, from Wien's law, λ_emit is inversely proportional to temperature. So:

λ_emit = b / T.

So, for Star_1: λ1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: λ2 = b / T2.

But from the Doppler shift, λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). So:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c) )

Which implies T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Wait, but wait, v2 is 700 km/s, which is directed away, so v is positive. So (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, meaning T1 is less than T2.

Wait, no, because T1 = T2/(1 + v2/c) → so T1 is smaller than T2.

Wait, but wait, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, implying that the emitted wavelength was shorter. Because if you move away, the emitted light is redshifted. So λ_obs = λ_emit*(1+v/c). So for Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, its emitted λ is smaller than the observed λ. But since the observed λ is same as Star_1's, λ_emit2 must be smaller than λ_emit1.

So, from that, since λ_emit1 = λ_emit2*(1 + v/c), and λ_emit = b/T, so:

λ1 = (b / T1) = λ2*(1 + v/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

So T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, but earlier when I thought that T1 and T2 are same, that was wrong because I didn't consider the Doppler shift. So, in reality, the temperatures are different, because the observed λ_max is same, but the emitted λ_max is different due to Doppler effect.

So, in that case, the luminosity ratio will depend on the temperatures as well as the radii.

So the earlier approach was incorrect because I assumed same T, which isn't the case.

So, let me redo the problem.

We have:

L1 = 4πσ R1² T1⁴

L2 = 4πσ R2² T2⁴

We need to find L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴)

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 ) )

= ( (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4

So, if I can find T1/T2, then I can compute the ratio.

Earlier, from the Doppler shift, I have λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v/c )

But λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

=> T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c )

So, the ratio (T1/T2)^4 = [ 1 / (1 + v/c ) ]^4

So, putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v/c)]^4

We can compute 1 + v/c. v is 700 km/s.

v = 700,000 m/s

c = 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s.

Wait, wait, c is approximately 3×10^8 m/s. So 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s.

v/c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333...

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.023333...

So, [1/(1.023333)]^4 ≈ let's compute this.

First, 1.023333 is 1 + 0.023333.

Let me compute 1/(1.023333) ≈ 0.977.

But perhaps I should be more precise.

Let me compute 1.023333 ≈ 1 + 0.023333.

Compute 1.023333^4.

Wait, but wait, we have [1/(1.02333)]^4 = [1 / (1 + 0.023333)]^4 ≈ (using binomial approx for 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x + x² -x^3 + ... )

But since x is small, perhaps it's easier to compute 1.023333^4 and then take reciprocal.

Alternatively, compute (1.023333)^4.

Let me compute step by step:

1.023333^2 = ?

1.023333 * 1.023333.

Let me compute 1.023333 * 1.023333:

= (1 + 0.023333)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.023333) + (0.023333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.046666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.04721.

Wait, but more accurately, 1.023333 * 1.023333:

Let me compute:

1.023333 × 1.023333:

= 1 × 1 = 1

1 × 0.023333 = 0.023333

0.023333 × 1 = 0.023333

0.023333 × 0.023333 ≈ 0.000544

Adding all:

1 + (0.023333 + 0.023333) + 0.000544 = 1 + 0.046666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.04721.

So (1.023333)^2 ≈ 1.04721.

Now, square that again for the fourth power:

(1.04721)^2 = ?

1.04721 × 1.04721.

Compute:

1 × 1 =1

1 × 0.04721 = 0.04721

0.04721 × 1 = 0.04721

0.04721 × 0.04721 ≈ 0.002229.

Adding up:

1 + (0.04721 + 0.04721) + 0.002229 = 1 + 0.09442 + 0.002229 ≈ 1.096649.

So (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.09665.

Thus, [1/(1.023333)]^4 = 1/(1.09665) ≈ 0.9119.

Wait, let me compute 1/1.09665:

1.09665 ≈ 1.0966.

So 1.0966 ≈ 1 + 0.0966.

1/ (1 + 0.0966) ≈ 1 - 0.0966 + 0.0966² - ... but perhaps it's easier to compute 1 /1.0966.

Let me compute 1.0966 * 0.91 → 1.0966 *0.9 = 0.98694, 1.0966 *0.01=0.010966 → total 0.997906. Close to 1. So 0.91 would give 0.9979. So 0.912 would give 1.0966 *0.912 → let's see: 1.0966 *900 → 987.94, 1.0966 *12=13.1592 → total 987.94 +13.1592=1001.0992 → 1001.0992 /1000 = ~1.0011.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 1/1.0966 ≈ 0.912.

So (1/(1.023333))^4 ≈ 0.912.

So going back to L1/L2:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.912) ≈ 2.25 * 0.912.

Compute 2.25 *0.9 = 2.025; 2.25 *0.012=0.027 → total 2.052.

So approximately 2.052.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Wait the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, none of the options are near 2.05. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that Star_2 is moving towards us, making its observed λ shorter, but then the Doppler factor would be (1 - v/c) instead of (1 + v/c), which would change the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. But radial velocity is positive if moving away, I think. So if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 is higher than its emitted λ_max.

But the problem states that both observed λ_max are same.

So, for Star_1, λ_obs = λ_emit1.

For Star_2, λ_obs = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c).

Set them equal: λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c).

From Wien's law, λ_emit = b/T → T_emit1 = b / λ_emit1.

So,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v/c)

→ (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

So T1 is lower than T2.

So in the luminosity ratio, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1 / T2)^4.

But R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1^2 / R2^2 = 2.25.

(T1/T2) = 1/(1 + v/c ) → so (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c )]^4.

So I need to compute [1/(1 + v/c )]^4.

v =700,000 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

v/c=700000/3e8 = 0.00233333...

So 1 + v/c = 1.00233333...

So 1/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99768.

Compute 0.99768^4.

Compute 0.99768^2 first.

0.99768^2 = (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00232 + (0.00232)^2.

= 1 - 0.00464 + 0.00000538.

= 0.99536 + 0.00000538 ≈ 0.995365.

Now, square that again: (0.995365)^2.

= (1 - 0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.004635) + (0.004635)^2.

= 1 -0.00927 + 0.0000215.

≈ 0.99073 + 0.0000215 → ≈0.9907515.

So 0.99768^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.25 *0.99075 ≈ 2.228.

So about 2.228.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct option is D.


To determine the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi \sigma R^2 T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Radii
From the problem, \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Substituting this into the ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}
\]

### Step 2: Relating Temperatures
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. For Star_1, \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} \) because its radial velocity is zero. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = b / T \):

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

Canceling \( b \) and rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v/c}
\]

### Step 3: Substituting Values
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} = 700,000 \, \text{m/s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{700,000}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
1 + \frac{v}{c} \approx 1.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99768
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The ratio \( (T_1 / T_2)^4 \) is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99768)^4
\]

First, calculate \( (0.99768)^2 \):

\[
(0.99768)^2 \approx 0.99536
\]

Then, square the result:

\[
(0.99536)^2 \approx 0.99075
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.99075
\]

### Step 5: Final Luminosity Ratio
Substitute into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99075 \approx 2.228
\]

### Step 6: Matching to Options
The closest option to \( 2.228 \) is:

**D) ~2.23**

Answer: D
