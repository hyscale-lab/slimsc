Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me take a deep breath and try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about electric fields around a conducting sphere with a cavity. I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges and electric fields.

Alright, let's read the problem again. So, there's a spherical conductor of radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, point P is outside the conductor, so L is greater than R. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, which is also bigger than R. The angle between l and s is theta. So, l and s form an angle theta.

I remember that when a conductor has a cavity, the charges inside the cavity influence the charges on the conductor. But wait, the conductor itself is uncharged. So, when the +q charge is inside the cavity, how does that affect things?

I think the key here is to use the concept of electrostatic shielding. But wait, no, wait a minute. Electrostatic shielding says that charges inside a cavity of a conductor don't affect the outside, but that's when the conductor is a shell without any charge. But in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, let me think again. The conductor is initially uncharged. When you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Because the conductor's material is a conductor, the charges will redistribute to cancel any internal fields. So the inner surface has -q, and since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, is that right? The total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface must have -q (to cancel the field from +q inside), leaving the outer surface with +q because the conductor's total charge is zero.

So, now, the question is about the electric field at a point outside the conductor. So, from a point outside, the electric field would be due to the charges on the outer surface. But wait, the outer surface has a charge of +q, and it's distributed on the outer shell.

But wait, how is this outer charge distributed? If the conductor is a sphere, the outer charge would distribute uniformly, right? Because in electrostatics, charges on a conductor's outer surface tend to arrange themselves as uniformly as possible, especially if the conductor is a sphere.

So, the point P is outside, so the electric field there should be as if the charge +q were located at the center of the spherical conductor. Because the induced charges will produce a field outside the conductor as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but in this problem, the cavity isn't at the center. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh right, that's given. So the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is off-center.

Hmm, so how does that affect the induced charges? Let me think. If the cavity is off-center, then the inner surface charge won't be uniformly distributed. It will be more concentrated in the direction opposite to the cavity's center. Because the +q charge is inside the cavity, which is displaced, so the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge distribution that's not uniform.

But wait, does that affect the outer surface's charge distribution? The outer surface's charge distribution is determined by the total charge on it, which is +q. But if the conductor is a sphere, the outer charge will distribute uniformly regardless of the inner charge's distribution. Because the outer surface is exposed to the outside, and any external influences (like symmetry) would make the outer charge uniform.

Wait, so the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere. So, the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So for the electric field at P, it's as if the charge is at the center, right? So E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²). Because that's the field from a point charge at the center.

But let me look at the options. Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So is that the correct answer?

Wait, but the problem says that point P is a distance l from the center of the cavity. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

So, the setup is a conductor of radius R, with a cavity of radius r, whose center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. The point P is outside, at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, so perhaps the field due to the induced charges is being considered. But wait, the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's uniformly distributed. So the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, regardless of where the inner charge is placed, the outer induced charge is uniform. So the field outside would be as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

Alternatively, perhaps the displacement of the cavity affects the inner charge distribution, but not the outer. So the outer charge is still uniformly distributed.

So, the electric field at point P would be as if the charge were at the center, giving E = kq / L², where k is 1/(4πε₀).

Looking back at the options, option B is that.

But wait, let me think again. The point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's induced charges' effect on P is to produce a field as if the charge were at the center. So, yes, option B.

But why are the other options present?

Option A: (l - s cosθ)^2 in the denominator. That seems like application of the law of cosines for the distance between P and the cavity's center. But the field is due to the outer charge, which is at the conductor's center, not the cavity's.

Option C: (l + s cosθ)^2. Maybe if the point were inside, but we are outside.

Option D: 1/l². That would be the field if the charge were at the cavity's center, but the field outside is due to the conductor's outer charge, not the cavity's charge.

So the correct answer should be option B, E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / L²).


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor and Cavity Properties**: The spherical conductor of radius $R$ has a small cavity of radius $r$ inside it, with the cavity's center separated by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center. The conductor is initially uncharged, but a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.

2. **Induced Charges**: The presence of $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to cancel the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality.

3. **Outer Surface Charge Distribution**: The outer surface of the conductor, being a sphere, distributes its charge $+q$ uniformly. This uniform distribution ensures that the electric field outside the conductor is the same as if all the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

4. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: Point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is therefore determined by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor, which acts as if it were a point charge located at the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field is:

   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: This suggests a dependence on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center, not on the cavity's geometry.
   - **Option B**: This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, as the field is determined by the uniformly distributed charge $+q$ on the outer surface.
   - **Option C**: This suggests a dependence on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: This assumes the electric field depends on $l^2$, which would be valid if the charge were located at the cavity's center. However, the field outside the conductor is due to the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface, not the cavity's charge.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
