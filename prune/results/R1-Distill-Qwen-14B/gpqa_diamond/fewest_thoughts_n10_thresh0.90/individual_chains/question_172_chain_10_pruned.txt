Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me break it down. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. And the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Right, and in this case, E_i minus E_j is the energy difference given, which is 1.38e-23 J.

But wait, the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So which way does that go? I should clarify what's meant by "twice as excited." Oh, probably the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1/n2 = 2/1, where n1 is the excited state population for star_1, and n2 is the same for star_2.

Wait no, wait. The way the problem is phrased: iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the excitation is higher, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy level. So the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher. But wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." Hmm, perhaps it's the ratio of the excited level to a lower level.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the problem. It says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So for a particular energy level E, the number of atoms in E in star 1 is twice that in star 2. So n1(E) / n2(E) = 2.

But wait, the Boltzmann factor is for the ratio of populations between two energy levels. Let me suppose that E is the excited state and E_0 is the ground state. Then, the ratio n(E)/n(E_0) = exp( - (E - E_0)/(k T) ). So for each star, we can write their respective ratios.

So
