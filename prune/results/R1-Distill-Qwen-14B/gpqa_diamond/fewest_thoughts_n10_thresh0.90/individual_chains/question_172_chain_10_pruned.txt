Okay, I need to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms is described by the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of atoms in different energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, n_i and n_j are the populations of two energy levels, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In the problem, both stars have iron atoms in the same energy levels. So E_i and E_j are the same for both stars, but maybe the energy difference is given. Wait, the problem states the energy difference between the considered levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, no, that's given as the same for both stars, right? Because the energy levels are the same in iron atoms regardless of the star.

So, for star_1 and star_2, the ratio of the excited states (n_i) to the ground state (n_j) would be different. They've observed that n_i/n_j for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, actually, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. So n_i for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n_i)_1 / (n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i)_2/(n_j)_2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (since it's the same element and same levels), so g_i/g_j is a constant ratio for both stars.

Wait, but in this problem, the question is about the same energy transition but different stars
