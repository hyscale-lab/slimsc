Okay, so I have this question about the density matrix and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. The given matrix is ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). 

Wait, I think I should break this down. The |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors. So each term is a projector onto the respective basis states. Adding them together and multiplying by 1/2. What does that look like as a matrix?

I know that |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in the (2,2) position. Adding them together gives a 2x2 identity matrix. Multiplying by 1/2 gives the matrix [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, a qubit state is represented as a point on the surface of a unit sphere. But wait, that's for pure states. This is a density matrix, so it's a mixed state.

Density matrices have certain properties. They must be positive semi-definite, have trace 1, and be Hermitian. Let's check: The trace of ρ is (1/2 +1/2)=1, so that's good. It's diagonal, so obviously Hermitian.

But how does this translate into the Bloch sphere? Oh right, for a density matrix, the Bloch vector (which is the geometrical position) can be found using the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space.

Wait, so let's express ρ in that form. Our ρ is diagonal, so when we write it as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z )/2. Since σ_x and σ_y are the Pauli matrices, which have off-diagonal elements and zeros on the diagonal. Let's write it out.

The Pauli matrices are:
σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So substituting into the expression:
( I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2
= (1/2)[ [1,0;0,1] + r_x [ [0,1],[1,0] ] + r_y [ [0,-i],[i,0] ] + r_z [ [1,0],[0,-1] ] ]

Let me compute the matrix element-wise.

The diagonal elements:
Top left: (1/2)(1 + r_z)
Top right: (1/2)(0 + r_x - i r_y)
Bottom right: (1/2)(1 - r_z)

The given ρ is diagonal, so all off-diagonal elements must be zero. So:

Top right element of our expression is (r_x - i r_y)/2. In ρ, the off-diagonal elements are zero. So:

(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 => r_x =0 and r_y=0.

Because for a complex number a + ib to be zero, both a and b must be zero. So r_x and r_y are zero.

Now the diagonal elements must match. The given ρ has (1/2, 0; 0, 1/2) on the diagonal. So:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z=0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 =1/2 → same result.

Wait, so r_z is zero? That would mean the vector r is (0,0,0). Because r_x and r_y are zero, and r_z is zero.

So the geometric position is at the origin. But wait, does that make sense? Because the density matrix I have is a completely mixed state. I think the completely mixed state in 1 qubit corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. Because the pure states are on the surface, and the completely mixed state is the center.

So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

which simplifies to a diagonal matrix:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general density matrix, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the given \( \rho \), we equate it to the general form:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), the off-diagonal elements must vanish, leading to \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). The diagonal elements yield \( r_z = 0 \). Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This makes sense because the completely mixed state lies at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \( r = (1,1,0) \)** — Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) \( r = (0,0,1) \)** — Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \( z \)-axis.  
**C) \( r = (0,0,0) \)** — Correct, as this is the origin in the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state.  
**D) \( r = (1,1,1) \)** — Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Answer: C
