Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. Pure states are density matrices that are projections, like |ψ><ψ|, and mixed states are statistical mixtures of those.

Wait, so in this case, ρ is the average of |0><0| and |1><1|. Both of those are projectors, and since they're being averaged with equal weights (1/2 each), this must be a mixed state. So it's like a 50% chance of being in state |0> and 50% in |1>.

Now, the question is asking about the geometrical position in qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that means exactly. Qubit space is two-dimensional, right? Because a qubit can be in a superposition of |0> and |1>, which are the basis states.

Wait, but when we talk about the geometrical representation of density matrices, I think it's related to the Bloch sphere. Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a way to represent all possible states of a qubit. Each point on the unit sphere corresponds to a pure state, and the interior points represent mixed states.

The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is a vector r = (x, y, z) such that ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, I need to express the given ρ in this form and then find r.

Let me write down ρ again:

ρ = ½ (|0><0| + |1><1| )

Hmm, |0><0| is a projector. Let me recall what the Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

I also know that I, the identity matrix, is [[1,0],[0,1]].

So, the standard form is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

Wait, no, more accurately, the general form when you express a density matrix in terms of the Pauli matrices is ρ = (I + r·σ) / 2, where r is a vector (rx, ry, rz), and r·σ is the dot product of r with each of the Pauli matrices.

So, to find r, I need to express ρ in this way.

Let me compute each term. First, let's compute |0><0| and |1><1|:

|0><0| is the matrix [[1, 0],[0, 0]]
|1><1| is [[0, 0],[0, 1]]

Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2)(I), because I is the sum of |0><0| and |1><1|.

So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So I have ρ = I/2.

Now, putting this into the standard form:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ.

So r·σ = 0. Hmm, that means each component of r must be zero, because when you add the three Pauli terms with their coefficients rx, ry, rz, the sum is zero only if all coefficients are zero.

So rx = 0, ry = 0, rz = 0. So r is the zero vector: (0,0,0).

Wait, but looking back, I think that makes sense. The state ρ = I/2 is the completely mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, that's the origin, because the Bloch vector is zero. So the geometrical position is the origin in the qubit space.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer must be option C.

But wait, let me double-check. Because another way to look at it is to compute the density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector. If the Bloch vector is zero, then the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which matches ρ given here.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is a statistical mixture of the pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal weight \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. A density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector.

For the given \(\rho\), we note that \(|0\rangle\langle 0| = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(|1\rangle\langle 1| = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\). Adding these gives the identity matrix \(I\), so 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Substituting this into the standard form, we have 

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting \(I\) gives 

\[
0 = \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}.
\]

This implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in Bloch sphere coordinates. Therefore, the geometrical position of \(\rho\) in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
