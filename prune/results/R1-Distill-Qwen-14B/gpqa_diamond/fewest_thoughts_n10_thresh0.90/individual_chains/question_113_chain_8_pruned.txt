Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopy techniques. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec. I'll need to analyze each of these to figure out the structure and then the formula.

Starting with the FTIR. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. That usually indicates O-H stretching, right? Like from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the question says it's a very broad peak. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because the -OH is more acidic and the hydrogen is more loosely held. Alcohols also have broad peaks, but maybe less so. Hmm, I'm not sure yet, but let's keep that in mind.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group. Like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than the typical carbonyl. Maybe that's an conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring with something else. Wait, but if there are two peaks around there, that might suggest there are two different carbonyl groups. Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated C=C or an aromatic ring's stretching.

Looking at the NMR next. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond somewhere. That makes me think of something like an ester, maybe with an alkene group. Or perhaps a ketone with a double bond nearby.

The Mass Spec data shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm a bit rusty on mass spec, but I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: for example, a fragment of CH3O would be 31, but 45 is higher. Oh wait, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 30 (for two CH3 groups) plus 15 (O) is 45. No, wait, (CH3)2O is actually 31 (each methyl is 15, O is 16; 15*2 +16=46? Wait, no. 15*2=30 +16=46). Wait, maybe I'm confusing that. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from an ester. For example, an acetyl group (CH3CO-) is 60, but maybe losing something. Or perhaps the fragment is from a ketone or another group.

Wait, another thought: 45 is the mass of CH2(OH)COOH, but that's probably not relevant. Alternatively, maybe it's the tropylium ion, which is C7H7+, but that would be 91. Wait, maybe I'm thinking of something else. Alternatively, when you have a molecule breaking apart, a common fragment is the methyl group or ethyl, but 45 is higher than that.

Let me think about the possible formulas given the options. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So all are C6 with varying H and O.

Given the FTIR has a broad O-H, perhaps two oxygen-containing groups. Because the carbonyl is at 1700, which suggests maybe an ester or ketone. Also, the presence of a broad O-H could mean a hydroxyl group, but if there are two oxygens, maybe it's an acid or an ester.

Wait, if there are two O-containing groups, like an ester (which has an O in the carbonyl and another in the ester oxygen), that would fit O2 in the formula.

Looking at the options, options A and C have two oxygen atoms.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule must have a double bond. That suggests either an alkene or possibly an aromatic ring. But the FTIR doesn't indicate any strong peaks in the aromatic region (like around 1500 cm^-1 for C=C in benzene). Wait, the FTIR shows a peak at 1650, which is lower than typical alkenes (1650 could be conjugated double bonds or maybe a carbonyl. Wait, but a carbonyl is 1700, so maybe the 1650 is a conjugated double bond.

So, the molecule has a double bond and a carbonyl group. That points towards maybe an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

In that case, a structure like CH2CHCOO-R might fit. But how does that help with the formula?

Looking at the molecular formulas:

A) C6H12O2: degrees of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But if we have an ester and a double bond, that's two degrees. Wait, wait, maybe I need to recalculate. Let me compute for each option.

For option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So either one ring or one double bond, or a combination. But earlier I thought it has a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl (ester), which would be two rings/bonds. Hmm, maybe that's a problem because the degree of unsaturation is only 1.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X +N)/2. For option A: 2*6=12+2=14; 14 -12=2; 2/2=1. So one degree, which could be a double bond and a ring? Or more accurately, either one double bond + one ring, or two double bonds, etc. Wait, no: each degree is a ring or a double bond. So one degree would be a single double bond or a single ring. So if the compound has both a double bond and a carbonyl, that's two degrees. Wait, but that's impossible under option A, which only has one degree.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's think about each option's degrees of unsaturation.

Option A: C6H12O2 → DOU = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond.
Option B: C6H10O → (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, two double bonds, or a combination.
Option C: C6H10O2 → (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, two double bonds, etc.
Option D: C6H12O → (14-12)/2=1. One ring or double bond.

Wait, but in the IR, we have a carbonyl (1700 cm^-1) which is a double bond (C=O), and a peak at 1650 which is possibly a conjugated double bond. So that's two double bonds. So the compound must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.

Which options have DOU ≥2? Let's see:

Option B: DOU 2
Option C: DOU 2
Option A: 1 → no
Option D: 1 → no

So the correct formula must be either B or C.

Now, looking back, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, likely O-H. So the compound must have an -OH group.

Looking at the options:

Option B: C6H10O → that's a possible alcohol structure (like cyclohexanol, but with more unsaturation). But with two degrees of unsaturation, it could have a double bond and an -OH.

Option C: C6H10O2 → two oxygens. So maybe an ester (O2) and a double bond.

Wait, but the Mass Spec has a fragment at m/z =45. Let's think about what options could give that.

m/z 45 is (probably) a molecular ion or a fragment.

What's the molecular weight of each option?

Option A: C6H12O2 → 6*12=72 +12=12 → 72+12=84 +32 (for O2) → 72+12+32=116? Wait wait, O is 16. So O2 is 32. So 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 32 for O2: 72+12+32=116. So molecular weight is 116 for option A.

Option B: C6H10O → 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 16 → 72+10+16=98. So molecular weight is 98.

Option C: C6H10O2 → 6*12=72 +10 +32 → 72+10=82 +32=114. So 114.

Option D: C6H12O → 6*12=72 +12=84 +16= 96? Wait, 72+12=84, plus O is 16 → 84+16=100. So molecular weight of 100.

The mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So what could that be?

Looking for a fragment with m/z 45. Let's think about the possible structures.

For example, if the compound is an ester, the ester group is O-CO-O. When the molecule breaks apart, perhaps it loses a fragment.

Wait, for option C: C6H10O2. Let's imagine the structure. Maybe it's something like methyl propenoate, but that's C4H6O2. Wait, but for C6, maybe something like methyl pentanoate? Or perhaps an ester with a double bond.

Wait, let's think about the ester: R-O-CO-R'. The molecular formula for an ester is Cn+1+m H2(n+m)+2 O2. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the ester formula is CnH2nO2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's think of specific possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the fragment at 45 comes from a CH3CO group. The fragment CH3CO would have a molecular weight of 43 (CH3CO is 12+1*3 + 12 +16 → 12+3=15 +12+16= 43). Wait, but 43 is close to 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a larger fragment.

Alternatively, m/z 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule, such as (CH3)2CHO, which is 45. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of something. For example, if the molecule has a CH2CH2 group, perhaps losing that as a fragment.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for the unknown is one of the options. Let's think about the possible structures.

If the
