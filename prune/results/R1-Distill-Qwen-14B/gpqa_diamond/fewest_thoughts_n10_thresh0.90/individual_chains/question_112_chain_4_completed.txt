Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. Okay, the problem is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is a linear combination of |up> and |down> states. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i) respectively. 

First, I remember that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is the Sz operator. The Sz matrix is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>. 

But the question isn't directly about Sz. It's asking about another operator whose matrix elements A_ij are given as ħ/2 when i≠j and zero otherwise. Wait, that's an unusual structure. Let me think. So, the matrix would be 2x2 since it's dealing with spin-1/2 states. So the matrix looks like this:

[0   ħ/2]
[ħ/2 0 ]

Hmm, that's interesting. So this operator is actually the Pauli X operator multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So A is (ħ/2) * X. 

The problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A, and also the average value of A.

Wait, but when we measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of A. Since A is proportional to Pauli X, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the eigenvalues of A should be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2.

But wait, no. Wait, the operator A is given with A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and zero otherwise. So yes, it's (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenvalues are indeed ± ħ/2.

But perhaps I should proceed more carefully. Let me think about the eigenstates of A. The Pauli X matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1, and its eigenstates are the |+x> and |−x> states. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of X, just scaled by a factor. 

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, which can be written as superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). 

Alright, so the state |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, but I need to find the probabilities of measuring in the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |−x>. Alternatively, perhaps the operator A has eigenstates that are orthogonal, so to find the probability, I can express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the probabilities by considering the eigenstates of A. Let me think about the process.

First, I need to normalize |alpha>. Because the coefficients are complex, and probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes.

So, let me compute the norm of |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is |alpha> / sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A, then take the squared magnitude.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, which are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, perhaps I should check the exact forms. Since the eigenstates of X (and hence of A) are |+x> and |−x>, and they can be written as (|up> ± |down>)/sqrt(2). So yeah.

So, the probability of measuring a particular eigenstate is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude when you project |alpha> onto that eigenstate.

Let's compute the projection onto |+x> first.

Let me write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> is:

(1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 - i) * (1/sqrt(2)) )

Wait, because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product is (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2).

Factor out 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

So the sum is (1+i + 2 -i) = 3. So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, wait: (1+i) from the coefficient of |up>, and (2 -i) from |down>. So the inner product is (1+i + 2 -i) multiplied by 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))).

Simplify the numerator: 1 +i +2 -i =3. So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the squared magnitude is (3^2)/(14) )=9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, the projection onto |−x> is (1+i) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2 - i)*(-1/sqrt(2)).

So that's (1+i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i).

Multiply by 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The squared magnitude is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357142...

Wait, but wait a second. Those two probabilities should add up to 1. Let me check: 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. Which would be 9/14≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357—so the closest match would be option A, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7

Wait, but another thing to compute is the average value of the operator A. So let's think about that.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Wait, since A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of the Pauli matrices.

Alternatively, I can compute this expectation value directly.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

So to compute <A>, I need to calculate <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let me write |alpha> as a column vector. Since |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1), then |alpha> is:

[ (1+i) / sqrt(7) ]
[ (2 -i) / sqrt(7) ]

So the bra vector is the conjugate transpose:

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7)   (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So A|alpha> would be:

[ 0   ħ/2 ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] 
[ ħ/2 0 ]   [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute each component:

Top component: 0 * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Bottom component: (ħ/2) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0 * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7).

So A|alpha> is [ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) , (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Now, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of |alpha> with A|alpha>.

Which is (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7).

Factor out (ħ/2) * (1/7):

Term1: (1 -i)(2 - i)
Term2: (2 +i)(1 +i)

Compute Term1: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i² = -1)
= 1 -3i.

Term2: (2)(1) + (2)(i) + (i)(1) + (i)(i)
= 2 + 2i +i +i²
= 2 +3i -1
= 1 +3i.

So adding Term1 and Term2: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So the inner product is (ħ/2) * (2) /7 = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A's average is ħ/7. But I should double-check the calculation.

Wait, when I compute Term1 and Term2, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate Term1 and Term2.

Term1 is (1 -i)(2 -i):

=1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
=2 -i -2i +i²
=2 -3i -1 (since i² =-1)
= (2-1) -3i = 1 -3i.

Term2 is (2+i)(1+i):

=2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
=2 +2i +i +i²
=2 +3i -1
=1 +3i.

So adding Term1 and Term2: 1-3i +1+3i=2.

So yes, that's correct. So <A> is (ħ/2) * (2)/(7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Now, looking back at the probabilities: 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571. So the options are:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.

That matches the first two values approximately. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36. The average is ħ/7, which matches option A.

Wait, but let me check the other options. For example, option D has average 2ħ/sqrt(7). That would be much larger than ħ/7, so that's not it. Option C has average ħ/sqrt(7), which is larger than what I calculated.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the average calculation? Because I thought A is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli X operator. The expectation value of X in |alpha> is <X>, and then <A> would be (ħ/2) <X>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute <A> directly.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value of A is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of the Pauli X matrix in the state |alpha>.

So, the expectation value of X is [ ( <up| + <down| ) /sqrt(2) ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) ].

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute <X> as (1/sqrt(7))² times [ (1+i) (2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 -i) ].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The Pauli X matrix in the computational basis is [[0,1],[1,0]], so for a state |psi> = a|up> + b|down>, the expectation value of X is (a^* b + b^* a) / (|a|^2 + |b|^2) * (|a|^2 + |b|^2) ?

Wait, no. The expectation value is <psi| X |psi>.

So |psi> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, but normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So <psi| X |psi> is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * X * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiplying this out:

First element of <psi| is (1-i)/sqrt(7), second is (2+i)/sqrt(7).

X applied to |psi> swaps the components:

X * |psi> = ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) * |up> + ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) * |down>

So then the inner product is:

(1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7)

Which is [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] /7.

As I computed earlier, that's [ (1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) ) + (2*1 + 2*i +i*1 + i*i) ) ] /7.

Which is [ (2 -i -2i + (-1)) + (2 +2i +i + (-1)) ] /7.

Simplify each part:

First part: 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second part: 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Adding together: 1 -3i +1 +3i = 2.

So the expectation value of X is 2/7.

Therefore, the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7, which matches what I found before.

So the average value of A is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 (about 0.64) and 5/14 ≈0.357 (about 0.36), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the probabilities. Because the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, and the inner product for |+x> is 3/sqrt(14), whose square is 9/14, which is about 0.6428. The other is 5/14, about 0.357. So the first probability is higher.

So the options must have the order of probabilities as 0.64 and 0.36, which is option A.

So the answer should be A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given state and operator systematically.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The state is given as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle
\]

The norm of the state is calculated as:

\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right)
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is defined with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x
\]

where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right)
\]

These are also the eigenstates of \( A \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probability of measuring the eigenstate \( |+x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2
\]

The inner product is:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | + \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64
\]

Similarly, the probability of measuring \( |-x\rangle \) is:

\[
P(-x) = |\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2
\]

The inner product is:

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | - \langle \downarrow | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle \right)
\]

The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) in vector form is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \begin{bmatrix} 1+i \\ 2-i \end{bmatrix}
\]

The inner product \( \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) \right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 2 - i - 2i + i^2 = 1 - 3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 2 + 3i + i^2 = 1 + 3i
\]

Adding these gives:

\[
\langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( 1 - 3i + 1 + 3i \right) = \frac{2}{7}
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively. The average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).
