Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read the question again and break it down step by step.

So, the problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of some operator A. The matrix representation of A has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of this operator.

Hmm, first, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional to that combination. So the first step is to find the normalization factor. Let me write down the state:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So I'll compute the inner product.

The inner product is (1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down| multiplied by (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product of |up> and |down> are orthonormal, right? So <up|up> = 1, <down|down> =1, and <up|down> = 0.

So the inner product calculation:

(1+i)(1-i) * <up|up> + (1+i)(-i)(something?) Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Wait, let me write it out. The state is a vector in a 2-dimensional space. So |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i), b=(2-i).

So the inner product <alpha|alpha> = |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Compute |b|^2: (2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 + 2i -2i + (i^2)(-1) wait, let me compute it correctly.

(2 -i)(2 +i) = 2*2 + 2i - 2i - i^2 = 4 +0i - (-1) = 4 +1 =5.

So |a|^2 is 2, |b|^2 is 5. So the total is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Thus, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, no, wait. The state is proportional to that vector, so the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So now, I have the normalized state.

Next, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So in a two-dimensional space, the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because when i≠j, it's ħ/2. So the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are ħ/2, and the diagonals are 0. So A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, sometimes operators are represented with eigenvalues in a different basis. Hmm, but for this problem, the operator's matrix is given as A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, else 0. So A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal.

So the matrix for A is:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0   ]

Wait, but the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, scaled by ħ/2. Because X is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So the eigenstates would be |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. But wait, wait.

Wait, the operator A is equal to (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix σ_x has elements [[0 1],[1 0]], so A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

So when the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A, it's the same as finding the probabilities of collapsing into |+x> and |-x> when measuring A.

So the first task is to express the state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, we can compute the probability by calculating the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

Let me write down the eigenstates of A.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So to find the probability of measuring +x, compute |< +x | alpha >|^2, and similarly for |−x>.

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

First, < +x | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the inner product is:

[ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Which is [ ( (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> ) + ( (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

But <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and <up|down> is 0.

So this simplifies to [ (1+i) *1 + (2 -i) *1 ] / (sqrt(14)).

Wait, no, because the inner product is < +x | alpha > = [ ( (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me redo that.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

But wait, no. Wait, no, the inner product is:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> + ...? No, actually, let's think in terms of components.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write |alpha> in vector form. Let me represent |up> as (1,0) and |down> as (0,1). Then |alpha> is [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

The state |+x> is [1,1]^T / sqrt(2). So the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) (1 * (1+i) + 1 * (2 -i)) ) / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, wait. Because |alpha> is (1+i, 2 -i)/sqrt(7), and |+x> is (1,1)/sqrt(2). So the inner product is the conjugate of |+x> dotted with |alpha>.

Wait, no, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of |+x> multiplied by |alpha>.

Wait, in Dirac notation, < +x | alpha > is equal to the conjugate transpose of | +x > multiplied by | alpha >.

So |+x> is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^T, so its conjugate transpose is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

So the inner product is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ].

Which equals (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7).

Simplify numerator: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

So < +x | alpha > = (3) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )= 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the probability is the square of the absolute value, which is [3^2]/(14) )=9/14 ≈0.642857.

Similarly, the probability for |-x> is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) ?

Wait, no, let's compute < -x | alpha >.

The state |-x> is (1, -1)/sqrt(2). Its conjugate transpose is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

So < -x | alpha > is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)] · [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Which is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

Compute numerator: (1 + i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i = (-1 + 2i).

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait: 5/14 is approximately 0.357, but earlier I had 9/14≈0.642857. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but 9+5=14, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.642857 (for +x) and 0.35714 (for -x).

Looking at the options, let's check:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

So 0.64 is close to 9/14 ≈0.642857, and 0.36 is close to 5/14≈0.35714. So the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha> .

But since A is a Hermitian operator, its average is the expectation value, which can be found by A's eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Wait, but let's compute it.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) < alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

We can compute <sigma_x> = <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So sigma_x |alpha> is [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is the conjugate of the first component multiplied by the first component, plus the conjugate of the second component multiplied by the second component.

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly:

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by sigma_x |alpha> which is [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Which is [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] /7.

Let me compute numerator:

(1-i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So sum is (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

So the average value of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says average is hbar/7. So that matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Which is option A.

But wait, let me check if I did the inner product correctly for the probabilities. Because sometimes I could have messed up the normalization.

Wait, wait, when I computed < +x | alpha >, I got 3/sqrt(14). The absolute square is 9/14, which is about 0.6428.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. So that matches.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined using the condition \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). Calculating \( |1+i|^2 = 2 \) and \( |2-i|^2 = 5 \), the total norm is \( \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) is given with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) for \( i = j \). This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlap \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \) and \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \). Using the inner product:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) / \sqrt{7},
\]

simplifying the numerator gives \( (1+i) + (2-i) = 3 \). Thus:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]

and the probability is \( |\langle +x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64 \).

Similarly, for \( |-x\rangle \):

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) / \sqrt{7},
\]

simplifying the numerator gives \( (1+i) - (2-i) = -1 + 2i \). The probability is:

\[
|\langle -x | \alpha \rangle|^2 = \frac{|-1 + 2i|^2}{14} = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using \( \sigma_x |\alpha\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \\ \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \\ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \end{bmatrix} \), the inner product \( \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 1 - 3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 1 + 3i,
\]

so:

\[
\langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1 - 3i + 1 + 3i}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**

Answer: A
