Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think. Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets.

The setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both have circular orbits. So, I guess the main difference is the Doppler shift detected for each star.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

Wait, the RV method relies on the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift. The formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) ) / ( ( (P) ) * (2π) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version. Since both stars have the same mass (like Sun), and the planets have similar mass (Neptune-like), so M_* >> M_p. So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ). Wait, no, let me get the formula right.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 π c) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ] * [ 1 / (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ]

But since e=0 for circular orbits, and M_* >> M_p, this simplifies.

So K ≈ ( (G * P ) / (2 π c ) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_* )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe rearrange it. Let me see. Let's write it as:

K ∝ (M_p) / (M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, because G is a constant, so if I write K proportional to (M_p / M_*^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me think again. The formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) / ( (P) * (1 - e²) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2 π c) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should look for the dependence of K on P. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Doppler shift being proportional to the velocity semi-amplitude, which is K.

K is the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) / ( (P) * (2 π) )^(1/3) ) ) * 1 / c ?

Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me try to find the relation between K, P, and other variables.

Another approach: The RV method gives K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( ( (2 π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

Since M_* >> M_p, this simplifies to approximately:

K ≈ ( (2 π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's better to set up the proportion.

Given that both stars have same mass (M) and both planets have same mass (m), but K1 and K2 are given.

So the ratio K2 / K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no, let me think again. From the formula, K is proportional to (m / M^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, let's get back. The formula for K is:

K = [ (2 π G ) / (c P) ]^(1/3) * ( m sin i ) / ( (M + m )^(2/3) )

Again, because M >> m, (M + m) ≈ M, so:

K ≈ [ (2 π G ) / (c P) ]^(1/3) * ( m ) / ( M^(2/3) )

So K is proportional to [1 / P^(1/3)] because the other factors are constants for both stars (same M, same m, same i, perhaps? Or at least, the problem says masses are similar, so m is the same for both planets. And M is same for both stars.)

Wait, but actually, in this problem, the Doppler shifts (K) are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Oh wait, no, wait, the shifts are given in milliangstroms. But wait, K is velocity, so the Doppler shift is related to velocity via the formula:

Δλ / λ = v/c

So if the shift is 5 milliangstrom, that's 5e-3 angstrom. The rest wavelength λ is, say, λ0. So Δλ = 5e-3 angstrom.

So v = c * (Δλ / λ0 )

But λ0 is about the same for the same spectral line. So the velocity v is proportional to Δλ. So if K (the semi-amplitude velocity) for planet 1 is 5 miliangstrom, and for planet 2 is 7 miliang, then K2 = (7/5) * K1. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Because the problem says the same wavelength, so same λ0. So the Doppler shift is directly proportional to the velocity. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

But wait, from the formula, K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)).

Wait, so K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So if K2 = (7/5) K1, then (7/5) K1 = K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) * K1 → wait, no, we have to relate K and P.

Wait, let's think in terms of K being proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)).

So K1 = constant * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

K2 = same constant * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

So K2 / K1 = ( (1 / P2^(1/3) ) ) / (1 / P1^(1/3) ) ) = ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

But K2/K1 = 7/5.

So (P1 / P2 )^(1/3) = 7/5.

Then cube both sides: P1 / P2 = (7/5)^3 = 343 / 125 ≈ 2.744.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 ≈ P1 * (125/343) ≈ P1 * 0.364.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1.

Wait, that would be (P2 / P1) = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's shorter, meaning that P2 is about 0.36 times as long. So P2 is shorter, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1, so it's 0.36 times as long.

Wait, the options are given, and one of them is A) ~0.36.

So the answer should be that P2's period is approximately 0.36 times that of P1, meaning it's shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36.

Wait, but the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

If P2 is 0.36×P1, then it's shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the question is about how many times longer, which would be P2 is shorter, so the correct answer is approximately 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps.

1. K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3)).

So K2/K1 = 7/5 = (K2) / (K1) = (P1^(1/3)) / (P2^(1/3)) )

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (343/125) = P1/P2 → P2 = (125/343) P1 → P2 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So it's shorter.

Therefore, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So how many times longer is planet #2 than #1? Answer: it's 0.36 times as long, so the correct option is A) ~0.36.

So the answer should be A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). Since the two stars and planets have similar masses, the proportionality constant is the same for both planets. Let \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) represent the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for Planet #1 and Planet #2, respectively. The ratio of \( K_2 \) to \( K_1 \) is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{P_1^{1/3}}{P_2^{1/3}}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

The problem states that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately \( 0.36 \) times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is \( 0.36 \).
