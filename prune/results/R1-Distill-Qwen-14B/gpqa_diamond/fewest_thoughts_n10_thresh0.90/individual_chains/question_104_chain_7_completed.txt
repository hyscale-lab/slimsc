Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is what's measured. The formula I recall is K = [ (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) ]^(1/3) ) / (c * sqrt(1 + (M_p/M_s)^2)) ), but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, for small masses (since M_p << M_s), it approximates to K ≈ (v) = (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * P ) )^(1/3)? Not sure.

Wait, another approach. The RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula I think is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since e is zero for circular orbits (given), and the problem says the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar mass. M_p << M_s, so M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / M_s )^(1/3) ) * (1) / ( ( P )^(1/3) ) ) * sin i. Since both planets are around stars with similar masses (same as Sun), and sin i is probably similar (assuming same inclination, which the problem doesn't specify, but since it's RV method and it's detected, I think we can assume sin i is the same and maybe 1 for both.

So K is proportional to ( M_p )^(1/3) / ( P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, no, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me think again. Let me recall the correct formula for K.

The velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c³) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) / (1 - e²)^(1/2)

But since e is zero, and M_p << M_s, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p sin i ) / ( M_s * P ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (2π c³) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. I remember that when M_p is much smaller than M_s, the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_s ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

But with e=0, so K ∝ ( M_p )^(1/3) / ( P^(1/3) )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact proportionality. Alternatively, another formula I've come across is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_s + M_p) * (1 - e²) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / ( c * P^(1/3) )

But again, given that M_p is much smaller, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s and sin i is same for both, and e=0, so K ≈ ( (G M_p) / (M_s) )^(1/3) * (1/(c P^(1/3))) )

So K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but wait, maybe I should think about Kepler's third law. Because the actual period P depends on the semi-major axis and the sum of the masses.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ (a³ (M_s + M_p))⁻¹. Wait, the formula is P² = (4π² a³) / ( G (M_s + M_p) )

Since M_p is negligible, P² ≈ (4π² a³) / ( G M_s )

But since the star's velocity is what's measured, and the RV method relates to the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The star's velocity is v = (2π a_s) / P, where a_s is the star's orbit radius (a planet's orbit radius is a_p = a_s * (M_s/(M_p)), approximately, since M_p << M_s. So a_p ≈ (M_s / M_p) a_s. 

So v = 2π a_s / P.

But a_p is related to the planet's orbit. From Kepler's law, a_p³ = G (M_s + M_p) P² / (4π²) ≈ G M_s P²/(4π²)

So a_p ≈ cube root( G M_s P²/(4π²) )

But the star's orbit is a_s = a_p * (M_p / M_s) ≈ a_p * (M_p / M_s)

So a_s ≈ cube_root( G M_s P²/(4π²) ) * (M_p/M_s )

Thus, v = 2 π a_s / P = 2 π / P * cube_root( G M_s P²/(4π²) ) * (M_p/M_s )

Simplify this:

Let me compute the cube_root( G M_s P²/(4π²) ) = [ (G M_s P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

So v = (2 π / P) * [ (G M_s P²) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p / M_s )

Simplify exponents:

(2 π) / P multiplied by [ (G M_s P² )^(1/3) ) ] / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] * (M_p / M_s )

So,

= (2 π) / P * (G M_s P²)^(1/3) / (4 π²)^(1/3) ) * ( M_p / M_s )

Let me write 2 π as 2 π (4 π²)^( -1/3 ) ) * (4 π²)^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to combine exponents.

Let me compute the exponents for each term:

G^(1/3), M_s^(1/3), P^(2/3), 4^(-1/3) π^(-2/3), etc.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

v = (2 π ) / P * [ (G M_s P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3) * (M_p / M_s )

Breaking down the terms:

= (2 π) / P * (G^(1/3) M_s^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3)) )) * (M_p / M_s )

Now, let's collect like terms:

G and M_s and P and M_p.

So, let's write all factors:

= (2 π) / P * G^(1/3) M_s^(1/3) P^(2/3) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3)) ) * (M_p / M_s )

Let me rearrange the terms:

= (2 / 4^(1/3)) ) * ( π / π^(2/3) ) ) * ( G^(1/3) M_s^(1/3) M_p ) / ( M_s ) ) * ( P^(2/3) ) / P )

Simplify each part.

First term: 2 / 4^(1/3) = 2 / (2) ) because 4 is 2², so 4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3). Wait, wait, 4^(1/3) is cube root of 4, which is about 1.5874. Alternatively, 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874. But 2/ (2^(2/3)) )= 2^(1 - 2/3) )= 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.

Wait, perhaps it's better to keep it as exponents.

2 is 2^1, 4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3). So 2 / 4^(1/3) = 2^(1) / 2^(2/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) = 2^(1/3) = cube root of 2.

Similarly, π / π^(2/3) = π^(1 - 2/3) ) = π^(1/3).

So the first part becomes 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3).

Next term: G^(1/3).

M_s terms: M_s^(1/3) in numerator, and M_s in denominator (because M_s is M_s^1). So M_s^(1/3) / M_s^1 = M_s^(-2/3).

M_p is in the numerator as M_p^1.

P terms: P^(2/3) in numerator, P in denominator is P^(1). So P^(2/3 - 1) )= P^(-1/3).

So putting all terms together:

v = (2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) * G^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) * ( M_s^(-2/3) ) * ( P^(-1/3) )

Wait, combining the constants:

2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) is (2 π )^(1/3).

So v = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) * ( M_s^(-2/3) ) * ( P^(-1/3) )

Hmm, perhaps I should write this as:

v ~ ( G M_p )^(1/3) / ( ( M_s^(2) P )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the formula as:

v = [ (G * M_p )/( M_s^2 * P ) ]^(1/3) * ( 2 π )

Wait, I might be getting stuck here. Let me think about the ratio between the two velocities.

Let’s denote:

K1 is the velocity semi-amplitude for planet 1, K2 for planet 2.

We have K1 = 5 miliangstroms and K2=7 miliangstroms.

Wait, but wait, the question says the 'periodic wavelength shift' is in milliangstroms. Wait, but RV is measured as a velocity shift (Doppler shift), which corresponds to a change in wavelength. So the shift of the spectral line is proportional to the velocity. So the velocity is higher when the shift is larger. But wait, the relationship between velocity and wavelength shift is given by the Doppler formula.

The Doppler shift formula is:

Δλ / λ0 = v / c

Where v is the velocity, λ0 is the rest wavelength, and c is speed of light.

So the velocity is v = (Δλ / λ0) * c

But in this question, they give the shift as 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms. But without knowing λ0, we can't compute v numerically. Wait, but the problem only asks about the ratio of the periods, which might not require knowing absolute velocities but the ratio based on the given shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual formula for K relates to the RV method, which is K = (v * sin i) / (c) for some terms? Or perhaps the shift is proportional to the velocity. So, K is proportional to the shift.

Wait, let's think about it. Since the RV method detects the star's velocity, which is K. The shift in wavelength is proportional to K. So if K1 and K2 are the velocities, then the shifts are (K1/c)*λ0 and (K2/c)*λ0. But since λ0 is the same for both (same spectral line), the ratio of the shifts is the same as the ratio of the velocities. So, K2/K1 = (shift2)/(shift1) = 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, that's a big point. Because if the same spectral line is observed, the rest wavelength λ0 is the same for both stars. So the shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity. So shift = K * (λ0 / c). So K1/K2 = shift1 / shift2.

So K2 = (7/5) K1.

Wait, but in reality, the RV method gives us K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So the shift in wavelength is proportional to K. So if K2 is larger, the shift is larger.

So the ratio K2/K1 = 7/5.

Now, from the earlier formula, K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) / (P^(1/3)) ).

Wait, but both planets have the same mass, right? The question says both have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p1 = M_p2.

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Therefore, K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

But we have K2/K1 =7/5.

So,

(7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(7/5)^3 = P1 / P2

=> P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, no:

Wait, (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So, cubing both sides: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

So, how many times longer is P2 than P1?

P2 / P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method measures the Doppler shift of spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity semi-amplitude \( K \). The problem provides the wavelength shifts for both planets, which are proportional to their respective \( K \) values. Thus, the ratio of the shifts directly gives the ratio of \( K_2 \) to \( K_1 \):  
\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{\text{Shift}_2}{\text{Shift}_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

From the RV method, \( K \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the planet's mass \( M_p \) (which is the same for both planets) through the formula:  
\[
K \propto \frac{M_p^{1/3}}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since \( M_p \) is the same for both planets, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \):  
\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{P_1^{1/3}}{P_2^{1/3}}
\]

Rearranging for \( P_2 / P_1 \):  
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_2 / K_1 = 7 / 5 \):  
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. The correct answer is:
