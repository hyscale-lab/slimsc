Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember the Michael reaction involves enolates acting as nucleophiles attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part carefully.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH as the conditions. Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. When deprotonated, it forms an enolate ion. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor here.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the beta carbon, with an ester group on the alpha. When the enolate (from malonate) attacks, it should add to the beta position, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

Looking at the possible products for A, option A says trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Wait, but the product of a Michael addition would be a new ester. Let me see: the enolate of dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(CO2Me)2) would attack the acrylate, so the structure would be the malonate adding to the acrylate's beta carbon.

Wait, wait. The acrylate is CH2=CH-p-tolyl-Ome? Or is it the other way? No, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. Oh wait, no, wait: Acrylate is CH2=CHCO2Me, but in this case, substituted. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me? No, wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure would be (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. But wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The correct structure is probably CH2=CH-p-tolyl with the ester on the end. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. No, the numbering would be such that the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 2, and the ester on carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me? Or maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CO2Me. Hmm, not sure. Wait, (E)-3-(
