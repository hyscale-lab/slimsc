Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my statistical mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Oh wait, no, actually, each state contributes a term exp( -βE ), where E is the energy of that state. So I need to find all possible states, their energies, and sum exp(-βE) for each.

But wait, each spin has two possible states, so the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. That's manageable. Maybe I can list all possible combinations and compute the energy for each.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the energy expression. E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So S1S2 is 1 if they're the same, -1 if different, same for the others.

Wait, J is probably a coupling constant. If J is positive, the energy is minimized when all the spins are aligned (since E would be negative then). If J is negative, maybe antiferromagnetic behavior.

But regardless, the problem asks for the partition function, so I just need to calculate all possible energy values and count their multiplicities.

So each spin is either +1 or -1. Let me represent the state as (S1, S2, S3). So the possible states are all combinations of +1 and -1 for the three spins.

Let me list all 8 states:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I'll compute E. Then, I'll group the states with the same E and sum their contributions to Z.

Let's take each state one by one.

State 1: All spins +1.
S1S2 = 1*1 =1
S1S3=1
S2S3=1
So E = -J [1 +1 +1] = -3J.

State 2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
E= -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum: (-1)+1+(-1)=-1
E= J.

State4: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
Sum: -1-1+1 =-1
E= J.

State5: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1.
S1S2=(-1)*1=-1
S1S3=(-1)*1=-1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum: -1-1+1= -1 → E= J.

State6: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.
S1S2=(-1)(1)=-1
S1S3=(-1)(-1)=1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1 → E= J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.
S1S2=(-1)(-1)=1
S1S3=(-1)(1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)(1)=-1
Sum:1 -1 -1 =-1 → E= J.

State8: All spins -1.
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum 3 → E= -3J.

Wait, no, let me compute that again. For state8, all spins are -1.

S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1
Same for S1S3 and S2S3. So each product is 1. So sum is 3. E= -J*3 = -3J.

So looking back, which states have E=-3J and which have E=J.

States 1 and 8 have E=-3J. The other 6 states have E=J (since states 2-7 all have E=J).

So the partition function Z is sum over all states of exp(-β E).

Each state contributes exp(-β E), so for E=-3J, exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J). There are two such states, so their contribution is 2 * exp(3β J).

For E=J, each of the other 6 states contributes exp(-β J). So 6 * exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 * e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}, which matches. Option A is 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}, which would be if E was opposite in sign.

Wait wait, the energy is E = -J [sum], so when sum is 3, E is -3J. So the exponent is exp(-β E) = exp(3J β). So the calculation is correct.

So I think the correct answer is option B. Let me look at the options.

Option B: Z=2 e^{3 J β} +6 e^{- J β} → yes, that's what I have.

Wait, but wait, in the question statement, the energy is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So when S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is 3 (all same), E is -3J. So for each of these two states, the energy term is -3J. So exp(-β E) would be exp(3J β).

And for the other 6 states, E is J → exp(-β J).

So the partition function is 2 * e^{3 J β} +6 e^{-J β}, which is option B.


The system consists of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). The goal is to compute the partition function \( Z \), which is the sum over all possible states of \( \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/kT \).

### Step 1: Enumerate all possible states
Each spin has two possible states (\( +1 \) or \( -1 \)), so there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. These states are:

1. \( (+1, +1, +1) \)
2. \( (+1, +1, -1) \)
3. \( (+1, -1, +1) \)
4. \( (+1, -1, -1) \)
5. \( (-1, +1, +1) \)
6. \( (-1, +1, -1) \)
7. \( (-1, -1, +1) \)
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \)

### Step 2: Compute the energy for each state
The energy \( E \) is determined by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). For each state, the products \( S_1S_2 \), \( S_1S_3 \), and \( S_2S_3 \) are calculated, summed, and multiplied by \( -J \):

1. \( (+1, +1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1 \), \( S_1S_3 = 1 \), \( S_2S_3 = 1 \). Sum = \( 3 \), \( E = -3J \).
2. \( (+1, +1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1 \), \( S_1S_3 = -1 \), \( S_2S_3 = -1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
3. \( (+1, -1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1 \), \( S_1S_3 = 1 \), \( S_2S_3 = -1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
4. \( (+1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1 \), \( S_1S_3 = -1 \), \( S_2S_3 = 1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
5. \( (-1, +1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1 \), \( S_1S_3 = -1 \), \( S_2S_3 = 1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
6. \( (-1, +1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1 \), \( S_1S_3 = 1 \), \( S_2S_3 = -1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
7. \( (-1, -1, +1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1 \), \( S_1S_3 = -1 \), \( S_2S_3 = -1 \). Sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \).
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1 \), \( S_1S_3 = 1 \), \( S_2S_3 = 1 \). Sum = \( 3 \), \( E = -3J \).

### Step 3: Group states by energy
- States with \( E = -3J \): 2 states (\( (+1, +1, +1) \) and \( (-1, -1, -1) \)).
- States with \( E = J \): 6 states (all others).

### Step 4: Compute the partition function
The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of \( \exp(-\beta E) \) for all states:

\[
Z = 2 \cdot \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \cdot \exp(-J\beta).
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The correct expression matches **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \).

Answer: B
