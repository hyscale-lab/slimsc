Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay happens as X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime is measured in the lab frame, which is longer than the proper lifetime due to time dilation. So the lab lifetime τ is γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution required. I think the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point from the production point. So the particles are moving, and the decay happens after some time, so the distance they travel before decaying is important. The minimum resolution would be the distance that allows us to detect at least 30% of the decays.

Right, so the particles are moving at a velocity v, and the lifetime in the lab frame is longer, so the average distance they travel before decaying is L = v * γ τ₀. But wait, the time we need to consider is the lab frame time, which is τ = γ τ₀. So the decay length is L = v * τ.

Wait, but since the problem is about the minimum resolution, maybe we're looking for the distance such that a certain fraction of particles decay within that distance. So 30% of decays should be within the resolution. Hmm, that would relate to the mean lifetime and the time resolution perhaps. Or maybe it's about the average decay length and the minimum required to capture some fraction.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the time it takes for the particle to decay, and the detector's ability to measure the time difference between production and decay. But I'm not sure. Wait, the resolution probably refers to the spatial resolution, like how precisely the chamber can measure where the decay occurred. So if the particles are moving quickly, they might travel a certain distance before decaying, and the chamber needs to be able to detect that point accurately. So the minimum resolution would be the characteristic decay length that allows capturing 30% of the decays.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the average decay length. The average distance a particle travels before decaying is L = γ c τ₀, because L = v * τ. And v is close to c for high-energy particles, so v≈c. So L ≈ c * γ τ₀.

Wait, but the particle has a certain energy, which would determine γ. The energy E is given as 27 GeV, which is the total energy. The mass m is 3.41 GeV. So the gamma factor is E/m, right? Because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But since the units are in GeV, perhaps we can ignore the c² as it's accounted for in the units.

So γ = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait, the energy is given as 27 GeV, so γ is E/(m c²). But since m is 3.41 GeV/c², E = 27 GeV = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ) → wait, the units might be a bit tricky. But I think in natural units where c=1, the calculation is γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918.

So γ is about 7.918.

Now, the average decay length L is c * τ * γ. Wait, no. Because τ is the proper lifetime, so the lab lifetime is τ_lab = γ τ. So the average distance is L = v τ_lab ≈ c * τ_lab = c γ τ₀.

So L = c γ τ₀.

But we have to compute that. Let me plug in the numbers.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

γ is approximately 7.918.

τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 7.918 * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, multiply 3e8 by 7.918: 3e8 * 7.918 ≈ 2.3754e9.

Then multiply by 8e-16: 2.3754e9 * 8e-16 = (2.3754 * 8) * 1e-7 = 19.0032e-7 m. Which is 1.90032e-6 meters.

Wait, that's about 1.9e-6 meters. Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close. Hmm. So why is it not matching exactly?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 3e8 is 3 * 1e8. Multiply by 7.918: 3 *7.918 is approximately 23.754, so 23.754e8. Then multiply by 8e-16: 23.754e8 *8e-16 = 23.754 *8 * 1e-8 = 190.032 *1e-8 = 1.90032e-6 meters. So about 1.9e-6 m.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Oh wait, let me recalculate with more precise numbers.

Wait, E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is exactly 27 / 3.41.

Let me compute 27 / 3.41:

3.41 goes into 27 about 7.918 times as before.

Wait, 3.41 *7 = 23.87, 3.41*7.9= 3.41*(7 +0.9) = 23.87 + 3.069 = 26.939. So 3.41*7.918 ≈ 27 GeV. So gamma is approximately 7.918.

So perhaps I didn't make a mistake in gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute c * gamma * tau0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

gamma is 7.918.

tau0 is 8e-16 s.

So 3e8 * 7.918 = 3e8 *7=2.1e9, 3e8 *0.918=2.754e8. So 2.1e9 +2.754e8=2.3754e9.

Then, 2.3754e9 *8e-16 = (2.3754 *8) * 1e-7. 2.3754*8 is about 19.0032.

So 19.0032e-7 m = 1.90032e-6 meters, which is 1.90032e-6 m.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance that captures 30% of the decays, which is a shorter length than the mean.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The average decay length is L_avg = c * gamma * tau0. But 30% is less than the average. So perhaps we're looking for the distance where the probability of decaying within that length is 30%. Hmm, that's a different approach.

The decay follows an exponential distribution, so the probability P that a particle decays within a distance L is P = 1 - e^(-L/(c gamma tau0)).

We need P >= 0.30. So 1 - e^(-L/(c gamma tau0)) >= 0.3 → e^(-L/(c gamma tau0)) <= 0.7 → - L/(c gamma tau0) <= ln(0.7) → L >= ( - ln(0.7) ) * c gamma tau0.

Wait, because we need L to be larger than a certain value to have at least 30% decay.

Wait, let me compute ln(0.7). Let me approximate ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667.

So L >= 0.35667 * c gamma tau0.

So plugging in the numbers:

gamma is 7.918, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

c gamma tau0 is 3e8 *7.918 *8e-16 = which we computed earlier as about 1.90032e-6 m.

So 0.35667 * 1.90032e-6 ≈ 0.35667 * 1.9e-6.

Calculating 0.35 *1.9e-6 = 0.665e-6 m, and 0.00667*1.9e-6≈0.012673e-6. Adding them gives 0.665e-6 +0.012673e-6 ≈ 0.6777e-6 m, approximately 6.777e-7 m.

Wait, that's way smaller than the options. So perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution, which is the distance that allows 30% of decays to be observed. So the average decay length is around 1.9e-6 m, but to observe at least 30%, maybe the minimum is the length that captures a certain fraction. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, the proper lifetime is tau0. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma*tau0. The time it takes for a particle moving at speed v to decay is t = gamma tau0. The distance is L = v t. But wait, v is approximately c, so L ≈ c gamma tau0, which is the average decay length.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution refers to the ability to measure the decay point with a certain precision. So the chamber must be able to resolve structures on the order of the decay length to capture
