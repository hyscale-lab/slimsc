Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. Because only one hemisphere has spots, when we observe the star's brightness over time (photometric time series), we'll see periodic dips as the star rotates and the spots come into and out of view. The question says this situation can resemble an exoplanet causing brightness variations. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve. So, we need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots with the variation caused by a planet. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star.

Wait, but in this case, it's not a planet causing the dip; it's the spots. But the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet, so perhaps the star's brightness variation due to the spots is being mistaken for a planet's transit. Alternatively, the question is comparing the two scenarios and asking what planet size would cause the same dip as the spots do.

So first, I think I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, equate that to the variation a planet would cause and find the planet's radius.

Let me break it down. The star's radius is Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, so the filling factor is 0.2. But wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots compared to the hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar².

Wait, wait. No, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So if the entire hemisphere is a circle with area (π Rstar²)/2, and 20% of that is spots, then the area of the spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar².

But each spot is cooler. So when the star rotates and the spot comes into view, the total brightness of the star changes because a cooler area is now contributing less light.

Wait, the star's total brightness is the sum of the light from all its surface areas. So normally, the star emits with a certain flux. When a spot is visible, the flux is slightly less because that area is emitting less.

The flux from the star without spots is L = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. But when a spot is present, part of the surface is at a lower temperature. So the observed flux is L_obs = L * (1 - (ΔL/L)), where ΔL is the change due to the spots.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible. So the change in flux is the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when spots are visible.

The star's total flux without spots is L0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. When spots are present, the flux is L = L0 - (number of spots * area of each spot * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4) + ... wait, perhaps I should model it differently.

Wait, each spot has an area of A_spot, and a temperature of Teff - 1000 K. So the flux from each spot is A_spot * σ (Teff_spot)^4, where Teff_spot = Teff - 1000 = 5000 K.

But the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar².

Wait, but when the star rotates, only part of the spots come into view. Wait no, the problem says that only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the star rotates, we see either the spotted hemisphere or the non-spotted one, but perhaps more accurately, the spots are on one side, so when that side is facing us, the brightness drops, and when the other side (non-spotty) comes into view, the brightness returns to normal.

Wait, no, the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So as the star spins, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. So the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted is facing.

Wait, no, the maximum brightness would be when the cooler spots are not visible, i.e., when the unspotted hemisphere is the one we see. Wait, actually, the star emits more light when we see the hotter regions. So when the spotted side is facing us, the brightness is lower because the spots are cooler. When the other side (which is entirely normal) is facing, the brightness is higher.

Wait, no, wait. The star's entire surface isn't at the same temperature. The spots are cooler. So when the spotted side is facing us, the flux is less because part of the surface is emitting less.

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the flux from the unspotted hemisphere plus the flux from the spotted.

The unspotted hemisphere has area (π Rstar²)/2, and emits at Teff = 6000 K.

The spotted hemisphere has area (π Rstar²)/2, but 20% of that (0.2 * (π Rstar²)/2 ) is covered by spots at 5000 K, and the rest (80%) is normal.

Wait, actually, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the spotted area per hemisphere is 0.2*(π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

Flux_unspotted_side = (area of unspotted hemisphere) * σ Teff^4

Wait no, each point on the star emits flux σ Teff^4. So the total flux is the sum over all areas.

Wait, let me think differently. The entire star's flux is the sum of all the small areas. When a spot is present, part of the surface is at a lower temperature.

So when the star is viewed from Earth, the flux we get is the sum of the flux from the visible surface.

So, when the star is not rotating, the total flux is the sum of all areas. When a spot comes into view, part of the flux is reduced.

But wait, the star is rotating, so the spots on the hemisphere will come into view at certain times. So the maximum and minimum brightness can be calculated based on when the spots are visible.

Wait, perhaps to find the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots, I can compute the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, then find the relative change.

So the maximum flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the spotted one is not. The minimum occurs when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, when we see one hemisphere, the other is on the far side. So when the spotted hemisphere is the one facing us, the flux is lower. When the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing, the flux is higher.

So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So first, compute the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. Then when the spotted hemisphere is visible, compute that flux.

Compute the difference between the two. The amplitude is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Wait, but actually, the star's total flux is continuous, so when the star rotates, the fraction of the spotted area that is visible varies, but in this case, the entire spotted hemisphere is visible when that side faces us.

Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible, and when the other hemisphere is facing, none are visible.

Wait, that makes sense. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

So, let's compute the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

The unspotted hemisphere contributes flux as if all its area is at 6000K. The area is (π Rstar²)/2.

Flux_unspotted = (π Rstar² / 2) * σ * (6000)^4.

The other hemisphere, which is the spotted one, when it's facing us, contributes less flux.

The spotted hemisphere has a filling factor of 0.2. So 20% of its area is at 5000 K, and 80% is at 6000 K.

So the flux from the spotted hemisphere is:

Flux_spotted_part = (0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2)) * σ (5000)^4 + (0.8 * (π Rstar² / 2)) * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all of it. So the flux would be the sum of the unspotted part and the spotted part.

Wait, no. Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is visible, but 20% of it is spots at 5000 K, and 80% is normal at 6000 K.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible (F_min) is:

F_min = (0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2)) * σ (5000)^4 + (0.8 * (π Rstar² / 2)) * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but what about when the unspotted hemisphere is facing? Then the spotted hemisphere is on the far side and not visible. So F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. So F_max is the flux from the unspotted hemisphere, which is 100% of that area at 6000 K.

So F_max = (π Rstar² / 2) * σ (6000)^4.

So the relative flux difference is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Wait, but wait, actually, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing, the entire hemisphere is at 6000 K. But when the spotted hemisphere is facing, 20% of it is cooler. So let me compute both F_max and F_min.

Compute F_max:

F_max = (π Rstar² /2 ) * σ (6000)^4.

Compute F_min:

F_min = (0.8 * (π Rstar²/2) * σ (6000)^4 ) + (0.2 * (π Rstar²/2) * σ (5000)^4 )

Because 80% of the hemisphere is at 6000 K, and 20% at 5000 K.

So the difference between F_max and F_min is:

F_max - F_min = [ (π Rstar² / 2) σ 6000^4 ] - [ 0.8 (π Rstar²/2 σ 6000^4) + 0.2 (π Rstar²/2 σ 5000^4) ) ]

= (π Rstar² / 2 σ) [ 6000^4 - (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) ]

= (π Rstar² / 2 σ) [ 6000^4 (1 - 0.8) - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= (π Rstar² / 2 σ) [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 (π Rstar² / 2 σ) [6000^4 - 5000^4 ]

Factor out the 0.2.

So the amplitude (delta F) is F_max - F_min = 0.2 (π Rstar²/2 σ) (6000^4 -5000^4 )

But the total flux when the star is unspotted (F0) would be when the entire star is at 6000 K. Wait, but actually, the star has spots on one hemisphere, so the average flux would be the average between F_max and F_min.

Wait no, because when the star is rotating, we spend 50% of the time seeing F_max and 50% seeing F_min. So the average flux is (F_max + F_min)/2.

But perhaps the key is the amplitude of the brightness variation, which is (F_max - F_min) / F_avg.

Wait, but the problem says that the variation in brightness due to the spots is similar to that of an exoplanet. So we need to find the planet's radius Rpl such that the dip caused by the planet (which is when it blocks part of the star's light) has the same amplitude as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, when the planet transits the star, it blocks a part of the star's surface. The dip in brightness is the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star. Because the planet is much smaller than the star, the temperature of the star's surface isn't a factor here—it's just the geometric area.

So the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl / Rstar)^2, because the area is π Rpl² / π Rstar² = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but wait, the dip is the area of the planet's disk relative to the star's area, which is (Rpl/(Rstar))^2.

So the amplitude (delta F_planet) is (Rpl/(Rstar))^2 * F0, where F0 is the total flux when the star is unobstructed.

Wait, but in this problem, the star's flux isn't uniform. The star's total flux without any spots is if the entire star is at 6000 K. But in reality, one hemisphere is at 6000 K except for 20% of that hemisphere, which is at 5000 K.

So the star's actual average flux (F_avg) is when both hemispheres are considered. Wait, but when the star rotates, we see either hemisphere, so the average flux would be the average of F_max and F_min.

Wait, no. Because when the star is rotating, we spend 50% of the time seeing F_max (unspotted hemisphere) and 50% seeing F_min (spotted hemisphere). So the average flux is (F_max + F_min)/2.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is (F_max - F_min) / F_avg.

Wait, no, the amplitude would be the peak-to-peak variation divided by the average. Or perhaps the maximum dip relative to the average.

Wait, let me clarify. The brightness variation is F_max when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F_min when the spotted is visible. The average brightness is (F_max + F_min)/2. So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/2, but that's the peak-to-peak variation. Alternatively, the maximum change is from F_min to F_max, which is (F_max - F_min).

Wait, but when considering the light curve, the amplitude is the maximum change in brightness relative to the average. So the dip would be (F_avg - F_min) and the rise would be (F_max - F_avg). But since F_max is higher than F_avg, the peak-to-peak amplitude is (F_max - F_avg) + (F_avg - F_min) ) = F_max - F_min.

But perhaps the amplitude is the difference between F_max and F_min, divided by F_avg.

Wait, but the exoplanet's transit causes a dip equal to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0, where F0 is the star's flux without any planet. But in the case of the star with spots, the average flux is not the same as F0. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation due to the spots is (F_max - F_min), and the planet's dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0. The problem states that these two signals should have the same amplitude, so (F_max - F_min) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0.

But wait, no. The problem says that if the star was not covered by spots, the same amplitude would be produced by a planet. So the brightness variation caused by the spots is equivalent to the variation caused by a planet's transit. So the dip from the planet would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0, which should equal the dip from the spots, which is (F_max - F_min).

So, setting (F_max - F_min) = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0.

But wait, F0 in this context would be the star's total flux without any spots. But in reality, the star does have spots, so its total flux is lower than F0. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in brightness due to the spots, compare it to the fractional change due to the planet, and set them equal.

The fractional change due to the spots is (F_max - F_min) / F_avg.

The fractional change due to the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So perhaps equate (F_max - F_min)/F_avg = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps the dip is (F_max - F_min) / F_avg. Let me think.

Wait, the star's average brightness is F_avg = (F_max + F_min)/2.

The dip when the spot is visible is (F_avg - F_min) relative to F_avg.

Similarly, the rise when the spot is not visible is (F_max - F_avg).

But the amplitude of the variation is the peak-to-peak variation divided by something. I think the standard approach is to compute the relative change from the average. So the amplitude would be (F_max - F_avg) which is the same as (F_avg - F_min), whichever way you look at it.

So, the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/2, but perhaps in terms of relative change, it's (F_max - F_min) / F_avg.

Wait, let me compute F_avg.

F_avg = (F_max + F_min) / 2.

So F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible: F_max = (π Rstar² / 2) σ (6000)^4.

F_min is when the spotted hemisphere is visible: F_min = [ 0.8 (π Rstar²/2) σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 (π Rstar²/2) σ (5000)^4 ]

So F_avg = (F_max + F_min) / 2.

Compute (F_max - F_min):

F_max = (π Rstar² σ /2 ) (6000)^4.

F_min = (π Rstar² σ / 2) [ 0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ]

So F_max - F_min = (π Rstar² σ /2 ) (6000^4 - [0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 ])

= (π Rstar² σ /2 ) [ (1 - 0.8)*6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= (π Rstar² σ / 2 ) [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 (π Rstar² σ / 2 ) (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Now, the amplitude (relative to the average) would be (F_max - F_min) / F_avg.

Wait, let's compute F_avg.

F_avg = (F_max + F_min)/2.

F_max = A * B where A = (π Rstar² σ /2 ), B = 6000^4.

F_min = A * [0.8 B + 0.2 (5000^4) ]

So F_avg = [ A B + A (0.8 B + 0.2 C ) ] / 2, where C=5000^4.

= A [ B + 0.8 B + 0.2 C ] / 2

= A [ 1.8 B + 0.2 C ] / 2

= (A/2) (1.8 B + 0.2 C )

So, the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) / F_avg.

We have:

(F_max - F_min) = 0.2 A (B - C )

F_avg = (A/2)(1.8 B + 0.2 C )

So,

Amplitude = [ 0.2 A (B - C) ] / [ (A/2)(1.8 B + 0.2 C) ) ]

Simplify:

= [0.2 (B - C ) ] / [ (1.8 B + 0.2 C ) * (1/2) ) ]

= [0.4 (B - C) ] / (1.8 B + 0.2 C )

Hmm, but wait, B is (6000)^4, and C is (5000)^4.

Compute B and C:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So B = 1.296e15, C = 6.25e14.

Compute numerator: B - C = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15.

Denominator: 1.8 B + 0.2 C = 1.8*(1.296e15) + 0.2*(6.25e14)

Compute 1.8 * 1.296e15 = 2.3328e15.

0.2 *6.25e14 = 1.25e14.

So denominator = 2.3328e15 + 0.125e15 = 2.4578e15.

So amplitude = [0.4 * 0.671e15 ] / (2.4578e15 )

= 0.4 * 0.671 / 2.4578

Compute 0.4 *0.671 = 0.2684.

0.2684 / 2.4578 ≈ 0.1091.

So the amplitude is approximately 0.1091, or about 10.9% fractional change.

Wait, but the exoplanet's amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So setting (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1091.

Taking the square root: Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1091) ≈ 0.3303.

Wait, 0.33 is approximately 0.33, but let's check the options.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, 0.33 is closest to option D) 0.32.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I might have made a mistake in computing the amplitude.

Because in reality, the star's brightness variation due to the spots is (F_max - F_min) / F_avg.

Wait, let's recalculate the amplitude correctly.

Wait, F_avg is (F_max + F_min)/2. So the dip is F_avg - F_min.

So the dip is (F_avg - F_min) / F_avg = (F_max + F_min)/2 - F_min ) / ( (F_max + F_min)/2 )

= (F_max - F_min)/2 ) / ( (F_max + F_min)/2 )

= (F_max - F_min)/(F_max + F_min)

Hmm, that's a different approach. Let me compute that.

(F_max - F_min)/(F_max + F_min) = [0.2 A (B - C)] / [ A (1.8 B + 0.2 C) ) ]

= [0.2 (B - C)] / (1.8 B + 0.2 C )

Which is the same as before, which was 0.1091.

Wait, no, because earlier I had:

(F_max - F_min) / F_avg = [0.2 A (B - C)] / [ (A/2)(1.8 B + 0.2 C) ) ]

Which simplified to 0.4 (B - C) / (1.8 B + 0.2 C ), which was approximately 0.1091.

But if the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, that would be the fractional change in brightness.

So, if the planet's transit causes a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which is the fractional change, then we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1091.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1091) ≈ 0.3303.

Which is approximately 0.33.

Looking at the options, D is 0.32, which is close.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of B and C. Let me double-check.

B: 6000^4 = 6^4 * 1e12.

6^4 is 1296, so 1.296e15.

C:5000^4 =5^4 * 1e12 = 625e12=6.25e14.

So, B=1.296e15, C=6.25e14.

So B - C = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15.

Denominator:1.8 B + 0.2 C = 1.8 *1.296e15 + 0.2 *6.25e14.

1.8 *1.296e15 = 2.3328e15.

0.2 *6.25e14=1.25e14=0.125e15.

Sum: 2.3328e15 + 0.125e15=2.4578e15.

So (B - C)=0.671e15.

So 0.4*(B-C)/(1.8B + 0.2C ) = 0.4 * 0.671e15 / 2.4578e15.

Wait, no, wait. The expression is 0.4*(B-C) divided by (1.8B + 0.2C).

Which is 0.4 *0.671e15 / 2.4578e15.

Wait, 0.4 * 0.671 = 0.2684.

0.2684 / 2.4578 ≈ 0.1091.

So yes, ~0.1091.

So (Rpl/Rstar)^2=0.1091 → Rpl/Rstar≈0.330.

Which is approximately 0.33. Looking at the options, option D is 0.32. Close enough.

Wait, but why is option C 0.11? Because 0.33 squared is approximately 0.1089, which is ~0.11. So if the question is asking for the fractional amplitude, which is 0.1091, then Rpl/Rstar is sqrt(0.1091)=0.33.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.33. Option D is 0.32, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0, where F0 is the star's flux without any spots. But the star's flux with spots is F_avg. So the dip from the planet would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0, and the dip from the spots is F_max - F_min.

So if these amplitudes are the same,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0 = F_max - F_min.

Wait, F0 is the flux without any spots, which is when the entire star is at 6000 K.

So F0 = 4π Rstar² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because F0 would be the flux when the entire star is at 6000 K. But in reality, the star's flux is F_avg = (F_max + F_min)/2, which is lower than F0 because of the spots.

Wait, but perhaps the question is saying that if the star didn't have spots, the same amplitude would be caused by a planet. So in that case, the star's flux in the absence of spots would be F0 = 4π Rstar² σ (6000)^4.

But when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star, causing a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0.

On the other hand, with the spots, the dip is F_max - F_min.

So set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0 = F_max - F_min.

But F0 is the total flux when the star is unspotted.

Wait, no, F0 would be the flux without any spots. So F0 = (4π Rstar² σ) (6000)^4.

But F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible: F_max = (π Rstar²/2) σ (6000)^4.

But wait, in reality, the star has spots, so the entire star's flux is F_avg = (F_max + F_min)/2.

But I'm getting myself confused. Let me try an alternative approach.

The key is to compute the fractional change in brightness for both scenarios and set them equal.

For the star with spots, the fractional change is (F_max - F_min) / (F_avg).

Wait, no. The fractional change when the spots are visible is (F_avg - F_min) / F_avg = (F_max - F_min) / (2 F_avg) * 2? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the peak-to-peak variation.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) / F_avg, which is the peak-to-peak divided by the average.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the initial approach, which gave Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.33, which is close to option D, which is 0.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the dip caused by the planet as (Rpl/Rstar)^2, and the dip caused by the spots is (F_max - F_min)/F0, where F0 is the total flux without any spots.

Wait, let me clarify.

Without spots, the star's flux is F0 = 4π Rstar² σ (6000)^4.

With spots, the star's average flux is F_avg = (F_max + F_min)/2.

The dip when spots are visible (F_min) is F_avg - F_min.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) / F0.

So:

(F_max - F_min) = (Rpl^2 / Rstar^2) * F0

So (F_max - F_min) / F0 = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = (F_max - F_min) / F0.

Compute F_max - F_min:

Earlier, F_max - F_min = 0.2 A (B - C ), where A= (π Rstar² σ /2 ), B=6e3^4, C=5e3^4.

F0 =4 π Rstar² σ (6e3)^4.

So,

(F_max - F_min) = 0.2 * (π Rstar² σ / 2) (B - C )

= 0.1 π Rstar² σ (B - C )

F0 =4 π Rstar² σ B.

So,

(F_max - F_min)/F0 = [0.1 π R² σ (B - C) ] / [4 π R² σ B ].

Simplify:

= [0.1 (B - C) ] / (4 B )

= (0.1 (B - C )) / (4 B )

= ( (B - C) ) / (40 B )

= (1 - (C/B )) / 40.

Compute C/B: (5e3/6e3)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

(1 - 0.482253 ) /40 ≈ (0.517747)/40 ≈ 0.0129437.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.0129437 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0129437 ) ≈ 0.1137.

So approximately 0.114, which is about 0.11, which is option C.

Wait, that's different from the earlier approach. So which is correct?

Hmm, I think I might have confused the fluxes. Let me try again.

If the star has spots, when we look at the unspotted side, the flux is F_max = (π Rstar²/2) σ (6000)^4.

When looking at the spotted side, the flux is F_min = [0.8*(π Rstar²/2) σ (6000)^4 ] + [0.2*(π Rstar²/2) σ (5000)^4 ].

So F_max - F_min is the dip when the spots are visible.

In the case without spots, the star's flux is F0 =4 π Rstar² σ (6000)^4.

The dip from the planet would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0.

So, to equate the two dips:

F_max - F_min = (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0.

So,

(F_max - F_min) / F0 = (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Compute F_max - F_min:

F_max = (π R² σ / 2) * 6000^4.

F_min = (π R² σ /2 ) [0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ]

So,

F_max - F_min = (π R² σ /2 ) [6000^4 - (0.8*6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) ]

= (π R² σ /2 ) [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 (π R² σ /2 ) (6000^4 -5000^4 )

= 0.1 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So,

(F_max - F_min ) = 0.1 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

F0 =4 π R² σ 6000^4.

So,

(F_max - F_min )/F0 = [ 0.1 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 π R² σ 6000^4 ]

Simplify terms:

= [0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

= [0.1 ( (6000/5000)^4 *5000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4*(6000^4 ) ]

= [0.1 *5000^4 ( (6/5)^4 -1 ) ] / [4 *6000^4 ]

= [0.1 * (5^4 *1e12) ( (6/5)^4 -1 ) ] / [4*(6^4 *1e12 ) ]

Wait, better to compute numerically.

Compute 6000^4 = 1.296e16? Wait no, 6000^4 = 6e3^4 = 1.296e16? Wait, 6000 is 6e3, so 6^4 is 1296, so 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5000^4 =5^4 *1e12= 625e12=6.25e14.

So,

(6000^4 -5000^4 )=1.296e15 -6.25e14=0.671e15=6.71e14.

So,

(F_max - F_min ) =0.1 π R² σ *6.71e14.

F0=4 π R² σ *1.296e15.

So,

(F_max - F_min)/F0 = [0.1 *6.71e14 ] / [4 *1.296e15 ]

Compute numerator: 0.1 *6.71e14 =6.71e13.

Denominator:4 *1.296e15=5.184e15.

So,

=6.71e13 /5.184e15 ≈ 6.71 /5184 ≈ 0.001294.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 =0.001294 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.001294 ) ≈ 0.03598.

Wait, that's about 0.036, which is approximately 0.04. None of the options are near that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute. I think I messed up the calculation of (F_max - F_min).

Wait, F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible: (π R²/2 ) *6000^4.

F_min is when the spotted hemisphere is visible: (0.8 * π R²/2 *6000^4 ) + (0.2 * π R²/2 *5000^4 )

So F_max - F_min = (π R²/2 *6000^4 ) - [ 0.8*(π R²/2 *6000^4 ) + 0.2*(π R²/2 *5000^4 ) ]

= (π R²/2 ) [6000^4 - 0.8*6000^4 -0.2*5000^4 ]

= (π R²/2 ) [ (1-0.8) *6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 ]

= (π R²/2 ) [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 (π R²/2 ) [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

=0.1 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Ah, earlier I had 0.1 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ), but I think the units were already accounted for.

So,

(F_max - F_min )= 0.1 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

F0 =4 π R² (6000^4 )

So,

(F_max - F_min ) / F0 = [0.1 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / (4 *6000^4 )

= 0.1 (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) /4

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

=0.1 (1 - 0.482253 ) /4 ≈ 0.1 *0.517747 /4 ≈ 0.0517747 /4 ≈ 0.0129437.

So,

(Rpl/Rstar )^2 =0.0129437 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0129437 ) ≈ 0.1137.

Which is approximately 0.114, so option C is 0.11.

Wait, but earlier when I tried a different approach I got ~0.33. But this seems more accurate because I'm comparing the dip caused by the spots to the dip caused by the planet, using the star's total flux without spots as the baseline.

So, the correct approach is to set (F_max - F_min) equal to the planet's dip, which is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 * F0.

Thus, Rpl/Rstar ≈0.114, which is closest to option C, 0.11.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we compare the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots to the fractional change caused by the planet's transit.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Star Properties**:  
   - The star has a radius \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) and an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20% (\( 0.2 \)), and the spots are cooler by \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), i.e., \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   - The total flux from the star without spots is \( F_0 = 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).  
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The flux from the spotted hemisphere is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{min}} = 0.8 \cdot \left( \frac{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{2} \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \right) + 0.2 \cdot \left( \frac{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{2} \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right).
     \]
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{max}} = \frac{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{2} \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4.
     \]
   - The dip in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}} = \frac{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{2} \sigma \left[ 0.2 T_{\text{eff}}^4 - 0.2 T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right].
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), we compute:  
     \[
     F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}} = 0.1 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( 6000^4 - 5000^4 \right).
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation Due to a Planet**:  
   - A planet transiting the star blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the planet's area relative to the star's area. The dip in brightness is:  
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 F_0.
     \]

4. **Equating the Two Signals**:  
   - To produce the same amplitude in the light curve, set \( F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}} = \Delta F_{\text{planet}} \):  
     \[
     0.1 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( 6000^4 - 5000^4 \right) = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \cdot 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma 6000^4.
     \]
   - Simplify to solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{0.1 \left( 6000^4 - 5000^4 \right)}{4 \cdot 6000^4}.
     \]
   - Compute \( 6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \) and \( 5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \):  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{0.1 \cdot (1.296 \times 10^{15} - 6.25 \times 10^{14})}{4 \cdot 1.296 \times 10^{15}}.
     \]
   - Simplify further:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{0.1 \cdot 6.71 \times 10^{14}}{5.184 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.01294.
     \]
   - Taking the square root:  
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.01294} \approx 0.1137.
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.114 \), which is closest to option **C) ~0.11**.
