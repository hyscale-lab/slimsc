Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? And N is the normalization constant, which they've provided as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha squared)). 

The problem asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's definitely non-Gaussian.

The relative entropy here is a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is. But I'm not exactly sure how to compute it. Let me recall. The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But wait, the problem states del_b as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is different. Oh, so it's the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau. Because trace(tau ln tau) is the von Neumann entropy of the Gaussian state, and trace(rho ln rho) is that of the non-Gaussian state. So del_b is the difference in their entropies.

Wait no, wait. Von Neumann entropy is S = - trace(rho ln rho). But in the formula given, del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that would be [ -S(rho) + S(tau) ]. So del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). Because if S(rho) is - trace(rho ln rho), then trace(rho ln rho) is - S(rho). So the given del_b is [ - S(rho) + S(tau) ] which is S(tau) - S(rho).

But wait, relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(rho relative to tau), which involves rho ln rho and rho ln tau. But this is a different measure here, comparing the entropy difference between the Gaussian and non-Gaussian states.

Hmm. So to compute nG, which is this del_b, I need to compute S(tau) and S(rho), subtract them as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Wait no, wait. Let me get this straight. The problem says: del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that's [trace(rho ln rho)] minus [trace(tau ln tau)], which is [ -S(rho) ] - [ -S(tau) ] = S(tau) - S(rho). So del_b is S(tau) minus S(rho). So the non-Gaussianity is this difference.

So, the non-Gaussian state's entropy is S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho), and the Gaussian state's entropy is S(tau) = - trace(tau ln tau). So del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). But wait, that would mean that if the non-Gaussian state is more mixed (higher entropy) than the Gaussian state, del_b would be negative. But I'm not sure about that, because the cat state is a pure state, right? Because it's a superposition of coherent states, which are themselves pure, but the superposition is also pure.

Wait, coherent states are pure, and their superpositions are also pure. So |psi> is a pure state. So rho would be a pure state, so S(rho) would be zero. But tau is a Gaussian state; if it's a thermal state, maybe it's mixed. Wait no, in the context of quantum optics, Gaussian states include pure states like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. So if tau is a coherent state, then it's pure and S(tau) would be zero. Hmm, but the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho, or maybe it's the state that rho is being compared to.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the maximally mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe tau is the state that rho would approach as it becomes Gaussian. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The relative entropy in this problem is used to quantify non-Gaussianity. So if the state is Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity would be zero. So if the state is a perfect Gaussian, then del_b should be zero. So looking at the options, option D is 0. So if the state is a Gaussian state, the answer would be D. 

But our state is a Schrödinger cat, which is non-Gaussian, so the del_b must be non-zero. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different definition, and del_b is the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state tau. Or perhaps tau is the maximally mixed Gaussian state.

Wait, I might be confusing the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity with other measures. Let me think again. The problem says that the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So it's the difference in the von Neumann entropies. So if rho is the non-Gaussian state and tau is a Gaussian state, then del_b would be (S(rho) - S(tau))? Wait no, because S is negative. So [trace(rho ln rho)] is - S(rho), and [trace(tau ln tau)] is - S(tau). So del_b is [ - S(rho) ] - [ - S(tau) ] = S(tau) - S(rho). So if the non-Gaussian state has lower entropy (more pure) than the Gaussian state, then del_b is positive.

But wait, if rho is a pure state, S(rho) is zero. Then del_b = S(tau). But what if tau is a mixed Gaussian state? Then S(tau) would be positive, so del_b would be positive. So the non-Gaussianity is higher when the reference Gaussian state has higher entropy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is not arbitrary. Maybe it's the closest Gaussian state to rho. Because in some non-Gaussianity measures, you compare the state to the nearest Gaussian state.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on how to compute this. Let's try to proceed step by step.

First, I need to compute the density matrix rho for the given state. The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. 

Given phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Let's compute N first. N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Compute sin(2phi): phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp( -2*(0.5)^2 )) = sqrt( 1 - exp( -0.5 ) )

Compute exp(-0.5): that's approximately 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 is about 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is normalized, so rho is |psi><psi|.

So rho = (1/N^2) [ cos(phi)|alpha><alpha| + sin(phi)|-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ) ]

Wait, but |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. The density matrix for a coherent state is a pure state, so it's |alpha><alpha|.

But when you take a superposition of two coherent states, the resulting rho is a mixed state if the two states are orthogonal. Wait, are |alpha> and |-alpha> orthogonal? Let me think. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator a. For |alpha> and |beta>, the inner product is exp( -|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha* beta ). So |alpha> and |-alpha> have inner product exp( -|alpha|^2 - | - alpha|^2 /2 + alpha*(-alpha) ). Wait, wait, let's compute it properly.

<alpha | -alpha> = exp( -|alpha|^2/2 - | - alpha|^2/2 + alpha* (-alpha) ) ) * e^{- |alpha + (-alpha)|^2 / 2} ? Wait, maybe it's better to compute it as:

The inner product <alpha | beta> is e^{-(|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + alpha^* beta}.

So for beta = -alpha, it's e^{ -( |alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2 ) /2 + alpha^* (-alpha) }

= e^{ - alpha^2 - ( - |alpha|^2 ) }

Wait, hold on, |alpha|^2 is alpha* alpha. So alpha is 0.5, so alpha^2 is 0.25. So |alpha|^2 = 0.25.

So:

exp( - (0.25 + 0.25)/2 + (0.5)(-0.5) )

Wait, wait, alpha is 0.5. So alpha is a real number here, so alpha* is 0.5, and beta is -0.5.

So:

<alpha | beta> = exp( -( |0.5|^2 + | -0.5 |^2 ) / 2 + (0.5)(-0.5) )

= exp( -(0.25 + 0.25)/2 + (-0.25) )

= exp( -(0.5)/2 - 0.25 )

= exp( -0.25 - 0.25 )

= exp( -0.5 )

≈ 0.6065.

So <alpha | -alpha> is about 0.6065, so they are not orthogonal.

Thus, the state |psi> is a pure state, because it's a normalized superposition of two coherent states, which themselves are not orthogonal.

But wait, |psi> is a normalized state. So rho is a pure state, so its von Neumann entropy S(rho) is zero.

Wait, is that right? Because if rho is a pure state, S(rho) = - tr(rho ln rho) = 0. So del_b in this case is [0 - trace(tau ln tau)]? Or wait, no, the formula is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Hmm, so trace(rho ln rho) is zero because rho is pure. So del_b = 0 - trace(tau ln tau) = - trace(tau ln tau). But the von Neumann entropy of tau is S(tau) = - trace(tau ln tau). So del_b = - S(tau). But that would make del_b negative.

But non-Gaussianity is a positive quantity, so perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Because if the state is non-Gaussian, del_b should be positive. Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the formula.

Wait, the problem states that the relative entropy measure is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So if rho is a pure state, trace(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b = - trace(tau ln tau). But trace(tau ln tau) is S(tau) = - S(tau), so del_b = - (- S(tau)) = S(tau). So del_b = S(tau).

But wait, tau is the reference Gaussian state. So if tau is a thermal Gaussian state, which is mixed, then S(tau) is positive. So del_b would be positive, which makes sense as a measure of non-Gaussianity. But then, if rho is non-Gaussian, and tau is a Gaussian state (like a coherent state), then it's possible that the entropy difference is positive.

Wait, but if tau is a pure Gaussian state, like a coherent state, then S(tau) is zero. So del_b would be zero. But that's not right because the state is non-Gaussian. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Another thought: perhaps the relative entropy is defined as S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But in the problem, it's
