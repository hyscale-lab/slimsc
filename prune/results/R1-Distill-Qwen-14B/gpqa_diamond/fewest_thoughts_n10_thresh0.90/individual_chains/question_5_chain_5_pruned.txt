Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, right, the operator for spin, I think. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices. So the operator P is probably the spin operator in some direction. Since the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, the unit vector n must be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in x-z plane, φ is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P is proportional to the Pauli matrices multiplied by the components of n.

Wait, the spin operator in direction n is given by ħ/2 times (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). So in this case, n is in x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

But wait, the components P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as specific matrices. Let me look at them again. 

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the σ_x matrix. P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is σ_y. And P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is σ_z.

So the operator P here is a spin-1/2 operator. But the question is about the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator along n would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n is in x-z plane, so n_y = 0.

Wait, no, because the direction is arbitrary, the operator is along vector n, so P = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z) * (ħ/2). But since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0, so P = (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) * (ħ/2).

But the problem says the operator is P along direction n. So the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and we need to find the eigenvector.

So, the eigenvalue equation is (P) |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>. Wait, no, because the operator is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)(ħ/2), so the eigenvalue equation would be (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)(ħ/2) |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, but wait, no—the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)(ħ/2) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So the eigenvalue equation simplifies to (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>. So we're looking for the eigenvector where the operator (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) has eigenvalue 1.

Wait, let me think again. The operator along n is (n · σ) * (ħ/2). So for eigenvalue +ħ/2, the equation is (n · σ) (ħ/2) |ψ> = (+ħ/2)|ψ>, which implies (n · σ) |ψ> = |ψ>. So the eigenvalue for (n · σ) is 1.

So the eigenvector |ψ> is an eigenvector of n · σ with eigenvalue 1.

Alternatively, since σ · n is the same as the spin component along n, the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. So the eig
