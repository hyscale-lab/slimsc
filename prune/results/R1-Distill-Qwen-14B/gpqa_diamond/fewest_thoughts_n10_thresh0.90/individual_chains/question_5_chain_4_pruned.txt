Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. It's about finding the eigenvector of an operator corresponding to a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question says that the operator is denoted as P, and it's a vector operator with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The problem is asking for the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh right, so the operator here is P, which is a vector operator, meaning it's like a combination of its components.

Wait, P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is in the x-z plane, which means the vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle phi would be 0 since it's in the x-z plane, so the direction is along θ from the z-axis.

So the operator P along n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the respective direction cosines. That is, P = n · (Px, Py, Pz). Let me write that out. The operator P would be:

P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ.

So substituting the given components:

P = (sinθ)(Px) + (0)(Py) + (cosθ)(Pz)

Each of Px, Py, Pz is a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write each one:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So substituting these into P:

P = (sinθ)(ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

The (1,1) element is cosθ * 1.

The (1,2) element is sinθ * 1.

The (2,1) element is sinθ * 1.

The (2,2) element is cosθ * (-1).

So the matrix inside is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each element step by step.

The first term (from Px) is:

0 1

1 0

Multiply by sinθ:

sinθ * 0 → 0, sinθ * 1 → sinθ

Similarly, the second term (from Pz) is:

1 0

0 -1

Multiply by cosθ:

cosθ, 0

0, -cosθ

So adding Px part and Pz part:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no. Let's add the matrices:

First row, first column: cosθ * 1 (from Pz) + 0 (from Px) → cosθ

First row, second column: 0 (from Pz) + 1 * sinθ (from Px) → sinθ

Second row, first column: 1 * sinθ (from Px) + 0 (from Pz) → sinθ

Second row, second column: -1 * cosθ (from Pz) + 0 → -cosθ.

So the matrix is correct.

Thus, P = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, wait. The matrix is actually:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So now, we're looking for the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, because the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

But wait, P is (ħ/2) times that matrix, so the matrix in the eigenvalue equation is the matrix we have. Let's denote M as the matrix:

M = [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
       [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Because P = (ħ/2) M.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

M |ψ> = |ψ>

So we're looking for eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1.

So the equation is M |ψ> = |ψ>

Which can be written as (M - I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So M - I is:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Compute the determinant:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0

Let me compute each term:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1*(cosθ -1)

= -cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ +1

= -cos²θ + 1

Then subtract (sinθ)^2:

So determinant is [ -cos²θ + 1 ] - sin²θ = 0

- cos²θ + 1 - sin²θ = 0

But we know that cos²θ + sin²θ =1, so 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ. So substituting:

sin²θ - sin²θ = 0 → 0 =0. Which is consistent, so the equation is correct.

So the eigenvectors satisfy the equation (M - I) |ψ> = 0.

So let's find the eigenvectors by solving the system.

The equations are:

(cosθ -1) ψ₁ + sinθ ψ₂ = 0

sinθ ψ₁ + (-cosθ -1) ψ₂ = 0

We can take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) ψ₁ + sinθ ψ₂ = 0 → (1 - cosθ) ψ₁ = sinθ ψ₂ → ψ₂ = [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] ψ₁

Note that (1 - cosθ)/sinθ can be simplified.

We know that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] = tan(θ/2 )

So ψ₂ = tan(θ/2) ψ₁

So the eigenvector can be written as ψ = [ ψ₁, tan(θ/2) ψ₁ ].

We can set ψ₁ = 1 for simplicity, then ψ₂ = tan(θ/2).

But we need to normalize the eigenvector. So let's compute the normalization condition.

The components are ψ₁ = 1, ψ₂ = tan(θ/2).

So |ψ₁|² + |ψ₂|² = |1|² + |tanθ/2|² = 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2 ) = 1 / cos²(θ/2 )

So the normalization factor is cos(θ/2 ), because 1/sqrt(1/cos²) )= cos(θ/2 )

Wait, the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( 1 + tan²(θ/2) ) ) = 1 / sqrt( sec²(θ/2 ) ) ) = cos(θ/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

|ψ> = [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ]

Wait, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2 ) = sin(theta/2 )

Wait, more precisely, the components are:

ψ₁ = 1 * cos(theta/2 )

ψ₂ = tan(theta/2 ) * cos(theta/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2 ) / cos(theta/2 ) ] * cos(theta/2 ) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate again. The unnormalized vector is [1, tan(theta/2 ) ].

After normalization, it's [ 1 / sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2 )) , tan(theta/2 ) / sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2 )) ]

But 1 + tan² = sec², so sqrt
