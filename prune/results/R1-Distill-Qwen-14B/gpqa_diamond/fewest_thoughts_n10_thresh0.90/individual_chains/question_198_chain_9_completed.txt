--- Full Content ---
Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand all the parts.

So, the problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I'm being asked to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

First, I should recall what stability constants are. Stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. For a metal-ligand complex, the stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal and ligands. So, for each complex, the higher the β, the more it will form.

In this case, the cobalt is forming complexes with thiocyanate (SCN-). The complexes are Co(SCN)n^2−n, where n is the number of thiocyanate ligands. The given β values are for each step of the complex formation.

Wait, but the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So that suggests that the cobalt forms complexes with 1, 2, 3, 4 thiocyanate ligands. So, the complexes would be Co(SCN)^1+ (n=1), Co(SCN)₂^0 (n=2), Co(SCN)₃^- (n=3), Co(SCN)₄^2- (n=4). Each β represents the step from the previous complex.

So, β1 is for the formation of the first complex: Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)^+, β1 = 9. Then β2 is for the next step: Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)₂, β2=40. Wait, but wait, the stability constant for the overall complex would be the product of the stepwise constants. So for the overall complex with n ligands, the overall β is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, but wait—no. Each β is the stepwise stability constant. So the overall β for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 through βn. So β_total for Co(SCN)_n^(2−n) is the product of β1*β2*...*βn.

So in this problem, we have four possible complexes: n=1, 2, 3, 4. The stability constants for each complex are:

n=1: β_total = β1 = 9
n=2: β_total = β1*β2 = 9*40 = 360
n=3: β1*β2*β3 = 9*40*63 = let's calculate that: 9*40 is 360, 360 *63 = 22680
n=4: β1*β2*β3*β4 = 22680 *16 = 362880.

Wait, but wait a second. That would mean that the complex with four ligands has the highest β, so it's the most stable. But the question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato probably means two SCN- ligands, so the Co(SCN)₂ complex, which is n=2. Is that right?

Wait, wait, wait. Let me check. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands, right? So the complex Co(SCN)₂ would be that. So the question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)₂ in the solution.

Wait, but I have to consider all possible species. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the complexes. That is, [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃^-] + [Co(SCN)₄^2-}] = 1e-2 M.

But wait, when you have multiple complexes, the distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligands. The problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) among all the Co species.

Hmm. So I think the approach is to model the distribution of the different complexes based on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

Another approach is to use the concept of the formation of complexes in solution. The fraction of each complex can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal ions.

The general approach for such problems is to calculate the fraction of each complex, which is equal to the product of the successive β's divided by the sum of all possible products plus the free ion term.

Wait, not exactly. The fraction for each species is (β_total) * [L]^n / (1 + sum_{i=1 to n} (β_total_i * [L]^i) ) )

Wait, perhaps another way. The fraction of each species is (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [L]^n ) / ( [M] + sum_{k=1 to n} (β_1...β_k [L]^k ) )

Wait, I think the correct formula for the fraction of the complex with n ligands is:

f_n = (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [L]^n ) / ( [M] + sum_{k=1 to n} (β_1 β_2 ... β_k [L]^k ) )

But wait, [M] is the concentration of the free metal ion, Co²+.

But in this problem, the total cobalt concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all the species (including Co²+) is 1e-2 M. But I'm not sure if the ligand concentration is in excess, which would imply that [L] (thiocyanate) is approximately constant.

Wait, the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the cobalt concentration. So in such cases, the ligand concentration is considered constant (i.e., [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M). Therefore, the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the stepwise formation constants.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the formation of complexes in a stepwise manner, where each step's contribution depends on the β and the ligand concentration.

But I might need to use the concept of the formation of the complexes step by step, considering each possible n.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this as a distribution of the species based on the β values and the ligand concentration.

Wait, another approach is to consider that the fraction of each complex is determined by the product of the stability constants multiplied by the ligand concentration raised to the number of ligands, divided by the sum of all such terms plus the free metal ion.

Wait, let me think about it. The fraction of the species with n ligands is:

f_n = (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / ( [Co²+] + sum_{k=1 to 4} (β_1 β_2 ... β_k [SCN^-]^k ) )

But wait, [Co²+] is not given directly, but the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. The sum of all species is 1e-2 M.

Hmm. So the total is [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃^-] + [Co(SCN)₄^2-] = 1e-2 M.

But since [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the total cobalt concentration (1e-2 M), the ligand concentration is effectively constant and doesn't change significantly. So we can model the fractions based on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

Wait, I think the correct way to approach this is to calculate the fraction of each complex using the formula:

f_n = (β_total(n) * [L]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0 to 4} (β_total(k) [L]^k ) )

where β_total(k) is the overall stability constant for the k-th complex. Here, k=0 would be the free metal ion, Co²+, which has β_total(0) = 1 (since it's the starting point).

Wait, but the β_total for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs.

Wait, let's compute the β_total for each n:

n=0: β0 = 1 (free Co²+)
n=1: β1 = 9
n=2: β1*β2 = 9*40 = 360
n=3: 9*40*63= 22680
n=4: 9*40*63*16 = 22680 *16 = 362880

So the fractions are f_n = (β_total(n) [L]^n ) / ( [M] + sum_{k=1}^4 β_total(k) [L]^k )

Wait, but [M] is the concentration of the free Co²+ which is part of the denominator. Alternatively, since the total concentration is 1e-2 M, perhaps a better approach is to express all species in terms of [Co²+] and the ligand concentration.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion.

The fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β_total(n) [L]^n ) / ( 1 + sum_{k=1}^4 (β_total(k) [L]^k ) )

But wait, the denominator would be the sum of all possible terms, including the free ion. But in our case, [Co²+] = x, and the sum of all species is x + (β1 [L])x + (β1 β2 [L]^2)x + ... ) = x (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + ... )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me set up the problem again.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then the concentrations of the various complexes can be written in terms of x and the βs and [L] (which is 0.1 M).

So,

[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 x [L]
[Co(SCN)₂] = β1 β2 x [L]^2
[Co(SCN)₃^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [L]^3
[Co(SCN)₄^2-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [L]^4

The total concentration is x + β1 x [L] + β1 β2 x [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [L]^4 = 1e-2 M.

We can factor out x:

x [ 1 + β1 [L] + (β1 β2 [L]^2) + (β1 β2 β3 [L]^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4) ] = c

Where c = 1e-2 M.

So x = c / [ 1 + β1 [L] + (β1 β2 [L]^2) + (β1 β2 β3 [L]^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4) ]

But since [L] is 0.1 M, let me calculate each term:

Compute each term:

Term 1: 1

Term 2: β1 [L] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term3: β1 β2 [L]^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 = 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 = 362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288

Now sum all the terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6 =5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So the denominator is 64.468.

Thus, x = (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Wait, so [Co²+] is 1.55e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex can be calculated as:

[Co(SCN)^+] = β1 [Co²+] [L] = 9 * (1.55e-4) * 0.1 = 9 * 1.55e-5 = 1.395e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)₂] = β1 β2 [Co²+] [L]^2 = 9*40 * 1.55e-4 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 1.55e-4 * 0.01 = 360 * 1.55e-6 = 5.58e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute that again. 9*40 is 360. [L]^2 is 0.01. So:

[Co(SCN)₂] = 360 * (1.55e-4) * 0.01 = 360 * 1.55e-6 = 5.58e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)₃^-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co²+] [L]^3 = 22680 * 1.55e-4 * 0.001 = 22680 * 1.55e-7 ≈ 3.5178e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute that step by step:

22680 * 1.55e-4 = 22680 * 0.000155 ≈ 3.5178 M? No, wait, 22680 * 1.55e-4 is 22680 * 0.000155 = 3.5178.

Wait, no, wait: 22680 * 1.55e-4 = 22680 * 0.000155. Let's compute 22680 * 0.0001 = 2.268, and 22680 * 0.000055 = 1.2474. So total is approximately 3.5154.

But then multiply by [L]^3, which is 0.1^3=0.001.

So 3.5154 * 0.001 = 0.0035154 M.

So [Co(SCN)₃^-] ≈ 3.515e-3 M.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)₄^2-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co²+] [L]^4 = 362880 * 1.55e-4 * 0.0001.

Compute 362880 * 1.55e-4 =362880 * 0.000155 = let's see, 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288, 362880 * 0.000055 = approx 19.9584. So total 56.2464.

Then multiply by 0.0001: 56.2464 * 0.0001 = 0.00562464 M.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because [Co(SCN)4] would be 362880 * [Co²+] * (0.1)^4.

So, [Co(SCN)₄^2-] = 362880 * (1.55e-4) * (0.1)^4.

Let me compute that.

1.55e-4 is 0.000155.

0.1^4 = 0.0001.

So 362880 * 0.000155 = 362880 * 1.55e-4.

I'll compute that: 362880 * 1.55 = ?

Well, 362880 * 1 = 362880, 362880 *0.55= about 199,584. So total around 562,464. Then multiply by 1e-4: 562464 * 1e-4 = 56.2464.

Then multiply by 0.0001 (the [L]^4 term): 56.2464 * 0.0001 = 0.00562464 M.

So [Co(SCN)₄^2-] ≈ 0.00562464 M.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculations again. Because when I sum all the concentrations, the total should be 1e-2 M.

Let me sum up the concentrations:

[Co²+] = 1.55e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)^+] = 1.395e-4.

[Co(SCN)₂] = 5.58e-4.

[Co(SCN)₃^-] ≈ 3.515e-3.

[Co(SCN)₄^2-] ≈ 0.00562464.

Let me add them:

1.55e-4 = 0.000155

+1.395e-4 = 0.0001395 → total 0.0002945

+5.58e-4 =0.000558 → total 0.0008525

+0.003515 → 0.0043675

+0.00562464 → 0.010 (approximately 0.01). That adds up to around 0.01 M, which matches the total given. So that's correct.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂], which is 5.58e-4 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So the percentage is (5.58e-4 / 1e-2) * 100% = 0.0558 *100% =5.58%? Wait, that can't be right because none of the options is that low. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Did I calculate [Co(SCN)₂] correctly? Let me recheck.

Co(SCN)₂: β1 β2 [Co²+] [L]^2.

β1=9, β2=40.

So overall β for n=2 is 9*40=360.

[L] =0.1.

So [Co(SCN)₂] = 360 * [Co²+] * (0.1)^2.

Wait, [Co²+] is x=1.55e-4.

So 360 * 1.55e-4 = ?

360 * 1.55e-4 = 360 * 0.000155 = 0.0558.

Then multiplied by (0.1)^2=0.01: 0.0558 * 0.01 = 0.000558 M.

Which is 5.58e-4 M.

So that's correct.

But that gives [Co(SCN)₂] as 5.58e-4 M, which is 0.0558% of the total? No, wait, no: the total is 1e-2 M. So 5.58e-4 / 1e-2 = 0.0558 → 5.58%.

But none of the options is 5.58%. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the fractions. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants provided are not for the overall complexes but for the stepwise formation. So the β1 is for the first ligand, β2 is for the second, etc. So the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs up to that point. Alternatively, perhaps the β values are cumulative? No, wait, the standard definition is that the stability constants are stepwise. So β1 is K for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should model the distribution using the formation of each complex step by step, considering each possible step.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the distribution of the species using the logarithms and the conditional formation constants, but perhaps there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the dominant species. Since the ligand is in excess, the higher-order complexes will form more. So the highest β is for n=4, so the majority will be in the fourth complex. But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, n=2.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, [Co(SCN)₂] is only 5.58e-4, which is 5.58% of the total. But the options are much higher. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator when calculating x.

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator:

The denominator is the sum of the terms:

1 + β1 [L] + β1β2 [L]^2 + β1β2β3 [L]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [L]^4.

I have [L] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term again:

Term1: 1.

Term2: β1 [L] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term3: β1 β2 [L]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 =9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 =22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 =9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4 =362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

So x=1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 0.000155 M.

So [Co²+] is 1.55e-4 M.

Then, [Co(SCN)₂] is β1β2 x [L]^2 =360 *1.55e-4 *0.01.

Wait, 360 * 1.55e-4 is 0.0558.

Multiply by 0.01 (since [L]^2=0.01) gives 0.000558 M.

So 5.58e-4 M is [Co(SCN)₂].

The total is 1e-2 M, so 5.58e-4 /1e-2 = 0.0558 → 5.58%.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not stepwise. Let me think: if βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands, then the calculation would be different.

Wait, but the problem states that β1=9, β2=40, etc., which suggests stepwise constants, because β usually represents stepwise formation constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different notation where βn is the overall constant for the complex with n ligands. Let's try that approach.

If that's the case, the β for each complex is:

n=1: β1=9

n=2: β2=40

n=3: β3=63

n=4: β4=16.

Wait, but that would mean that the overall β for n=2 is 40, and for n=4 is 16, which is lower. That doesn't make sense because the formation of higher complexes should have higher stability. So perhaps the stepwise approach is the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [Co(SCN)2]. Let me check again.

[Co(SCN)₂] = (β1 β2) * [Co²+] * [L]^2.

β1 β2 is 9*40=360.

[L]=0.1, [L]^2=0.01.

[Co²+] is 1.55e-4.

So 360 * 1.55e-4 = 0.0558.

0.0558 * 0.01 = 0.000558 M.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the problem is about the blue color, which is associated with the Co(SCN)₂ complex, but perhaps it's the tetraaqua or another complex. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different definition of the stability constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the fraction of the complex considering that each ligand is added and the β's are cumulative. Wait, perhaps I should model the formation of each complex step by step.

Another approach: The fraction of each species is given by the product of the β's up to that point, multiplied by [L]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms plus the free metal.

So the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n ) / ( [M] + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 )

But [M] is the free Co²+ concentration, which is x.

Wait, but the denominator is the same as the denominator I used earlier, which is 64.468 x.

Wait, no. Because x is [M], so the denominator in the fraction would be (x) (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + ... )

Wait, so the fraction is (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n x ) / ( x (1 + β1 [L] + ... ) ) = (β1...βn [L]^n ) / denominator.

So the fractions are determined by (β1...βn [L]^n ) / denominator.

So the fraction f_n = (β_total(n) [L]^n ) / denominator.

In this case, the denominator is 64.468.

So f_n for each species is:

n=0: [Co²+] → 1/64.468 ≈ 0.0155 → 1.55%

n=1: (9 * 0.1 ) /64.468 → 0.9 /64.468 ≈0.014 → 1.4%

n=2: (360 * 0.01 ) /64.468 →3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0557 →5.57%

n=3: (22680 *0.001 ) /64.468 →22.68 /64.468≈0.3517 →35.17%

n=4: (362880 *0.0001 ) /64.468 →36.288 /64.468≈0.5625 →56.25%

Wait, but the sum of these fractions should be 100%: 1.55 +1.4+5.57+35.17+56.25=100%.

So, the percentage for n=2 (dithiocyanato) is approximately 5.57%, which is about 5.6%. But the options don't include that. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of the stability constants, where βn is the overall constant for the complex with n ligands, not stepwise. Let's try that.

In that case, the overall β for each complex is given as:

n=1: β1=9

n=2: β2=40

n=3: β3=63

n=4: β4=16

Wait, that's strange because β4 is less than β3, which would imply the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is unlikely. So I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently, and the β's are given as the overall constants, but that would be unusual.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. The problem says, "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Hmm, perhaps these are the overall βn for each complex.

So for n=1: β1=9 → K1=9.

n=2: β2=40 → K2=40.

n=3: β3=63 → K3=63.

n=4: β4=16 → K4=16.

Wait, but that would mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which might not make sense. But perhaps that's the case.

So if that's the case, then the fraction of each species would be calculated using the overall βn.

So the general formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (βn [L]^n ) / ( [M] + sum_{k=1 to 4} (βk [L]^k ) )

But that's not correct because each complex is built upon the previous ones. Alternatively, perhaps it's more appropriate to use the overall βn for each complex without considering the stepwise formation.

Wait, perhaps each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands, without considering the stepwise addition. So for n=1, β1=9. For n=2, β2=40, etc.

In that case, the overall β for each complex is:

n=1: β1=9

n=2: β2=40

n=3: β3=63

n=4: β4=16.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the total concentration is the sum of all species, each multiplied by their respective βn [L]^n.

Another approach is to consider that the concentration of each complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (βn [L]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} (βk [L]^k ) )

But wait, that may not account for the metal ion correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the fractions are given by:

f_n = (βn [L]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0 to 4} (βk [L]^k ) ), where β0=1.

But in that case, the fractions would be:

Compute numerator and denominator:

Denominator = 1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4.

Which is:

1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001).

Compute each term:

1 →1

9*0.1=0.9 → sum 1.9

40*0.01=0.4 → sum 2.3

63*0.001=0.063 → sum 2.363

16*0.0001=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Now, compute numerator for each n:

n=0: 1 → 1/2.3646 ≈0.423 →42.3%

n=1:9*0.1=0.9 →0.9/2.3646≈0.381→38.1%

n=2:40*0.01=0.4 →0.4/2.3646≈0.169→16.9%

n=3:63*0.001=0.063 →0.063/2.3646≈0.0266→2.66%

n=4:16*0.0001=0.0016 →≈0.000675→0.0675%.

Wait, but the sum of these fractions would be 42.3 +38.1 +16.9 +2.66 +0.0675= about 100%, which makes sense.

So the fraction for n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So according to this, the answer would be D)16.9%.

But in this scenario, the overall βn are given as per the problem statement. However, this approach assumes that βn is the overall stability constant for the n-th complex, not the stepwise. But earlier, I thought that β's were stepwise.

But wait, the problem states that β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. If these are overall βn for each complex, then the approach would be as above.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects this approach, leading to option D.

But considering that the sum is 100% when using this method, and the options include D as 16.9%, which matches the fraction for n=2 in this calculation.

Therefore, the correct answer is D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of species based on the given stability constants and the ligand concentration. The stability constants provided are interpreted as the overall stability constants for each complex, not stepwise constants. The complexes are:

- Co²+ (free ion)
- Co(SCN)⁺ (n=1, β₁=9)
- Co(SCN)₂ (n=2, β₂=40)
- Co(SCN)₃⁻ (n=3, β₃=63)
- Co(SCN)₄²⁻ (n=4, β₄=16)

The fraction of each species is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

where \( \beta_0 = 1 \) (for the free ion Co²+), and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The denominator is the sum of all terms, including the free ion and all complexes.

### Step 1: Calculate the denominator
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \cdot 0.1^4)
\]

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of Co(SCN)₂ (n=2)
The numerator for \( n=2 \) is:
\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.1^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4
\]

The fraction of Co(SCN)₂ is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
