Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. We have a solution where the cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given for four different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the complex with the highest β is the most favored, right?

Wait, but what's the structure here? The complexes are Co(SCN)_n^2+ or something like that. So each β represents the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

So the complexes are:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^2+−n+2? Or maybe their charges are different. I'm a bit confused about the charges, but maybe I can ignore that for now since the main point is about the distribution based on the stability constants.

There are four complexes, so n goes from 1 to 4? Or maybe it's the number of ligands, but the question mentions dithiocyanato, which is two SCN ligands. Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the one with two SCN- ions.

So the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^something. But I'm getting off track. The question is about the percentage of this particular complex in the solution.

I think I need to calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2] complex relative to all possible cobalt species. So, the solution contains the free Co^2+, and the various complexes from n=1 to n=4.

But wait, the problem says "all cobalt containing species", which includes all the complexes and the free ion, right? So the total is the sum of all species, each with their own concentrations, determined by the stability constants.

The approach is to use the stability constants to find the distribution of each species. Since β is the formation constant, which tells us how much the complex forms from the metal and ligand.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the β and the concentrations of the ligand and the metal.

Wait, the general approach is to consider the log of the β and the concentrations. Alternatively, using the conditional formation constant. Or maybe it's the same as the distribution of each complex in solution.

I think the way to approach this is to compute the fraction of each complex using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n) / (sum over k=1 to 4 of β_k [Co^2+][SCN^-]^k ) 

Wait, but wait, the initial metal is Co^2+ and the ligand is SCN^-. Each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+−n? Because each SCN- is -1, so n of them would make the charge 2+−n. But I'm not sure if that's important for the calculation. I think the formation constants already take the charges into account, so perhaps I don't need to worry about that.

Wait, the problem says the stability constants are given, so each β represents the overall stability for each complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, perhaps? I'm not entirely sure about the charges, but maybe it's not necessary for the calculation.

But I'm trying to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is probably [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the Co^2+ with two SCN- ions attached. So for n=2, β2 is 40.

So to find the fraction f2 of the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, I need to calculate the numerator as β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2, and the denominator is the sum over all βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n for n=1 to 4.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. That means the sum of all Co species (free and complexes) is 1e-2 M. Oh, but wait, the initial concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]1 + [Co(SCN)2] + ... = 1e-2 M.

Hmm, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex based on the stability constants and the ligand and metal concentrations.

Alternatively, think about the situation: the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the metal concentration (1e-2 M). So the complexes are more likely to form, but which one?

The formation of each complex depends on β and the ligand concentration. The higher β and the higher [SCN^-] will lead to more formation of that complex.

Wait, but for each complex, the effective formation constant (or the conditional constant) depends on the concentrations. The conditional constant Kf' is β multiplied by [SCN^-]^n, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the formula f_n = (β_n [M][L]^n) / Σ (β_k [M][L]^k) ), where M is the metal ion (Co^2+), and L is the ligand (SCN^-).

Wait, but [M] is the same for all terms, so [M] would factor out. So f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / Σ (β_k [L]^k) )

So in this case, [L] is 0.1 M.

So for each n, calculate β_n * (0.1)^n, then sum all four terms, and the fraction for n=2 is [β2*(0.1)^2] divided by the sum of all βn*(0.1)^n.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Yes, because each species [Co(SCN)_n] is formed from Co^2+ and n SCN^-, and the fraction is proportional to βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n. Since [Co^2+] is the same for all, it can be factored out from numerator and denominator. So f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum over k of βk [SCN^-]^k )

So the steps are:

1. For each n (1 to 4), compute βn * (0.1)^n.

2. Sum all these values to get the denominator.

3. The fraction f2 is (β2*(0.1)^2) / denominator.

Then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Let me compute each term:

n=1: β1=9, (0.1)^1=0.1. So 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: β2=40, (0.1)^2=0.01. 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

n=3: β3=63, (0.1)^3=0.001. 63 * 0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4=16, (0.1)^4=0.0001. 16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Now, sum all these:

0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363; 1.363 + 0.0016 = 1.3646.

So denominator is 1.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 1.3646 ≈ 0.2927, which is about 29.27%.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, wait, the options are A) ~42%, B) ~25.6%, C) ~38%, D) ~16.9%.

Hmm, that suggests I might have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the terms are:

β1 * (0.1)^1 =9*0.1=0.9.

β2 * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4.

β3 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

β4 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Adding them all:

0.9 +0.4 is 1.3; plus 0.063 makes 1.363; plus 0.0016 makes 1.3646.

So denominator is 1.3646.

So fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 1.3646.

Compute that: 0.4 divided by 1.3646.

Let me calculate: 0.4 / 1.3646 ≈ 0.2927, which is about 29.27%.

But wait, none of the options are near 29%. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which is two SCN- ions. So that's correct for n=2.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem defines the stability constants differently. Maybe β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

But that shouldn't affect the calculation, as the fractions are based on the given β's.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the total concentration. Wait, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. But in the calculation, I assumed that [Co^2+] is 1e-2 M. But no, because [Co^2+] is part of the solution, but the total is the sum of all species, including the complexes. So perhaps the approach is to compute the fraction of each species relative to the total metal and ligand concentrations.

Wait, maybe I should model the problem using the formation constants and the ligand and metal concentrations to find the distribution.

Alternative approach: The fraction of each complex is determined by the product of the formation constant and the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands.

Wait, another thought: the distribution depends on the effective formation constants, which are the βn multiplied by [SCN^-]^n, since each complex requires n SCN- ligands.

So the effective formation constant for each complex is K_eff,n = βn × [SCN^-]^n.

Then, the ratio of each complex's concentration to the total concentration is proportional to K_eff,n.

Wait, but the problem is that the [Co^2+] is 1e-2 M, but the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. But perhaps the way I calculated before is correct, and the problem is that the answer I get (around 29%) isn't one of the options, which suggests I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate each term.

n=1: β1=9, (0.1)^1=0.1 → 9 * 0.1 =0.9.

n=2: 40 * 0.01=0.4.

n=3:63 * 0.001=0.063.

n=4:16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 0.9+0.4=1.3; +0.063 → 1.363; +0.0016 →1.3646.

So denominator is 1.3646.

Then, fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 1.3646 = 0.2927 → 29.27%.

Hmm, but the options are given as A:42.3%, B:25.6%, C:38.1%, D:16.9%.

So none is close to 29%. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)2]^something, but maybe the stability constant for dithiocyanato is β2=40, but perhaps the question is asking about a different complex, like the tetra or tri, which could have a higher percentage.

Wait, let me think again. Perhaps the calculation is correct, and the answer is not among the options, which is unlikely. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex relative to all cobalt species, not the others.

Wait, but wait, maybe the stability constants are given for the stepwise formation, not the overall formation. Oh! Because sometimes stability constants can be given for each step, like β1 for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. But wait, the β given here are for the overall complexes, not the stepwise. Because if β1=9 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2=40 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc., then the overall β would be β1, β1β2, etc.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I think they are the overall stability constants for each complex. So [Co(SCN)1]^+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)2]^0 has β2=40, etc.

Wait, but perhaps the stability constants are in terms of log β, but no, the problem states the β values.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should involve the logarithms of the β values. No, I don't think so. Because the fractions are based on the β multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formation constant is given as the logarithm of the β, but no, the problem gives β as 9, 40, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions considering the fact that the complexes can't all form at the same time, so the ligand concentration is limited.

Wait, but the main issue is that my calculation leads to about 29%, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the [Co^2+] isn't 1e-2 M. Because when the complexes form, the free [Co^2+] decreases. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect, and I need to model the system with the formation of complexes.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

The total cobalt concentration is c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

But [CoSCN]^+ is the first complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 the second, etc.

Each complex can be expressed in terms of the free [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

But given the high [SCN^-] (0.1 M) and lower [Co^2+] (1e-2 M), it's likely that most of the Co is in the form of complexes.

But perhaps the correct approach is to express each complex's concentration in terms of the free Co^2+ and the ligand.

So for each complex:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So the total cobalt is:

[Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n = c_total.

Factor out [Co^2+]:

[Co^2+] (1 + sum_{n=1 to4} β_n [SCN^-]^n ) = c_total.

So [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + sum_{n=1 to4} β_n [SCN^-]^n )

Which is similar to what I did before, but now I'm calculating the free [Co^2+] and then using it to find the concentrations of each complex.

Once I have [Co^2+], I can find each complex's concentration.

Wait, let me compute this.

Given c_total = 1e-2 M.

[SCN^-} = 0.1 M.

Compute sum = 1 + (β1 [SCN^-]^1 + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, no, because earlier I thought the sum is sum_{n=1 to4} beta_n (scn)^n. But now, adding 1 in front, so:

sum becomes 1 + (9*(0.1) +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001)).

Wait, let me compute:

9*0.1 = 0.9

40*0.01=0.4

63*0.001=0.063

16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum of these is 0.9 +0.4 = 1.3; +0.063 →1.363; +0.0016 →1.3646.

So sum = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.

So [Co^2+] = 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 4.226e-3 M.

Wait, but that's the free [Co^2+]. Now, each complex's concentration is βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So for each complex, the concentration is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * (4.226e-3) * (0.1)^n.

Then, to find the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, which is n=2, I compute:

([Co(SCN)_2] / total_cobalt ) *100.

But total_cobalt is 1e-2 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * 4.226e-3 * (0.1)^2 = 40 *4.226e-3 * 0.01 = 40 *4.226e-5 = 1.6904e-3 M.

The total cobalt is 1e-2 M.

So the fraction is 1.6904e-3 / 1e-2 = 0.16904 → 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, this is 16.9%, which is option D.

But earlier, when I calculated the fraction as (0.4 ) / 1.3646, I got about 29%, but that approach didn't consider the free [Co^2+]. Oh, right! Because I think I forgot that the [Co^2+] isn't 1e-2 M; the sum of all species is 1e-2 M, so [Co^2+] is much less, and thus the fractions are affected.

So the correct approach is to compute the free [Co^2+] first, then compute each complex's concentration, then find the percentage.

So in this case, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 40 * [Co^2+] * 0.01.

Wait, but [Co^2+] is 4.226e-3 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] =40 * 4.226e-3 * (0.1)^2 =40 *4.226e-3 * 0.01 = 40 *4.226e-5 = 1.6904e-3 M.

Total cobalt is 1e-2 M. So (1.6904e-3 / 1e-2 ) *100 = 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but why earlier calculation gave 29%? Because in that approach, I didn't factor in the free [Co^2+] correctly. I think the correct approach is to compute [Co^2+] first, then use it to find each complex's concentration.

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The stability constants are provided as β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16, and the concentrations are [Co(II)] = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Complex**: The fraction of each cobalt complex is proportional to the product of its stability constant (βn), the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands (n), and the free cobalt concentration ([Co^2+]). The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species, including the free ion and all complexes.

   The fraction of a complex is given by:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [SCN^-]^n}{\sum_{k=1}^{4} \beta_k [SCN^-]^k}
   \]
   where the free cobalt concentration, [Co^2+], cancels out as it is common to all terms.

2. **Effective Formation Constants**: Compute the effective formation constants for each complex:
   - For \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [SCN^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
   - For \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [SCN^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
   - For \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [SCN^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
   - For \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [SCN^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

   The sum of these terms is:
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{4} \beta_k [SCN^-]^k = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646
   \]

3. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**: The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [SCN^-]^2}{\sum_{k=1}^{4} \beta_k [SCN^-]^k} = \frac{0.4}{1.3646} \approx 0.2927
   \]
   This corresponds to approximately 29.27%.

4. **Revisiting the Free Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration is given as 10^-2 M. The free cobalt concentration, [Co^2+], is calculated by:
   \[
   [Co^2+] = \frac{c_{\text{total}}}{1 + \sum_{k=1}^{4} \beta_k [SCN^-]^k} = \frac{10^{-2}}{1 + 1.3646} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**: Using the free cobalt concentration, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = \beta_2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (4.226 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot (0.1)^2 = 1.6904 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

6. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**: The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 relative to the total cobalt concentration is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}]}{c_{\text{total}}} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{1.6904 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \right) \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
