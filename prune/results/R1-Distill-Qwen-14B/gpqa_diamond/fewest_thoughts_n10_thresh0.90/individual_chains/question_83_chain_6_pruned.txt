Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the concentration decreases, which affects the pH. Then, when you titrate it, the pH changes based on how much NaOH has been added. Let me break this down into parts.

First, the initial dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water will double the volume, so the new concentration should be half of 0.05 M. Let me calculate that. 0.05 divided by 2 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, when you dilute a solution, the moles stay the same but the volume increases. So, moles of acetic acid before dilution: M * V = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

Now, the next part is the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The titration process involves neutralizing the acetic acid with NaOH.

First, I should find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid in solution.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (40 cm³) = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, moles NaOH needed is 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

So, what's the situation at 25% titration and at equivalence point?

At 25% titration, we've neutralized a quarter of the acetic acid. So, let's think about that.

Wait, let's model the reaction. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So, when we add NaOH, it reacts with the acetic acid to form sodium acetate and water.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, the moles of NaOH added are 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: initial 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO⁻ (acet
