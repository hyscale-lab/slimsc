Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, okay.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration decreases, which would make it less strong, so the pH would be higher than before. Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial solution is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. When you dilute it, the dissociation increases a bit because of Le Chatelier's principle. But the pH would actually increase because the solution is more diluted, making it weaker, but wait, no, wait. Because when you dilute a weak acid, the degree of ionization increases, but since the initial concentration is low, the pH goes up a little. Hmm, maybe I should just calculate the diluted acetic acid's concentration first.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid (let's call it CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume. The volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, what's the equivalence point? At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001, as before. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. That's when 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles. So how much NaOH is that? It would be 0.00025 moles / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, okay, but for the pH at 25% titration, I think I need to consider the buffer solution that's formed before the equivalence point. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they'll react to form acetate ions and water. So the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate. So the solution will be a buffer of acetic acid and acetate ions. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

What's the pKa? The given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 has a log of about 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, but 1.85 is higher, so 4.73). So pKa is about 4.73.

Now, the ratio [A^-]/[HA]. At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to conjugate base. So moles of CH3COOH initially in the diluted solution is 0.001, and 25% of that is 0.00025. So moles of CH3COOH left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Moles of acetate (A^-) formed are 0.00025.

But wait, the total volume at this point? The initial diluted solution is 40 cm³, and we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So concentrations are:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = about 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. Hmm, that's about 4.25. Let me see the options.

Looking back: option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which is higher than expected. Wait, wait. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, maybe the volume is different. The initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, adding 2.5 cm³ makes it 42.5 cm³. But wait, in the initial dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, then adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH. So 40 + 2.5 is 42.5 cm³, yes.

Wait another thought: when the solution is diluted, the initial concentration is 0.025 M. The pKa is correct at 4.73. So the buffer equation would be accurate.

Wait, but I'm getting pH around 4.25 here. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 as the first pH, and option D is 4.57. Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated the ratio.

Wait, let me recalculate the ratio [A^-]/[HA].

Moles HA = 0.00075, A^- = 0.00025. So in the same solution, the ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) which is approximately -0.477. So 4.73-0.477 is 4.253, which rounds to 4.25. So pH is about 4.25.

Looking at options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57; that's higher than that. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me check.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Correct. Then, when 25% is titrated, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have been neutralized. So HA left is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. A^- is 0.00025. So that part is correct.

So the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) )= 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So the log is correct. So pH is 4.25, which is close to 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another approach: in the diluted solution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid. Let me think about the pH at that point. But no, the question is about after adding NaOH, so the buffer step.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up with the volume. Let me see: initial solution is 40 cm³, adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH.

Wait, 20 + 20 is 40, correct. Then adding 2.5, so 42.5 cm³. So volumes are correct.

Hmm, so the pH at 25% is approximately 4.25. So looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But wait, wait another thought: what about activity coefficients and such? Probably, we can ignore that in a school problem, so Henderson-Hasselbalch should work.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution will be a solution of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) in water. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

So the concentration of acetate at equivalence point is moles of acetate / total volume.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles (same as initial moles of acetic acid).

Total volume at equivalence: initial 40 cm³ + NaOH volume of 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid. Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is small, we can approximate:

Kb ≈ x² / (0.02) → x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is about 3.29e-6 M. Then pOH is -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.49. So pH is 14 -5.49 ≈ 8.51. Hmm, that's about 8.51, which is close to option A's second value of 8.52.

But looking back at the options, option A says pH is 4.26 and 8.52. That seems to fit both.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that the pH at equivalence would perhaps be around 8.5. So in the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. But let me double-check my calculations for the equivalence point.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct. So the acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

The Kb expression is for CH3COO^-: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Since the concentration is 0.02 M, and x is small, the approximation holds.

So, Kb = x²/(0.02) → x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that.

Log(3.288) is about 0.517. So 3.288e-6 → pOH is 5.482. So pH is 14 -5.482 =8.518, approximately 8.52. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option A has 4.26 and 8.52. So that's matching both the 25% and equivalence point pH. But wait, wait. Let me look at the options again. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92, which is lower. Option C is 4.73 and 7.00. Hmm, but according to my calculations, the equivalence point is around 8.52, which matches option A.

But I also need to confirm the 25% titration calculation again. I came up with pH around 4.25, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake.

Wait, another way to approach the buffer solution is using the Henderson equation. Since the ratio is 1/3, the pH would be pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253. So about 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 as the first pH, which is very close. So the two calculated values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, another thought. When I diluted the acetic acid, I had 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. So 0.05 * 0.02 L (20 cm³) is 0.001 mol, correct. Then, diluting with 20 cm³ of water gives 40 cm³ total, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Right.

So, at 25% titration, we're adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Which neutralizes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate. So, in the solution, moles of CH3COOH are 0.00
