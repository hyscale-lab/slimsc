Okay, so I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I've heard that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly. 

The question says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, what's the stoichiometry here? I think EDTA typically forms a 1:1 complex with metal ions. So, one EDTA binds one Ca²+ ion. 

The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex. 

So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA. But because K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really low. 

Let me set up the equation. Let's assume that the concentration of the complex is C, which is 0.02 M. The reaction is: 
CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is given by [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = K. 

Wait, but wait, since the complex is 0.02 M, and it's in solution, the initial assumption is that the complex is fully formed, but a tiny amount dissociates. Let me denote x as the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So, x is the concentration of free Ca²+.

So, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because each mole of complex that dissociates releases one mole of each. And the concentration of the complex would be approximately 0.02 - x, but since x is very small compared to 0.02, we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M.

So, plugging into the K expression: 
K = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02.

We know K is 5e10. So,
x² = K * 0.02
x² = 5e10 * 0.02
Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 5e10 * 2e-2 = 5 * 2 =10; 10e8? Wait, 5e10 * 2e-2 = 5 * 2 * 1e10 * 1e-2 = 10 * 1e8 = 1e9.

So x² = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 31622.7766... → about 3.16e4 M? Wait, wait that can't be right because 3e4 is way higher than 0.02 M, which was the concentration of the complex. That would mean x is larger than the initial concentration of the complex, which isn't possible. So my initial assumption must be wrong.

Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let's think again. The K is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex is very stable. So, the dissociation would be minimal, so x should be much smaller than 0.02. Hmm, but according to that calculation, x is 3e4, which makes no sense. So I must have messed up the K expression.

Wait, maybe I confused the formation constant with the dissociation constant. Oh wait, the formation constant is Kf, which is the same as 1/Kd, where Kd is the dissociation constant. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) ) =5e10. So the dissociation constant Kd is 1/(5e10).

Wait, the problem states that KCa-EDTA is 5e10. I'm a bit confused whether KCa-EDTA is the formation constant or the dissociation constant. Since it's given as a large number, I think it's the formation constant. So the equation is correct.

So, let's re-express it. Kf = [Complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA]).

Wait, no, that's the correct expression. So Kf = [Complex]/([M][L]), where M is metal ion and L is ligand. So for the reaction, M + L ↔ ML.

So in this case
