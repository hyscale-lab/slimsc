Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Suppose E1 has a lifetime τ1, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, I think. Or wait, maybe each state's ΔE is the uncertainty in its own energy, so the difference ΔE must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two, or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, if ΔE is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the two states can be resolved.

Wait, let me get this straight. Each state has an uncertainty in energy proportional to 1/τ. So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Given that τ1 is 1e-9 seconds, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds. So τ2 is ten times longer than τ1. Therefore, ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1 because as τ increases, ΔE decreases.

Let me compute the ratio. τ2 = 1e-8 s, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So τ2 is 10 times larger. So ΔE2 would be ΔE1 multiplied by (τ1/τ2) = (1e-9)/(1e-8) ) = 0.1. So ΔE2 is 10% of ΔE1.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the energy difference ΔE that allows us to distinguish E1 and E2. So I need ΔE to be larger than some value. What's that value?

I think that for two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the two states might blend into each other, making it hard to resolve them.

Alternatively, sometimes the condition is that the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each individual state, but I'm not totally sure.

Wait, another approach: the broader the energy uncertainty (i.e., the larger the ΔE), the more the lines are spread out. So for the two states to be resolved, the separation between them (ΔE) must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties.

Wait, but if each state has its own ΔE, perhaps the sum is the relevant factor. So the minimal ΔE needed is when ΔE is greater than the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Because imagine both states have some spread, so their energy levels overlap unless the separation is larger than the sum of the spreads.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the maximum of the two uncertainties, but I'm not certain.

Let me compute the actual values.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But since the options are in eV, I should convert everything into eV.

Energy uncertainty ΔE = ħ / τ.

But I have to convert seconds to inverse energy, perhaps using the relation E = ħ * (1/τ) because E = ħ ν and τ is roughly 1/ν.

Wait, more precisely, E = ħ / τ because for a photon, E = h f, and f = 1/τ for a monochromatic source. So, yes, E ≈ ħ / τ.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

First, for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Wait, but I need to convert Joules to eV. I know that 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-25 J) / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV) ≈ (1.0545718e-25) / (1.602176634e-19) eV.

Calculating that: 1.0545718e-25 / 1.602176634e-19 = approximately 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, 1e-25 / 1e-19 is 1e-6. So 1.05e-25 / 1.6e-19 ≈ (1.05/1.6
