Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about determining the normalization constant 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but I remember that for a wave function to be valid, it must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. 

But wait, the problem states that all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. Oh right, because when they measured, none were found outside this region. So that probably means the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3. Or maybe the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3? Or perhaps the given wave function is only valid within that interval, and zero elsewhere. 

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and zero otherwise. But wait, that doesn't look right. Because the wave function can't have an imaginary component in that way. Oh wait, wait. The given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that suggests it's a complex function. But in reality, wave functions can be complex, but their modulus squared gives the probability density.

But normalization would require the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 to be 1. Oh wait, because outside this region, the wave function is zero, so the integral is only from 1 to 3.

So, let's write the wave function as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - (0.5)i. But wait, that's a real function minus an imaginary term. But that depends on the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{-0.5i...} but that's not what's written here.

Wait, the given expression is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me think. So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - (0.5)i. So, yes, it's a complex function. The modulus squared is |ψ|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5, so when you square the modulus, you add the squares of real and imaginary parts.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The modulus squared is ψ*ψ, where ψ* is the complex conjugate. So if ψ = A - Bi, then ψ* = A + Bi. So |ψ|^2 is (A)^2 + (B)^2.

So here, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is 0.5. So the modulus squared is [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx must equal 1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So ψ*ψ is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + [0.5]^2, because the cross terms would involve i and -i, which would cancel out. So yeah, |ψ|² = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral. It's the integral of a²/(1+x) plus 0.25, from 1 to 3.

First, separate the integral into two parts:

Integral (a²/(1+x) dx) from 1 to 3 + Integral (0.25 dx) from 1 to 3.

Compute each part.

The first integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Take square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer should be B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me make sure. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) multiplied by a complex exponential, but I think the way I approached it is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is purely real. Let me think again. The given function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave functions can be complex, but often in textbook problems, they are given as real functions. Hmm, but the way the question is set, the wave function is a complex number.

Wait, but perhaps the question has a typo. Let's see the original question again.

The wave function is ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i.

Yes, that's correct. So it's a complex function, so when we compute the modulus squared, we have to account for both real and imaginary parts.

Another thing: perhaps the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) * e^{-0.5i ... }, but in the problem statement, it's written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{iθ}, where θ is -0.5, perhaps? Because that would be a different way to write a complex wave function.

Wait, if the wave function were ψ = a/(sqrt(1+x)) * e^{-0.5i}, then ψ*ψ would be (a^2)/(1+x) because the exponential has modulus 1.

But that's not the same as the given expression. The given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i.

So ψ(x) is a complex function with real part a/sqrt(1+x) and imaginary part -0.5. So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but then the integral would be as I computed before. So the setup is correct.

So a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.7213.

a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Which is approximately 0.85, option B.

So the answer should be B.


To determine the normalization constant \( a \) for the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since the wave function is nonzero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral is split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]  
   Substituting, this becomes:  
   \[
   a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition is:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option is \( 0.85 \), so the numerical value of \( a \) is:

**Answer: B**
