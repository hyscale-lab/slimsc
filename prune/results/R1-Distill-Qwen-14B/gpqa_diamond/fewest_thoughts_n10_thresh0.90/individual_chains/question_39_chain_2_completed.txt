Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about quantum mechanics, specifically wave functions and normalization. Hmm. Alright, let's start by recalling what I know.

Each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait. The wave function for a particle is usually a complex number, which makes sense because it has a real and imaginary part. But in this case, the wave function is given as a real part (a over the square root of (1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Interesting.

The problem says that when measuring the position, none of the particles were found at x<1 or x>3. So the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. That must mean that the wave function is zero outside this region, but wait, the given wave function isn't zero outside. Oh wait, no, perhaps the wave function is such that the probability is zero outside. Hmm. Maybe the wave function isn't zero but the probability density |ψ|² is zero.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Let me write that down:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - (0.5)i

So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, but for the probability density, |ψ|² is ψ*ψ. So that would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) by its complex conjugate (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i), you get [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, the problem states that when measuring, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So the probability of finding the particle outside this region is zero. That implies that the wave function must be zero outside, but the given ψ is not zero except possibly at certain points.

Wait, that's a problem. Because in the given ψ, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), which depends on x. The imaginary part is a constant (-0.5i). Hmm, but if the wave function is non-zero outside of x=1 to x=3, but the probability is zero there, that would require that |ψ|² is zero outside. But how?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the wave function is only defined between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Or perhaps the given ψ is valid only in the region where the particle can be found, which is x between 1 and 3.

Wait, the question says, "in a part of space where it can exist." So the given wave function is valid only where the particle can exist, which is x between 1 and 3. So the wave function is zero outside of that region, and the given expression is for x in [1,3].

So we can model the wave function as:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3,
and ψ(x)=0 otherwise.

But wait, I'm not sure if the wave function is zero outside, because the given expression is for the region where the particle exists. The problem says, "the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So for the region where it can exist (x=1 to x=3), ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The wave function is zero elsewhere.

But wait, no. Because the wave function outside is zero, but the given wave function in the region is non-zero. So the total wave function would be a piecewise function.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave functions must be continuous and differentiable, except possibly at boundaries. But in this case, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for x in [1,3], and zero otherwise. At x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero? Or does it just abruptly become zero?

Wait, that's conflicting because at x=1, the given ψ is (a/sqrt(2)) -0.5i. If the wave function is zero beyond that, there's a discontinuity. That's not typical for a wave function, which usually is smooth except at boundaries for infinite potential wells or something.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is only valid in the region where the particle can exist, so it's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, but the form is as given. So the entire wave function is ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but that would mean that at x=1, ψ(1) is a/sqrt(2) -0.5i. And at x=3, ψ(3) is a/sqrt(4) -0.5i = a/(2) -0.5i. If the wave function is zero outside, then there's a jump from a non-zero value to zero. That's not a smooth function, but perhaps it's acceptable for this problem.

But I think the main point here is to normalize the wave function. Because in quantum mechanics, the integral of the probability density |ψ|² over all space must be 1.

So the normalization condition is:

Integral (from x=-infty to infty) |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Since ψ is zero outside [1,3], the integral reduces to the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So, |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ].

So the integral becomes:

∫ from 1 to 3 [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

Breaking it into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 plus integral [0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

First integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

So a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Then a = sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

The integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3:

The integral is a² * ln(1+x) from 1 to 3.

Which is a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

So yes, that's correct.

The integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So equation: a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202 → a ≈ 0.8485 → 0.85.

Yes, so the correct answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3,
\]

and \( \psi(x) = 0 \) elsewhere. The normalization condition for the wave function requires that:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Since \( \psi(x) = 0 \) outside the interval \( [1, 3] \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

The probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1 + x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1 + x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( a = 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
