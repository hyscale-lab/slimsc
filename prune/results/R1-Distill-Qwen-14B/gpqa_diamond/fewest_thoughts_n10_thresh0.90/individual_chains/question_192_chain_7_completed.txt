Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, I remember that conductors have some specific properties regarding electric fields and charges.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center because it's separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. 

The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so I should probably visualize this. There's a big sphere (conductor) with a cavity inside. The cavity is off-center, so the centers are separated by s. The charge q is inside the cavity. Point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field there is what we're after.

I remember that conductors in electrostatic equilibrium have some key properties. The charges inside the conductor move freely. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so initially, it has no net charge. But then, when we place a charge inside the cavity, does that change things?

Oh right! When you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface gets an induced charge. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q, because the conductor must remain neutral overall.

But wait, the cavity isn't at the center, so the induced charges won't be symmetrically distributed, right? Or does that matter? Hmm. Because the point P is outside the conductor, so the field there would depend on the outer surface charge, perhaps. Wait, the outer surface's charge distribution might not affect the field inside the conductor, but the field outside depends only on the total enclosed charge within a Gaussian surface.

Wait, let's think about Gauss's Law. For a point outside the conductor (so outside radius R), the Gaussian surface would enclose the entire conductor. The total charge enclosed would be the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. Because the conductor was initially uncharged and we added +q inside the cavity, so the inner surface has -q and the outer has +q, sum to +q in total.

So the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because for any spherical symmetry, the electric field outside depends only on the total enclosed charge. Wait, but in this case, the setup isn't symmetrical because the cavity is off-center. So does that affect the field outside?

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a conductor; the charges rearrange themselves to cancel any internal fields. The field inside the conductor (but outside the cavity) is zero. So the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces would adjust in such a way that the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetric, regardless of where the cavity is. Because the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution, making the external field as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, yes. So regardless of where the cavity is placed inside, the outer surface of the conductor would still have a symmetric charge distribution. Because of this, the electric field outside the conductor (at point P) would be as if all the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is outside, so the distance from the center of the conductor is L. So according to Coulomb's law, the electric field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but let me double-check. The presence of the cavity's position (s and theta) doesn't affect the external field because the conductor's outer surface has a symmetric distribution. So the external field is due to the total charge +q at the center, regardless of where inside the cavity the charge is placed.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, with $l, L > R$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

To solve this, we use the properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium and Gauss's law. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge of $-q$, and the outer surface of the conductor induces a charge of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality. The outer surface charge distribution is symmetric because the conductor is spherical, regardless of the off-center position of the cavity.

For a point $P$ outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that includes the conductor. The total enclosed charge is $+q$, and the field outside the conductor is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

The positions and angles related to the cavity (e.g., $s$, $l$, and $\theta$) do not affect the external field because the conductor's outer surface ensures a symmetric charge distribution. Thus, the correct answer is:

**B) $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$.**

Answer: B
