Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with such questions, it's all about breaking down the target molecule and figuring out the steps needed to get there.

The target compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me try to visualize that structure. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it, there's a carbaldehyde group — that's the aldehyde (CHO) attached to a carbon. Also, on the same carbon as the aldehyde, there's a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (so a -CH(OH)-cyclohexane part maybe? Or wait, maybe the structure is that the cyclohexane has a substituent which is a methyl group connected to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group? Hmm, maybe more accurately, the substituent is a -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part.

Wait, let me draw it out mentally. The main ring is cyclohexane. On carbon 1 of this ring, there's a substituent: a methyl group (CH2-) which is connected to a hydroxyl group (OH) and another cyclohexyl group (so like -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)). Additionally, on that same carbon, there's a carbaldehyde group. Wait, no, that can't be right because you can't have multiple substituents on a single carbon without branching. Oh wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group that has both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached, and also is connected to an aldehyde group. Or perhaps it's a branching: the substituent is a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane, and that methyl has two substituents — a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane group. Then, the same carbon as the substituent has the aldehyde group. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group. That methyl group is attached to a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane ring, and also is attached to an aldehyde group. So, the structure would be something like cyclohexane with a CH2-CHOH-cyclohexyl-CHO group attached? Or wait, perhaps it's more like (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring where one of the positions is attached to a methyl group, which itself is connected to a hydroxyl group (so, a hydroxymethyl group) and a cyclohexyl group. Additionally, the same methyl group is attached to a formyl group (CHO), making it a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with the substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is at position 1. So, the substituent is a group that's a methyl which is connected to another cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group, and also the methyl is attached to the aldehyde group.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the target as (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring, and the same carbon also has a formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a CH2 group that's connected to a hydroxyl group (so, CH(OH)), and also to another cyclohexane ring (so, making it a cyclohexyl group attached). Also, the same CH2 group is attached to an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group attached at position 1. That CH2 is connected to a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexane ring, and an aldehyde group. So, the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and also the aldehyde is attached to the same carbon.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is a cyclohexane ring where at position 1, there's a methyl group attached. That methyl group is connected to a hydroxyl group (so CH2OH), another cyclohexane ring (so, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to the methyl), and also an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the target molecule as having two cyclohexane rings connected via a CH2 group that also has an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So, the molecule is:

Aldehyde group (CHO) connected to a CH2 group, which is attached to a hydroxyl (OH), another cyclohexane ring, and the main cyclohexane ring.

So, to make this, I need to figure out the reaction steps starting from ethynylcyclohexane.

Ethylnylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH group.

I think the plan is to convert this into a compound that eventually becomes the target. Let's think about what reactions can do what.

The target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps oxidation of a suitable alcohol or alkyne?

Wait, possible steps to consider:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane probably needs to be functionalized. Maybe via hydroboration or some addition to the triple bond.

Wait, but let me think about the target. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)(CHO) group.
