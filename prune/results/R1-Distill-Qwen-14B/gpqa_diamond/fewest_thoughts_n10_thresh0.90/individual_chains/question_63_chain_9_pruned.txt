Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is asking about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should remember what the quantum rotation-vibration model entails. I think it combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would probably involve either an increase in vibrational or rotational quantum numbers, or maybe both. But wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy," which probably means the next energy level, not necessarily the next in one specific mode.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, the quantum rotation-vibration model... Oh, right, for diatomic molecules, the rotation and vibration are treated as separate modes. So the energy levels come from both rotation and vibration.

In the quantum mechanical model, the energy levels for rotation are quantized and given by E_rot = B * J*(J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. For vibration, the energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

The fundamental state would be the lowest in both rotation and vibration. So the vibrational state is n=0 (ground state) and the rotational state is J=0 (ground state). So the molecule is in the state with n=0 and J=0.

The problem asks what photon momentum is needed to switch to the next state. I'm a bit confused about what the "next state" refers to. Does it mean the next higher energy state overall, which could be either a vibrational or rotational change? Or is it considering a transition that involves both modes?

Wait, in spectroscopy, transitions can be either vibrational or rotational. But the next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the first excited state, which would involve the smallest possible energy increment. That would likely be a change in the vibrational state, or a change in the rotational state, whichever requires a lower energy.

Wait, the energy difference for a vibrational transition is h w, since the vibrational energy levels are spaced by h w. For rotational transitions, the energy difference between J and J+1 is 2B (J+1), but I'm not too sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, the energy difference between adjacent rotational states is 2B (since E_rot for J is B*(J(J+1)), so from J to J+1, the difference is B*( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) = B*(2J+2) = 2B(J+1). But for J=0, the difference is 2B(1) = 2B.

So I need to compare the energy required for a vibrational transition (h w) with a rotational transition (2B), and see which is smaller. Then, the photon would have to provide that energy.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, so n=0, J=0. The next state could be either n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). So which transition requires less energy?

Let me calculate both energies.

First, the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy when n=0 is (0 + 1/2) h w, and for n=1 it's (1 + 1/2) h w. So the difference is h w.

Now the rotational energy difference. For J=0, E_rot = B * 0*(0+1) = 0. For J=1, E_rot = B*(1*2) = 2B. So the difference is 2B.

So which is smaller: h w or 2B? Let me find out.

But wait, I don't have B, the rotational constant. How can I compute it?

The rotational constant B is given by B = (h) / (8 π² μ R²), where μ is the reduced mass of the molecule, and R is the bond length.

Let me compute μ first. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert that into kilograms because the formula uses SI units. 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

Now, R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

Now compute B:

B = h / (8 π² μ R² )

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.6260
