Okay, so I've got this question here about a diatomic molecule modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The elements are X and Y, with masses 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model... Right, I remember that in such a model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which I think is the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state. But wait, what's the next state? The next state would be the first excited state, which could involve either a change in rotation, vibration, or both. But since the question asks for the "lowest possible energy," I think it's the smallest possible energy increment. That usually corresponds to the transition that requires the least energy. 

In the quantum harmonic oscillator model (vibrational), the energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2) ħω. So the fundamental state is n=0, and the first excited state is n=1. The energy difference ΔE for vibration would be ħω. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, sometimes the energy also includes the rotational part. Oh right, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. Photons carry momentum p = E/c, since E = pc for photons. So the key is to find the energy difference between the initial and final states and then find p from that.

Wait, but what's the initial state? The fundamental state. The fundamental state in rotation-vibration is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). Or wait, J can't be zero for a diatomic because for a rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0, but the non-rigid model... Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the minimum vibrational state and the first rotational state or something else.

Wait, no, the fundamental state is the state with the lowest possible energy, which is the ground state for both vibration and rotation. So n=0 (vibrational ground state) and J=0 (rotational ground state). The next state would be the next available state, which could be either increasing J by 1 (so J=1) or increasing n by 1 (v=1). But which transition requires less energy? The vibrational transition involves a larger energy jump because the vibrational energy levels are spaced by ħω, which is higher than the rotational spacing.

Wait, let's calculate the energy differences. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħω. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant.

What's B? B is ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², and μ is the reduced mass.

So, μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So I = μ R² = (3.015e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s. So B = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.206e-46 )

Calculating numerator: (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68. Denominator: 2.412e-46. So B ≈ 1.1e-68 / 2.412e-46 ≈ 4.56e-23 J.

Wait, that seems really small. Alternatively, maybe I should express B in cm^-1 or something else. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute B.

Alternatively, the rotational energy level is given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is in units of cm^-1. But I might need to compute B in terms of energy.

Wait, another approach: the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I via B = h/(8π² c I), where c is the speed of light. Wait, no, that's the relation for the rotational constant in spectroscopy, where B is expressed in wavenumbers. Alternatively, the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is in Joules.

Alternatively, let's think about the energy levels. The ground state is J=0 (v=0), so E_initial = E_rot (J=0) + E_vib (n=0) = 0 + (1/2) ħ ω.

Wait no, the vibrational ground state is (n=0), so E_vib = (1/2) ħ ω. The rotational energy for J=0 is zero.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state, then initial energy is E_initial = E_vib (0) + E_rot (0) = (1/2) ħ ω + 0 = (1/2) ħ ω.

The next state could be either the first vibrational excited state (n=1) or the first rotational state (J=1). Which has a lower energy difference?

ΔE_vib = E_vib (1) - E_vib (0) = ( (3/2) ħ ω ) - (1/2 ħ ω ) = ħ ω.

ΔE_rot = E_rot (J=1) - E_rot (J=0) = B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2 B.

So which is smaller, ħ ω or 2 B? Let's compute both.

Given ω = 4e14 rad/s. So ħ ω = (1.0545718e-34 J s) *4e14 rad/s = approximately 4.218e-20 J.

Now 2 B: B is the rotational constant in Joules. Earlier, when I tried to compute B, I got about 4.56e-23 J. So 2 B is about 9.12e-23 J.

Comparing the two energy differences: ΔE_vib is about 4.2e-20 J, and ΔE_rot is 9e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon that allows it to transition via rotation. So the photon's energy should correspond to the rotational transition, which is smaller.

Wait, but wait. The question says the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which probably includes both rotational and vibrational contributions. But in the fundamental state, which is the lowest, so the next available state would be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. The transition with the lower energy is the rotational one, so the photon should have this energy.

Therefore, the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE_rot = 2 B.

Wait, but B is 4.56e-23 J, so E_photon = 2 * 4.56e-23 = 9.12e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, what's the exact value of B? Let me recalculate B correctly.

Moment of inertia I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute:

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = (3.016e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Rotational constant B = ħ²/(2 I).

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2064e-46) 

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.05e-34)^2 = 1.10e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So B = 1.10e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = approximately 4.56e-23 J.

Then 2B = 9.12e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.12e-23 J.

Momentum p = E_photon / c.

c is speed of light, approx 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.12e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.04e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Wait, that's way off. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait a second, perhaps I confused between B and the rotational energy. Oh wait, no, I think I might have messed up the calculation of B.

Wait another way: B is ħ²/(2 I), but perhaps I should compute it using the bond length in terms of the moment of inertia.

Wait, another approach: B is also given by (h^2)/(8 π² I c), but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of cm^-1 since rotational constants are often expressed that way.

Wait, no, let me think again. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2 I). So that part was correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is referring to the next state, which might involve both a change in rotation and vibration. But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy", which I think suggests the minimal energy change, so the rotational transition.

But maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the transition isn't just rotational. Maybe the molecule is in the ground state (J=0, v=0), and the next state is the first state available, which could be J=1, v=0. Alternatively, perhaps the next state is v=1, J=0.

Which transition requires less energy?

ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 9e-23 J.

ΔE_vib = ħω ≈ 4.2e-20 J.

So ΔE_rot is much smaller. So the photon should have energy 2B.

But then, when I compute p = E_photon / c = (9.12e-23 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 3.04e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are 1e-27 to 1e-28, which is several orders of magnitude higher.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

I have I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg → μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 3.016e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m → R^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

B = ħ^2/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2064e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.4128e-46) = approx 4.61e-23 J.

So E_photon = 2 * B = 9.22e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Still, that's way smaller than the options given. So perhaps I'm missing a factor, or perhaps the question is not about the rotational transition but another one.

Wait, maybe the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor, and the vibrational energy is considered as a separate component. But in the quantum rotation-vibration model, perhaps the energy levels are a product of rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, perhaps the next state is the first vibrational excited state. So the energy difference would be much larger, but then the momentum would be higher, which might align with the options.

Wait, let me compute ΔE_vib.

ΔE_vib = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = approx 4.218e-20 J.

Then p = E_photon / c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. That's close.

But earlier, I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, but perhaps the model expects the vibrational transition. Because in some cases, the fundamental vibrational state is the main transition considered.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So which transition has the lower energy difference: rotation or vibration?

ΔE_rot is about 9e-23 J, which is about 22 times less than ΔE_vib (4.2e-20 J). So the rotational transition is much lower in energy. But according to my calculation, the momentum would be about 3e-31 kg m/s, which is way smaller than any of the options.

Wait, but the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. That's about 1e4 times larger than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing B. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the moment of inertia correctly. Wait, another approach: perhaps the moment of inertia I is μ R².

Wait, let me recompute:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg → so 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 kg = let's compute 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27.

1.81818 * 1.660539 ≈ about 3.016 kg.

Wait, no, no, wait, 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 is 3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms → 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = (3.016e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ²/(2 I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2064e-46) → Let me compute numerator and denominator.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2064e-46 = 2.4128e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

Then p = E_photon / c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but the options are way larger. So maybe I'm missing a factor of 1e4 or so.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Wait, perhaps the formula for B is in terms of cm^-1. Let me try another way.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is in Joules.

Alternatively, the rotational constant is often expressed in cm^-1, where B (cm^-1) = h / (8 π² c I), with h being Planck's constant.

Wait, let me compute B in cm^-1.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

I = 1.2064e-46 kg m² = 1.2064e-46 kg (m²) → but to convert to g cm², since I is often expressed in g cm².

1 kg = 1000 g, 1 m = 100 cm.

So 1 kg m² = 1000 g * (100 cm)^2 = 1e5 g cm².

So I = 1.2064e-46 kg m² = 1.2064e-46 * 1e5 g cm² = 1.2064e-41 g cm².

Wait, no, wait, 1 kg m² = (1 kg) * m² = (1000 g) * (100 cm)^2 = 1000 * 10000 cm² kg → wait, no, wait: 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 m = 100 cm. So 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 1e4 cm².

So 1 kg m² = 1000 g * 1e4 cm² = 1e7 g cm².

So I = 1.2064e-46 kg m² = 1.2064e-46 * 1e7 g cm² = 1.2064e-39 g cm².

Wait, no, wait: 1e-46 kg m² = 1e-46 * (kg) * (m²). Since 1 kg = 1e3 g, and 1 m² = 1e4 cm².

So I = 1.2064e-46 kg m² = 1.2064e-46 * (1e3 g) * (1e4 cm²) )= 1.2064e-46 * 1e7 g cm² = 1.2064e-39 g cm².

Now, B (in cm^-1) is h/(8 π² c I), where h is Planck constant, I in g cm².

h = 6.626e-34 J s = 6.626e-34 * (kg m²/s²) s = kg m²/s. But in terms of g cm² s^-1, since 1 J = 1 kg m²/s², and 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 m = 100 cm.

h = 6.626e-34 J s = 6.626e-34 * (kg m²/s²) s = kg m²/s.

Convert kg m² to g cm²: 1 kg m² = 1e3 g * (1e2 cm)^2 = 1e7 g cm².

So h = 6.626e-34 * 1e7 g cm²/s² * s = 6.626e-34 * 1e7 g cm²/s = 6.626e-27 g cm²/s.

So B (cm^-1) = h / (8 π² c I) → but I is in g cm².

So substituting the values:

h = 6.626e-34 J s = 6.626e-27 g cm²/s.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

I = 1.2064e-39 g cm².

So B = (6.626e-27 g cm²/s) / (8 * π² * 3e10 cm/s * 1.2064e-39 g cm²) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Denominator: 78.9568 * 3e10 * 1.2064e-39 = 78.9568 * 3e10 = 2.3687e12; 2.3687e12 * 1.2064e-39 = 2.3687e12 * 1.2064e-39 = approx 2.857e-27.

So denominator is 2.857e-27.

B = 6.626e-27 / 2.857e-27 ≈ approx 2.32 cm^-1.

Wait, that makes more sense. So B is about 2.32 cm^-1.

Wait, but how does this relate to energy? Because 1 cm^-1 in wavenumbers corresponds to E = hc * (cm^-1).

So E_rot (J=1) = B (cm^-1) * hc.

Wait, for J=1, the rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J + 1) = 2.32 * (1)(2) = 4.64 cm^-1.

Then E_rot = 4.64 cm^-1 * hc, where hc is approximately 1240 eV*Å, but let me compute it in Joules.

h = 6.626e-34 J s, c=3e8 m/s.

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

But 1 m = 1e10 Å, so hc = 1.9878e-25 J * 1e10 Å = 1.9878e-15 J * Å.

But wait, 1 cm^-1 is 0.01 m^-1, so E = (4.64 cm^-1) * hc.

Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, E = h c (wavenumber) = h c (cm^-1) * (1/100 m/cm) → no, let me think. Wavenumber is cm^-1, so E = h c (cm^-1) * (1/100 m) → no, actually, c in m/s, so E = h c (cm^-1) * (1 cm) = h c (cm^-1) * 0.01 m.

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

hc = 1240 eV·nm. But I want to compute this in Joules.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, 1 nm = 1e-9 m.

So hc = 1240 * 1.602e-19 J * 1e-9 m = 1240 * 1.602e-28 J m.

But 1240 * 1.602e-28 ≈ 1.985e-25 J m.

So hc ≈ 1.985e-25 J m.

E = wavenumber * hc.

Wavenumber is 4.64 cm^-1 = 4.64 / 100 m^-1 = 0.0464 m^-1.

E = 0.0464 m^-1 * 1.985e-25 J m = 0.0464 * 1.985e-25 = approx 9.17e-27 J.

Wait, but earlier calculation using B in J gave E_rot = 2B = 9.2e-23 J. Now using cm^-1, I get E_rot ≈ 9.17e-27 J. Which is different. I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute B in terms of Joules.

Alternatively, let's compute B in Joules using the value we found in cm^-1.

Since B = 2.32 cm^-1, which corresponds to E = hc * B.

So E_rot (J=1) = hc * 2.32 cm^-1.

Wait, hc = 1240 eV·nm. 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J.

So hc = 1240 * 1.6e-19 * 1e-9 J m = 1.984e-25 J m.

But wavenumber in cm^-
