Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star. Wait, no, actually, the RV method detects the star's movement towards and away from us, right? So the star moves in a small orbit around the barycenter, and that's what we observe as shifts in the spectral lines.

The problem says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, same star masses, same planet masses. Interesting.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Wait, but orbital period—so we're looking for P2/P1. I'm trying to remember the formula related to the RV method. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 year in seconds) ) ] * [ (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) ]

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula more accurately. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the distance of the planet from the star (semi-major axis), and the orbital period.

I remember the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I got that a bit mixed up. Another approach: the formula that connects the RV semi-amplitude K with the orbital parameters.

Wait, let me think about Kepler's third law here. The orbital period P depends on the semi-major axis a and the mass of the star. But since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planet masses are similar (so M_p << M_*, I can probably ignore M_p in the denominator. Because M_p is Neptune mass, which is much smaller than the Sun, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G M_*) a³. So P is proportional to a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_*). But since M_* is the same for both stars, P is proportional to a^(3/2).

But wait, the RV method gives us K, the velocity semi-amplitude. So K is related to the star's velocity, which in turn depends on the planet's orbit. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) * (P/(2π)) ) ]^(1/3) * [ 1 / (c) ]

Wait, perhaps another way. The formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_Jup) ) ) * ( (a / (1 AU)) )^(-1) ) * ( (M_* / M_sun) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I should find the relation between K, a, and P. Let's think about the formula:

K is given by (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) c )

Wait, perhaps I should look at the expression for K in terms of a and P.

Because the star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital speed. The planet's speed around the star is v_p = (2π a) / P. Since the star and planet orbit the barycenter, their speeds are inversely proportional to their masses. So K = (M_p / M_*) * v_p.

So, K = (M_p / M_*) * (2π a / P).

But since M_p << M_*, M_p / M_* is small, but in this case, both planets have similar masses, so maybe the ratio can be considered as a constant. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to relate K and a.

Wait, from Kepler's law: P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_*)

So, a³ = (G M_* P²)/(4 π²)

We can substitute a into the K equation.

K = (M_p / M_*) * (2 π a ) / P

Substituting a from Kepler's law:

a = [ (G M_* P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

So,

K = (M_p / M_*) * (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_* P²/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute this step by step.

Let me write all the terms:

K = (M_p / M_*) * (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_* P²/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute the exponents.

First, the term inside the cube root is:

( G M_* P² ) / (4 π² )

So the cube root is [G M_* P² / (4 π²)]^(1/3) = (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) / (4 π²)^(1/3)

Now, putting it all together:

K = (M_p / M_*) * (2 π / P ) * (G M_* )^(1/3) P^(2/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3)

Simplify the terms:

Let me compute each part:

( M_p / M_* ) remains as is.

(2 π / P ) is 2 π P^(-1)

Then, the cube root part is:

(G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

So, putting all together:

K = (M_p / M_*) * 2 π * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) P ) ]

Wait, wait, let me compute the denominators correctly. The denominator is (4 π² )^(1/3) * P.

So, the denominator is [4 π² ]^(1/3) * P.

So, combining the terms:

K = (M_p / M_*) * 2 π * (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) * P ]

Simplify the constants:

Let me compute the constants separately.

2 π / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

Let me compute (4 π² )^(1/3 ) = (4)^(1/3) * (π² )^(1/3 ) = 4^(1/3) * π^(2/3 )

So,

2 π / [4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ] = 2 π * 4^(-1/3) π^(-2/3 )

Simplify 2 * 4^(-1/3) = 2 / (4^(1/3)) ) = 2 / (2^(2/3) ) ) = 2^(1) / 2^(2/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3 )

And π^(1 - 2/3) ) = π^(1/3 )

So the constants multiply to 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3 )

Wait, wait, let me recheck:

Wait, 2 π divided by [4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ]

So, 2 π / [ (4^(1/3) ) * (π^(2/3) ) ) ]

Which is 2 * (π ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) )

= 2 / (4^(1/3) ) ) * ( π^(1) / π^(2/3) )

= 2 * 4^(-1/3) ) * π^(1 - 2/3 )

= 2 * (2^2 )^(-1/3 ) ) * π^(1/3 )

Simplify 4^(1/3 ) is (2^2 )^(1/3 )= 2^(2/3 ), so 4^(-1/3 ) is 2^(-2/3 )

So 2 * 2^(-2/3 ) = 2^(1 - 2/3 ) ) = 2^(1/3 )

And π^(1 - 2/3 ) = π^(1/3 )

So the constants become 2^(1/3 ) * π^(1/3 )

Now, putting it all together:

K = (M_p / M_*) * 2^(1/3) π^(1/3 ) * (G M_* )^(1/3 ) * P^(2/3) / P

Wait, wait, the P terms: P^(2/3 ) / P = P^(-1/3 )

So,

K = (M_p / M_*) * (2 π )^(1/3 ) * (G M_* )^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )

Wait, perhaps I should write (2 pi)^(1/3) as (2 pi )^(1/3 ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor exponents more clearly.

Let me rewrite all the terms:

K = (M_p / M_*) * [ 2^(1/3) ] * [ π^(1/3) ] * [ G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) ) ] * P^(-1/3 )

Combine the constants:

2^(1/3 ) * π^(1/3 ) = (2 π )^(1/3 )

So,

K = (M_p / M_* ) * ( 2 π G )^(1/3 ) * ( M_* )^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )

Simplify the M_* terms:

(M_p / M_* ) * M_*^(1/3 ) = M_p * M_*^(-2/3 )

So,

K = M_p * M_*^(-2/3 ) * (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the exponents:

K = [ (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M_p * M_*^(-2/3 ) ] * P^(-1/3 )

Alternatively,

K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3 ) M_p / M_*^(2/3 )) ) * P^(-1/3 )

So, K is proportional to M_p / ( M_*^(2/3 ) ) * P^(-1/3 )

But since M_* is the same for both stars, and M_p is same for both planets (same mass as Neptune), M_p and M_* are constants. So for both Planet #1 and Planet #2, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 )

Wait, that's a key point. Because if K ∝ P^(-1/3 ), then P ∝ K^(-3 )

Because if K = C * P^(-1/3 ), where C is a constant, then P = (C / K )^3.

Wait, because solving for P:

K = C * P^(-1/3 )

=> P^(-1/3 ) = K / C

=> P^(1/3 ) = C / K

=> P = (C / K )^3 = ( C^3 ) / K^3 )

So, P ∝ (1/K )^3 → P ∝ K^(-3 )

Wait, so higher K means smaller P.

So, if Planet #2 has a larger K (7 milliangstrom vs. 5), then Planet #2 has a shorter period. Wait, but the question is asking how much longer is P2 than P1.

So, if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1.

Wait, but let me think again.

Another approach: since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), then P is proportional to (1/K )^3.

So, P2 / P1 = ( (1/K2 ) / (1/K1) )^3 = (K1 / K2 )^3.

Because P ∝ 1/K^3, so P2/P1 = (K1/K2 )^3.

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then K1/K2 is less than 1, so the ratio (K1/K2 )^3 is less than 1, meaning P2 is smaller than P1.

But wait, wait, let me double-check.

Let me define P1 and K1 for Planet #1, and P2 and K2 for Planet #2.

Since K ∝ P^(-1/3 ), then K1 = A * P1^(-1/3 )

Similarly, K2 = A * P2^(-1/3 )

Dividing the two equations:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So, (P2 / P1 ) = ( K1 / K2 )^3

Thus, P2 = P1 * ( K1 / K2 )^3

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2 )^3.

In this problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7 milliangstrom.

So K1 =5, K2=7.

So, K1/K2 =5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So, (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2/P1 = 0.364. So, the period of Planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of Planet #1.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio is 0.364 times, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1.

So, the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check. Another way to think: the larger the K (wider Doppler shift), the smaller the period because the star is moving more quickly, meaning the planet is orbiting more closely, leading to a shorter period. So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 is smaller than P1.

So P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's shorter, meaning the period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1, so it's about 36% of P1.

So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1, which is 0.36 times longer. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, no. If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is shorter. So the question is, how long is P2 compared to P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which is about 0.36 times as long. So planet 2 has a shorter period.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So option A is 0.36, which is the ratio P2/P1.

So the answer is option A, approximately 0.36 times as long.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I derived the formula, I thought K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), which leads to P proportional to (1/K )^3.

So P2 = (K1/K2 )^3 * P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2 )^3.

Which is (5/7 )^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1, meaning it's about 36% of P1's period. So P2 is shorter, so the period is shorter, so it's about 0.36 times as long as P1.

So the answer is A, approximately 0.36 times.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). This implies \( P \propto K^{-3} \), meaning the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the RV semi-amplitude.

Given:
- Planet #1 has an RV semi-amplitude \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \),
- Planet #2 has an RV semi-amplitude \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \),

the ratio of the orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting the values of \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1, meaning it is about 36% as long as Planet #1's orbital period.

From the options provided:
- **A) ~0.36**: Correct, as calculated above.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as this would imply a longer period for Planet #2, which contradicts the relationship \( P \propto K^{-3} \).
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as this would imply an even longer period for Planet #2, which is inconsistent with the data.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as this does not match the calculated ratio.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
