Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, same ratio for radius and mass. 

The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Wait, the peak wavelength for each star is the same. Hmm, I remember from blackbody radiation that the peak wavelength is related to the temperature. The formula is Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because λ is inversely proportional to T.

So, same temperature. That's an important point. Now, the luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars have the same T, the luminosity depends on R². 

Wait, let me make sure. Stefan-Boltzmann says L = 4πR² σ T^4, right? So since both have same T, L is proportional to R squared. 

So, Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Then the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1^2)/(R2^2) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would suggest the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. 

But wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Oh right, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Do I need to consider Doppler shift here? Because the observed wavelength could be affected by the star's motion. 

Wait, the peak wavelengths they determined were the same. Oh, but wait—did they measure the wavelengths as emitted, or the observed wavelengths due to Doppler shift? Because if a star is moving, its emitted light is shifted. So if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its observed peak wavelength might be different. 

The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So this would be the observed wavelengths. So if Star_2 is moving, its emitted wavelength is shifted. So we need to calculate the actual temperature of each star based on their velocities. 

Wait, let me think. Let's denote Star_1 as S1 and Star_2 as S2. S1 has radial velocity v1 = 0, so no Doppler shift. S2 has v2 = 700 km/s. But the observed λ_max for both are the same. 

The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ) but wait, that's for relativistic speeds, but 700 km/s is about
