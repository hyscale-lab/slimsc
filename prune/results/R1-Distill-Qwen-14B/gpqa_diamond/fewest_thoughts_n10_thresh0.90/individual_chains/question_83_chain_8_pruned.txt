Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay, so first, I need to figure out what happens when the acetic acid is diluted. Then, during titration, how much NaOH is added, and what the pH is at 25% and equivalence point.

Let me start by calculating the initial concentration after dilution. Acetic acid is diluted by adding equal volumes of water. So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³, making the total volume 40 cm³.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be concentration multiplied by volume. The volume in liters is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Diluting it with 20 cm³ gives a new volume of 40 cm³. So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, no, wait. 0.02 L is 20 cm³, so 20 + 20 is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 mol. So at equivalence point, we need 0.001 mol of NaOH. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Let me confirm: 25% means 1/4 of the equivalence point volume, which would be 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the moles of acetic acid were 0.001, after adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, we have 0.00075 mol of CH3COOH left and 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^- formed.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, producing a mole of acetate.

So for each scenario, I'll need to calculate the pH.

First, the 25% titration point.

At this point, we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([
