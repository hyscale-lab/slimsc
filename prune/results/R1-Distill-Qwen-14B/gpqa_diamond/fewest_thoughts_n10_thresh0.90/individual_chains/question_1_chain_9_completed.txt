Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve them, the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So ΔE_diff = |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is that the energy resolution required is ΔE_res ≈ ħ/(Δt), where Δt is the time over which the measurement is made. But since the states have different lifetimes, perhaps the measurement time is related to the shorter lifetime? Or maybe it's the longer one? Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the given data. The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 sec, τ2 = 1e-8 sec. So τ2 is longer than τ1. So the energy uncertainty for E1 is ħ/τ1, which is larger than ħ/τ2 because τ1 is smaller.

Wait, but let's compute the uncertainties. Let's calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Compute ΔE1 = ħ / τ1.

But what's the value of ħ in eV·s? I remember that 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules, and ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So let's convert ħ to eV·s.

1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 1 J = 1/(1.6e-19) eV. So ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.6e-19 J) ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.59e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.59e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.59e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = 6.59e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.59e-8 eV.

Wait, that's 6.59e-7 eV for ΔE1 and 6.59e-8 eV for ΔE2.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the difference between E1 and E2. So to distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is less than the sum, then their uncertainties might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So ΔE_diff must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Adding the two uncertainties:

ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.59e-7 + 6.59e-8 ≈ 7.25e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than ~7.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 7e-7. So not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → Even smaller, worse.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 which is 1e4 times larger than 7e-7. So yes, this would be much larger than the required sum. So this would suffice.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is about 14 times smaller than 7e-7 eV. So not enough.

Wait, wait, but wait. Another thought: When you have two states, each with their own energy uncertainty, the minimal detectable difference in energy is on the order of the sum of the uncertainties. So, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties.

So the options are:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 7e-7 eV. So that would work.

Other options are too small.

Wait, but the problem says "could be their energy difference" so that they can be clearly resolved. So the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Another approach: The energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty in energy for each state. The energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of each. So, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but the uncertainty is ΔE1 = 6.59e-7 eV and ΔE2 = 6.59e-8 eV. So the larger is ΔE1. So for the difference to be resolvable, it must be larger than ΔE1.

So in that case, any difference larger than 6.59e-7 eV would suffice. Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4, which is larger than 6.59e-7. So yes, that's acceptable.

But wait, the problem says the two states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2. So the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1, and E2 is ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

Wait, perhaps the combined uncertainty is ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because when you're measuring, you have to account for both uncertainties.

So if the difference is larger than both individual uncertainties, plus each other, then you can resolve them.

In that case, the difference should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 7.25e-7 eV.

Only option C meets that (1e-4 eV is larger than 7e-7).

Wait, but option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is way smaller than 7e-7 eV. So option C is the only one that's big enough.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

Here, the energy uncertainty for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.59 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). Substituting the lifetimes:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.59 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.59 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Adding the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} \) must be greater than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as it is much less than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** Also too small, even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \).
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** Sufficiently large, as \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much greater than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as it is about 14 times smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
