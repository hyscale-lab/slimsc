Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, none of the particles were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So I need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm. I remember that the wave function must be normalized, meaning the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. And since the particles aren't found outside x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside that interval, but wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Oh wait, maybe that's the wave function in the region where the particle exists, which is between 1 and 3. So the wave function is zero elsewhere, but in the region 1<=x<=3, it's given by that expression.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex function because of the 'i' term. But I thought that for a physically realizable wave function, it must be normalizable, and perhaps the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. But having a complex wave function is okay; the important thing is that the integral of the absolute square equals 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i, but this is valid only between x=1 and x=3. Outside that, ψ(x) is zero.

Now, the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=-infty to x=+infty must be 1. But since ψ(x) is zero outside [1,3], the integral reduces to the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) is a complex number, its magnitude squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because for a complex number a + ib, the square is a² + b². So |ψ|² is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Because ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = A + B i, where A = a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B = -0.5. Then |ψ|² is A² + B². So yes, that's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1.

Let's split that integral into two parts:
Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So this becomes a² [ ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) ] = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ].

Wait, wait: ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2), so ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫0.25 dx from 1 to3. That's 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute the numerical value.

Wait, what's ln(2) approximately? ln(2) is about 0.693147.

So 0.5 divided by 0.693147 is approximately 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213. Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Wait, let's redo it step by step.

Compute the integral of [a²/(1+x)+0.25] dx from 1 to3.

Integral becomes:

a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3: which is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Then ∫ 0.25 dx from1 to3: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So total integral: a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1. So a²= (0.5)/(ln2).

Compute 0.5/ ln2: 0.5 ≈ 0.5, ln2≈0.693147, so 0.5 /0.693147 ≈0.7213478.

Then a is sqrt(0.7213478), let me calculate that. sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the wave function. The given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So its magnitude squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2.

But wait, is that correct? Because if ψ(x) = A + Bi, then |ψ|^2 = (A^2 + B^2). But in this case, A is a function of x, and B is a constant. So the expression I used is correct.

So the integral becomes: ∫ (A^2 + B^2) dx.

Wait, but another way to think about this is that the wave function is complex, so it's already normalized. So the integral must sum to 1.

Therefore, the calculation I did earlier should be correct, leading a to be about 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function must be normalized. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and it is valid only in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \). Outside this region, \( \psi(x) = 0 \). The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since \( \psi(x) = 0 \) outside \( [1, 3] \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The magnitude squared of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Splitting the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right).
   \]

   Using \( \ln(4) = 2\ln(2) \), this simplifies to:

   \[
   a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining the results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
