Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star's properties are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. 

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 has 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. Now, the star's forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å shows shifts due to these planets. Planet1 causes a 0.03 Å shift, and Planet2 causes a 0.04 Å shift. Both shifts are periodic, so I think this relates to the Doppler method for detecting exoplanets.

Wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperatures. Oh, right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, the problem gives me information from the RV method and transit method. Oh, because the RV method gives the mass, and transit gives the radius. But for temperature, I need the distance from the star, which depends on the orbital period. But wait, I don't have the periods here directly. Or do I?

Wait, but the RV method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The Doppler shift relates to the star's velocity. So the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the distance of the planet from the star. So for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K can be used to find the planet's distance or period.

Wait, the formula for RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) ) * ( (sin i) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is 0, so (1 - e²)^(1/2) is 1. Also, since the planets are detected via RV, I guess their masses are such that M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) * sin i ) / a^(1/3)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital velocity around the star, but from the star's perspective, the velocity of the star is K. The actual formula, as I recall, is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )

But in the case where M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) )

But since e is 0, it's:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) ) / (2π )

But wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude for a circular orbit (e=0) is:

K = (v * (M_p) sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) a^(1/3)) ), but that's getting too vague. Maybe I should think about the relation between K and the period.

Wait, the period P is related to the semi-major axis a by Kepler's third law. For a star of mass M, the period is P² = (4π² a³) / (G (M + M_p)) ). Again, since M_p << M, this is approximately P² = (4π² a³) / (G M).

So, from RV, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) )

But perhaps more usefully, K is related to the velocity of the star, which is linked to the planet's orbital velocity. The star's velocity is K, and the planet's velocity is higher because the planet's mass is much smaller. Hmm, but perhaps using the fact that K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the RV method gives the mass of the planet in terms of the semi-amplitude K. The formula is:

M_p sin i = (K * (M_star) ) / ( (2943) ) * (P / (2π)) )^(1/3)

Wait, but this might be getting too complicated. Let me think of the problem again.

The question gives the Doppler shifts for each planet on the same forbidden line. So the shifts are due to the Doppler effect caused by the star's velocity moving towards or away from us. The shift is inversely proportional to the wavelength, right? The formula for Doppler shift is:

Δλ / λ = v_r / c

But in this case, the shifts are given in terms of Ångströms. So for each planet, the maximum shift (semi-amplitude K) is given as 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The star's line is at 6300 Å, so the fractional shift is (0.03 /6300) and (0.04/6300).

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star along our line of sight. So for each planet, K1 = 0.03 Å / 6300 Å * c, where c is the speed of light. Let me compute that.

But wait, I think the formula is:

v_r = (Δλ / λ) * c

So for Planet1: v_r1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.

Similarly, v_r2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

But the star's velocity due to Planet1 is 0.03/6300 * c, and for Planet2, it's 0.04/6300 * c.

Wait, but this gives the velocity semi-amplitude K for each planet. Because the Doppler shift is periodic with the planet's orbital period, and the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star.

So, K is the same as the RV semi-amplitude for each planet. So K1 = (0.03 /6300) * c and K2 = (0.04 /6300) * c.

But wait, what is c? Speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s, but in terms of units, we can just keep it as c for now.

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since e=0, this simplifies to:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i ) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ]^(1/3) / (2π )

Wait, perhaps I should rearrange the formula to find the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes, a1 and a2.

Because the equilibrium temperature depends on (L/(16 π sigma a²)), so T_eq is proportional to sqrt(L/(a²)) ), and since L is the star's luminosity, which depends on its radius and effective temperature: L = 4 π R_star² sigma Teff^4.

So the equilibrium temperature T_eq for a planet is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )

Because L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4, so L/(16 pi sigma a^2) ) = [4 pi R^2 sigma T^4 ]/(16 pi sigma a^2) ) = (R^2 T^4)/(4 a^2) )^(1/4) )? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature when the planet is in a circular orbit and has no atmosphere (assuming blackbody) is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )

Yes, that's the formula I remember. So T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(a)). So the ratio of T1 to T2 would be sqrt( (R1/a1) / (R2/a2) ) ), but wait, R_star is the same for both planets, since they're orbiting the same star. So R1 = R2 = R_star.

Therefore, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) )

Because T_eq ∝ sqrt(1/a) for the same star.

So if I can find a1 and a2, I can compute the temperature ratio.

But how to find a1 and a2?

Since both planets are detected via RV, their K is given. And K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the semi-major axis.

The formula for K is:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * P) / (2 pi) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. I found another formula:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2 * pi * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since e=0, it's K = [ (G * M_p sin i ) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ]^(1/3) / (2 pi )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Let me think about the relation between K and a.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v_star) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Another way, P is the orbital period. So, for a given star, the K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star
