Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to prepare this solution and determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, right. So Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and we're adding a strong acid to it. The reaction between a hydroxide and a strong acid should form a salt and water, right?

First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with in moles. Because the acid is monobasic, the reaction would be straightforward. Let me jot down the formula.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, and OH is 17 g/mol. So for each OH group, it's 17, and since there are three, that's 3*17=51. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that more precisely. Iron's atomic weight is about 55.845, and each OH is 17.007. So three OHs would be 3*17.007 = 51.021. Adding the Fe, 55.845 +51.021=106.866 g/mol approximately.

So 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 divided by 106.866 g/mol. Let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.866 ≈ 0.0009358 mol, or 9.358e-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is Fe^3+ and OH^- ions. When it reacts with a strong acid, which is monobasic, probably HCl, H2SO4 would be dibasic but since it's monobasic, maybe HNO3? Wait, no, the acid is monobasic, so it provides one H+ per molecule. So the reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, but wait a second. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so it can accept protons. So in the presence of acid, each OH^- in Fe(OH)3 will react with H+ from the acid. Since Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, each OH would take one H+, so each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

So moles of H+ needed is 3 times moles of Fe(OH)3.

So moles of H+ = 3 * 9.358e-4 ≈ 0.0028075 mol.

The acid used is 0.1 M, monobasic. So the volume of acid (V) needed can be found using n = M * V. So V = n / M.

n is 0.0028075 mol, M is 0.1 mol/dm³ (since 100 cm³ is 0.1 dm³, but wait, here the volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L or 100 mL, which is 0.1 L. Wait, 100 cm³ is 0.1 L, yes. So the acid's concentration is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/L.

So V = 0.0028075 /
