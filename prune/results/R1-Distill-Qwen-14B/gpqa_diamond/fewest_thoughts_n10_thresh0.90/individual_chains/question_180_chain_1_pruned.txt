Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem states: We've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible for all of them. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, so I think this is about calculating the potential energy in an electrostatic setup. Since all the charges are the same, I should be considering the interactions between each pair.

Wait, but wait—potential energy between charges, right? The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, when you have multiple charges, how does that work?

Oh right, for a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But since the charges are identical, I can calculate the energy for one pair and then multiply by the number of pairs.

Wait, but wait again. Are the charges free to move? No, twelve are fixed at 2 meters from P, and the thirteenth is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are all at the same distance from the 13th. So the interactions are between the fixed charge at P and each of the twelve charges at 2 m, and also between the twelve charges themselves?

Wait a minute, the question says the twelve are at 2 m from P. So the 13th is fixed at P, but the others are fixed at 2 m away. So I think the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the one at P will contribute, and also the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges, because they are identical and placed in a fixed configuration.

Wait, but wait, are the twelve charges arranged in some particular way, like a sphere around P? Because their arrangement might affect the potential energy between themselves. But the problem doesn't give any specifics about their positions relative to each other, only that they're each at 2 m from P. Oh, but wait, the problem says the 12 are each at 2 m from P, but nothing about their mutual distances. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the charges are arranged in such a way that the potential energy is minimized. For identical charges (all positive, because each is 2e), the minimum potential energy configuration would be when they are as far apart as possible. But if each is fixed at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other are not fixed—so they can move on a sphere of radius 2 m around P.

But considering that, the potential energy between the 12 charges would depend on their mutual distances. If they are all on a sphere, to minimize the potential energy, they would arrange themselves as far apart as possible, which is the case when they form a
