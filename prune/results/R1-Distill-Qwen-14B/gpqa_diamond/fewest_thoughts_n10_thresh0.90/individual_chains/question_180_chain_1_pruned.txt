Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle has a charge of 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about any kinetic energy from their movement or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So, point P is where one charge is fixed, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P.

The question asks for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electrostatic potential energy. So I need to calculate the potential energy between all these charges.

Wait, but waitâ€”since the charges are identical and all positive, they would repel each other. So the potential energy would be positive because bringing them together requires work. But the question is about the minimum energy. Hmm, but if they're constrained, maybe the system's energy is fixed? Oh, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the potential energy of the entire system as it is.

So, the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. For each pair of charges, the potential energy is (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since all the charges are the same, each q is 2e.

Wait, but let me clarify: each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from point P, where the 13th charge is fixed. So the 13th charge is fixed, so it doesn't move. The twelve are at fixed positions 2 m away from P. So, how are they arranged? Are they all at the same point 2 m from P, or are they placed symmetrically around P at a distance of 2 m?

Hmm, the problem says the twelve are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, maybe they form a spherical shell around P at radius 2 m. But wait, each of the twelve is at 2 m from P. So perhaps each of the twelve is at a distance of 2 m from P, but each of them is placed such that they
