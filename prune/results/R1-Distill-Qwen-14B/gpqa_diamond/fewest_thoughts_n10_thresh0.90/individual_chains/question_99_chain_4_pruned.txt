Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and two characterization techniques were used: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. The NMR has several signals, but none are from vinyl hydrogens. Also, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. The options are four different compounds, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I'll think about the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ probably indicates O-H stretching. Broad peaks in that region are typical for alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group. Now, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad because those protons are acidic and the hydrogen bonding causes the broadening. So the compound is likely a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it were an ester or ketone, the peaks would be different. Wait, but the FTIR also shows a strong peak at 1700, which aligns with a carbonyl group, so maybe a ketone or ester or acid. But the broad peak at 3000 is more indicative of -COOH because in carboxylic acids, both the O-H (broad) and the C=O (sharp around 1700) are present. So I think the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Now looking at the NMR information. The absence of vinyl protons means there are no double bonds or triple bonds, or any sp² hybridized carbons attached to protons. So the structure doesn't have any alkenes or alkynes. So all the carbons are probably either sp³ or maybe some other structures, but no vinylic Hs.

The NMR has some complex splitting. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that suggests that the protons are undergoing splitting from multiple neighboring groups. Let me think about splitting patterns.

Each split is due to neighboring protons. For example, a doublet is from one neighbor, a triplet from two, and so on. So a doublet of triplets would mean each proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons. Let's think: for a doublet of triplets, perhaps the proton is next to two groups. The first split (the doublet) could be from one neighbor, and each of those splits again into a triplet, making a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but in the first case, it's a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's getting more complex. So perhaps this proton is next to three different sets of neighboring protons. Let me think of a structure that would cause multiple splits.

Let me look at the options to see their structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

So, breaking that down, the structure is CH2COOH connected to CH(CH2CH3) (two of them). Wait, I'm not sure I'm getting that right. Let me write it out.

Actually, the formula is CH3–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–CH2–COOH.

So, the molecule is: CH3–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–CH2–COOH.

So the central part is two CH groups each attached to a C2H5 group. So the structure would be something like:

CH3–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–CH2–COOH.

Wait, that doesn’t quite make sense. Let me think again. Each of the central carbons has a methyl group, an ethyl group, and a hydrogen. So the structure is more like:

The backbone is CH2–COOH, connected to a central part which is two carbons, each connected to an ethyl group and a hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps it's a geminal arrangement. Each of the two central carbons has a CH group attached to ethyl and methyl groups?

Wait, perhaps the structure is better represented as:

The molecule is (CH2CH3)C–C(CH2CH3)–CH2–COOH
