Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix rho equal to (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. Since this is a density matrix, it's likely a mixed state because it's a convex combination of projectors.

Wait, wait. Let me write down the matrix form to get a better idea. The |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and zeros elsewhere, and similarly for |1><1|. Adding them together would give a diagonal matrix with ones in the (0,0) and (1,1) positions. Then multiplying by 1/2 would make each diagonal element 1/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

So it's a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. That makes sense because it's an equal mixture of the |0> and |1> states.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that refers to. I think it might be related to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right! For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector (r) is a way to represent the state, where the coordinates correspond to the components of the density matrix.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as:

rho = (I + r·σ)/2

Where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So expanding this, the density matrix becomes:

rho = (1/2) [ 
    [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
    [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]
]

Comparing this to the given rho matrix:

Given rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|), which in matrix form is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Let's write out the general rho using the r components:

rho = [[ (1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
        [ (r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

So, setting this equal to the given rho:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z =0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 =1/2 → same result, r_z=0.

Now, the off-diagonal terms: (r_x - i r_y)/2 must equal 0. So:

r_x - i r_y = 0 → both r_x and r_y must be zero. Because if r_x is non-zero, then r_y would have to be imaginary to cancel it, which isn't possible as r_x and r_y are real numbers.

So r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options:

Option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), with equal probabilities for each. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the general form of \(\rho\) is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\
r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we find:

1. From the diagonal terms:
   \[
   \frac{1 + r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \implies 1 + r_z = 1 \implies r_z = 0.
   \]
   Similarly, \(\frac{1 - r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\) also gives \(r_z = 0\).

2. From the off-diagonal terms:
   \[
   r_x - i r_y = 0.
   \]
   Since \(r_x\) and \(r_y\) are real numbers, this implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in qubit space. Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**.

Answer: C
