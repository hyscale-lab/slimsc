Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its NMR data and then predicting the product after a series of reactions.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Let me think about possible structures. The NMR data might help here.

Looking at the 1H-NMR data:
- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a pretty downfield shift; could be an aldehyde proton or maybe an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, so maybe that's it.
- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. This is in the aromatic region. Maybe para-substituted phenyl groups?
- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Also aromatic, perhaps another set of protons in a para-substituted ring.
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an OH group. But wait, 2H as a singlet and broad? Or maybe it's not hydroxyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or some other protons.
- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. This seems like a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, maybe an oxygen. Or perhaps part of an ether or ester group.

Wait, the molecular formula has an O and a N. So maybe there's an amide or something else. But looking at the options, the products are mostly aldehydes and have phenyl groups. So perhaps the original compound is a nitrile or an amine that's been converted.

Wait, the reactions: first is NaNO2 and HCl. That usually is a nitrosation reaction, typically used for aromatic amines to form diazonium salts. Then H2O, which might hydrolyze something. The third step is aqueous KOH and heat, which sounds like a hydrolysis, maybe under basic conditions.

Let me think about the initial structure. The NMR indicates some aromatic protons and a possible aldehyde. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Looking at the NMR: the triplet at 9.72 might be an aldehyde group. The two doublets around 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two para-substituted aromatic rings. For example, two phenyl groups attached to a chain. The 6.27 ppm could be a vinylic proton. Oh wait, but it's a broad singlet for 2H. Or maybe it's an -OCH2- group. The 3.66 ppm, doublet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like a diphenyl compound with a side chain. Let's think about the integration. There's 1H at 9.72, which could be part of a butenyl group. So maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. But wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. Formula: C8H9NO. For degrees of unsaturation, formula is CnHmOxNy. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is DoU = (2n +2 - m -x -y)/2. So n=8, m=9, x=1 (O), y=1 (N). So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18-11)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, I think the correct formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Because for each X (halogen) it's -1, but N is +1. Wait, no, perhaps it's (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X=0, C=8, H=9, N=1.

So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees: maybe two rings (from two benzene rings) and a double bond, or one ring and three double bonds, etc. Wait, benzene is three degrees. So two benzene rings would be 6 degrees. Hmm, but the compound has 5 degrees. So perhaps one benzene ring (3 degrees) and some other double bonds or rings.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, alternative formula: DoU = (2n +2 - m + a - b)/2, where a is nitrogens and b is halogens. Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Another approach: each ring or double bond is a DoU. For a molecule, each carbon contributes 2, each H doesn't. So for C8H9NO: number of hydrogens expected for a fully saturated molecule is 2*(8) +2 - (N and O effects? Maybe not. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute like this:

A general formula for hydrocarbons is CnH2n+2. Each DoU reduces the H count by 2. So for the given compound, the formula is C8H9NO.

So, the saturated formula would be C8H18 (since 2n+2 = 18 for n=8). The given H is 9, so missing H is 9. Missing H is 9, so DoU is (18 -9)/2 =4.5. But DoU must be integer. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the formula as C8H9NO. The molecular formula's degree of unsaturation can be calculated by: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, X=0 (no halogens), N=1. So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 â†’ (10)/2=5. So five degrees.

So, five degrees. Benzene has three, so if there's a benzene ring, that's three. Then maybe an aldehyde (which is a double bond) and another double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, a benzene and a ring or another double bond.

Let me think about the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde proton. Then, the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two para-substituted phenyl rings. Wait, a para-substituted ring's protons would be a doublet each. But in the case of two para-substituted rings, perhaps coupled with each other?

Wait, if there's a substituent on each
