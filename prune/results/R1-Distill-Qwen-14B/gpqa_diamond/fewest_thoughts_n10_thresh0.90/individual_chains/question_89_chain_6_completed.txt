Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, forming a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to make product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the 1H NMR coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

First, I'll tackle each step one by one.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromo something) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. Since it's dibromoadamantane, the structure is adamantane with two bromines on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH would likely cause an E2 elimination, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bicyclic compound. Adamantane itself is a diamondoid structure, so maybe the positions aren't adjacent but across a bridge. Oh wait, wait, maybe the positions are such that elimination would form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a di bromide undergoing dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a diene. But wait, let's think about the product.

Alternatively, perhaps KOH in such conditions causes the formation of an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides are usually formed from alkenes via peracids. Alternatively, wait, maybe when a dihalide undergoes elimination with a strong base, it forms an alkene. But since there are two bromines, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Are they adjacent? Let me think about the structure of adamantane.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so four-membered rings, all bridgehead positions. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgeheads, each on opposite sides. Hmm. If you eliminate HBr from each, perhaps you form a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to Bredt's rule, which says that bridgehead positions cannot have double bonds unless the bridge is sufficiently large. Wait, but adamantane's structure is such that each bridge is a single bond, so forming a double bond at a bridgehead might not be feasible. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination. Another possibility is substitution. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So perhaps the dibromide undergoes two SN2 reactions. But wait, adamantane is a very rigid structure, and each bridgehead is a tertiary carbon, making SN2 reactions unlikely because of steric hindrance. So substitution is probably not happening here.

Wait, another possibility: In the presence of a strong base like KOH and heat, perhaps the dibromide undergoes a ring-opening reaction. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that's typically for aryl halides.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne? No, that's usually with three or more halides. Hmm. Alternatively, wait, perhaps each Br is eliminated as HBr, so two eliminations to form an alkene. But again, the structure might not allow that because of Bredt's rule.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But that would need an alkene to start with, which doesn't make sense here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the NMR data given for product 1. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). IR has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of an ester or a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, 1720 is more in the range of an ester carbonyl (about 1720-1740 cm-1) or maybe a ketone (around 1700-1750 cm-1). Hmm.

So product 1 has a carbonyl group. Wait, the reaction of a dihalide with KOH could yield a diol if it's a substitution, but that wouldn't form a carbonyl. Alternatively, elimination to form a carbonyl? Like forming a ketone via dehydrohalogenation twice. Wait, but how would that work?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a strong base, leading to a double elimination to form a ketone. For example, vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a ketone. So maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon heating with KOH, undergoes two E2 eliminations, losing two HBr molecules, and forming a ketone group.

But wait, the product would then have a ketone. Let's think: if the two Br are on adjacent carbons (assuming they are), eliminating HBr from each would form a carbonyl group. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane—I think in adamantane, the positions are not adjacent but separated. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the positions are such that elimination forms a bridgehead carbonyl, but that's probably not possible.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the NMR data. Product 1's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a downfield shift, probably for an -OCH2- group. The 2H could be from an ether or an ester, perhaps. The 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm likely correspond to the adamantane ring protons. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be from another group, perhaps a methylene next to an oxygen.

Wait, so product 1's IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. So what would have a carbonyl and an OCH2 group? Maybe it's a ketone with an adjacent ether group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the carbonyl. Or maybe it's a carbonate? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Williamson ether synthesis, but that would require an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH might lead to a Dieckmann condensation if it's a cyclic dihalide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution with KOH. Each Br is replaced by an -O- group. But since it's KOH, perhaps it's forming an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxides are formed from alkenes, not dihalides.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the product. If KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a ketone. If the product has a carbonyl, and an OCH2 group, perhaps it's an ester? No, because then you'd have an ester carbonyl, but the NMR would show a different pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone. But then the NMR would show two sets of peaks around 2.2 or so for the carbonyls, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again: 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the dihalide reacts to form a glycol, but that would be via substitution, which is unlikely for such a hindered structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hoffman elimination, but that's usually for amides. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl and an alcohol? But the IR would show both a carbonyl and an OH. However, the IR given only has the 1720 cm-1 peak, which is strong, so maybe that's the main functional group.

Hmm. Another approach: let's think about the product after KOH. Maybe it's a ketone. Then, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with excess aluminum isopropoxide.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, perhaps in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then maybe product 2 is an acylium ion or something, but not sure.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. If KOH caused the formation of an epoxide, but I thought that required an alkene. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide underwent an elimination to form an alkene, and then epoxidation, but no, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product after KOH. If it's a ketone, then product 1 would be a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe that's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 produces an alkene via elimination, which is then subjected to another reaction.

Wait, perhaps step 1 forms an alkene. Because the IR doesn't show a carbonyl, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Wait, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester or ketone. Let me think again.

If step 1 is elimination to form an alkene, but then the IR doesn't show a peak for an alkene (like around 1650 cm-1). Hmm. Maybe the IR peak is from an ester, but how?

Alternatively, maybe step 1 forms a diol via substitution. But that would require two SN2 reactions, which are unlikely in such a hindered environment.

Wait, perhaps the initial step forms a cyclic ether. For example, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH to form a cyclic ether via an SN2 mechanism. But again, the structure is very hindered, making SN2 unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone, which would explain the IR peak. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide. Now, if product 1 is a ketone, what would happen when you heat it with Al(OiPr)3? Maybe it's used in some acylation reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck on step 1. Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl. So if product 1 has a carbonyl, perhaps step 1 is an elimination forming a ketone. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the base could abstract a beta-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, if we have two bromines on adjacent carbons, and each undergoes elimination, perhaps removing HBr from each, forming a ketone. For example, if the structure is R-Br-CH2-Br-R', elimination would form R-CO-R', but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the two bromines are on the same carbon, but the question says 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so they are on different carbons.

Hmm. Maybe the product is an epoxide. But then, where's the carbonyl?

Wait, if the product has a carbonyl, perhaps it's a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that would require substitution, which seems unlikely.

Another thought: maybe the KOH is acting as a base, causing the elimination of two HBr molecules to form a conjugated diene. But then, the IR might show C=C peaks, which I don't see mentioned. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, I'm stuck on product 1. Let me think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 ppm peak (2H) suggests perhaps an -OCH2- group. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) likely corresponds to the adamantane ring, which is a very rigid structure. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl.

So maybe product 1 is an adamantane derivative with an ester group. For example, a ketone might not have an OCH2 group, but an ester would. Hmm.

Wait, if product 1 is an ester, then the IR would show the carbonyl peak around 1720 cm-1. So maybe the reaction is forming an ester via some kind of substitution or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of a geminal diol, but that doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonate, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an -O- group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become 1,3-di-etheroxadamatane or something. But then, the NMR would show a peak for the oxygenated protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a glycol, but that would require substitution, which is unlikely in such a hindered structure.

At this point, maybe I should move to step 2. Let's say product 1 has a carbonyl group. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts reactions as a Lewis acid catalyst. So if product 1 is an aromatic compound, perhaps it's undergoing an acylation. But adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is something else.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a ketone, heating with Al(OiPr)3 could facilitate a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an acid anhydride, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a diol after acid workup. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the overall process. The second step is product 1 heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis.

Ozonolysis is used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond. So, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl compound, and product 2 is an alkene.

Wait, how could product 1 (a ketone) become product 2 (an alkene)? Maybe via a dehydration reaction, but KOH was already used in step 1. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination.

But wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is perhaps an enol ether or something else. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination. But then, what would cause that? Heating with Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, perhaps facilitating some kind of elimination.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an alkene formed via an E1 or E2 mechanism. So, for example, if product 1 has an ester group adjacent to a bromine, but no, product 1 comes from the reaction of the dibromide with KOH, which would eliminate the bromides.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the entire process.

Let me consider each step again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1).

Assuming product 1 is a ketone. Because the IR shows a carbonyl, and the NMR has an OCH2 group? Or perhaps it's an ester.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps it's an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a glycol, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed to form product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Thus, product 2 has an alkene. So, product 2 is formed from product 1 via some reaction that introduces a double bond.

So step 2: product 1 → product 2 (alkene) via Al(OiPr)3. So, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and under the influence of Al(OiPr)3, it loses water to form an alkene (dehydration). Or, product 1 is a ketone or ester, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, then product 2 could be a diol after ring-opening. But that's a guess.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diester, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the Al(OiPr)3 is a catalyst for some kind of elimination. 

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and then under acid conditions (Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid), it dehydrates to form an alkene. So, product 1 would be a diol, and product 2 an alkene.

But how does product 1 become a diol? That would imply that the initial reaction (step 1) is a substitution of Br with -OH groups. But in a dihalide, substitution would yield a diol. However, given that the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a dihalide, the substitution would form a diol. So product 1 would be 1,3-diol-adamantane.

Wait, but the NMR data for product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which might correspond to -OCH2- group. Wait, if the product is a diol, each -OH would be on a bridgehead carbon. But the NMR would show broad peaks for the -OH groups, unless they are exchanged. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is protected. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR for product 1 doesn't show any broad peaks, implying that the -OH groups are either not present or are deuterated. So, perhaps the product isn't a diol. So maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of product 1 as a ketone. So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, when heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, but how would a ketone form an alkene? Maybe via the formation of an enol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination of an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an alkene formed by eliminating an alcohol group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether, and product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination of an alcohol.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the IR of product 1. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, which could be an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. Product 1's NMR shows 2H at 4.79 ppm, which could be from an ester's R-O-CO-O-R group. Wait, no, that's for an ester. Wait, an ester's structure is R-O-CO-R. So the oxygenated CH2 group could be part of the ester.

But how would the initial reaction produce an ester? That would require an esterification, but with KOH, which is a base, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't a substitution but an elimination followed by something else. Maybe the elimination forms a carbonyl, and then another reaction occurs. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is an epoxide. But I'm not seeing how that would result in a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is replaced by a ketone group, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that product 1 is an ether. The NMR shows an OCH2 group, perhaps as part of an epoxide. Then, product 2 is a diol formed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide.

But then, product 3 would be the ozonolysis product of the diol. But that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about product 3. Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 2 is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 would show peaks for these carbonyl-adjacent protons.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding those that exchange.

In ozonolysis, the cleavage of a double bond would produce carbonyls. The adjacent protons would couple with neighboring protons.

Assuming product 2 is an alkene, say, trans or cis, the ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups. The adjacent protons would be on either side of the carbonyl.

So, for example, if product 2 is an alkene like CH2=CH2, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules, but that's a simple case. But in our case, the alkene is part of a larger structure, perhaps adamantane.

Wait, product 2 is formed from product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Product 1's NMR shows peaks that might correspond to an adamantane structure with an OCH2 group and a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. For example, if the starting dibromide underwent substitution to form an ester. But how? Maybe each Br was replaced by an OR group, but that would require two substitutions, which seems unlikely in a hindered environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclic ester, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: let's think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded proton would likely be near an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So, perhaps it's adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In ozonolysis of product 2, which is an alkene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The adjacent protons would be those on the carbons next to the carbonyl. These protons would couple with their neighboring protons.

Wait, let's imagine product 2 is a simple alkene, say, CH2=CH2. Ozonolysis would break it into two formaldehyde molecules. But in our case, the structure is more complex.

Alternatively, product 2 is a substituted alkene. For example, if product 2 is (CH2)nCH=CH(CH2)m, ozonolysis would break it into two ketones or aldehydes, depending on substitution.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl. These protons are typically split due to coupling with adjacent protons.

Assuming the structure after ozonolysis has a carbonyl group and adjacent protons, the coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

For example, if the proton is next to a CH2 group, it would couple with two protons, giving a triplet. If next to a CH group with two adjacent protons, it would be a quartet. But wait, the options given are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Wait, let's consider a specific example. Suppose product 2 is a substituted alkene, perhaps a trans-diene. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be on each side.

If the structure is like (CH2)k-C=CH-(CH2)m, then ozonolysis would produce (CH2)k-CO and O=C-(CH2)m, but wait, that's not quite right. Actually, ozonolysis of an alkene typically produces carbonyl compounds. So if the alkene is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes.

But if the alkene is part of a larger structure, like in adamantane, then the ozonolysis would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups at each end.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alkene within an adamantane structure. So, product 2 is an adamantane derivative with a double bond, perhaps in a bridge position.

Ozonolysis would then break that double bond into two carbonyl groups. The adjacent protons would be on the same bridge, perhaps as CH2 groups.

So, the product 3 would have protons adjacent to carbonyl groups. These protons would be on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl.

Each of these protons would be split by their neighboring protons. For example, a CH2 group next to a carbonyl would have each proton coupling with the two adjacent protons on the same CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the structure is more complex, maybe each CH2 is next to another CH2, leading to more splitting.

Wait, let me imagine a structure. Suppose product 2 is adamantane with a double bond between two bridgehead carbons. Ozonolysis would cleave this double bond, leading to two ketone groups.

So, for example, if the structure is:

Bridgehead-CR2=CR2-Bridgehead

After ozonolysis, it would become:

Bridgehead-CO-R and R-CO-Bridgehead?

But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis of product 2 (an alkene) leads to two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group. Then, each CH2 group's protons would couple with each other and possibly with other adjacent protons.

Wait, for each CH2 group next to a carbonyl, the protons would be split by the adjacent CH2 group. Let's say each CH2 has two protons, and each is adjacent to another CH2 group with two protons.

So each proton would be coupled to two neighboring protons (from the adjacent CH2 group), leading to a triplet. But if each CH2 group is also coupled to another set of protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, if each CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each proton would couple with two protons (on the same CH2) and also with two protons (on the adjacent CH2 group), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, here's an example: a structure like CH2-CO-R and R-CO-CH2. The protons on each CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl and to another CH2 group.

So, for a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, each H would be coupled with the two H on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and with the two H on the next CH2 (giving another triplet). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but each proton is coupled to two protons on its own CH2 (giving a triplet) and two protons on the adjacent CH2 (giving another triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, meaning each peak would split into 3x3=9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each proton is coupled with two adjacent protons (say, from the same CH2 group) and one proton from a neighboring group. That would give a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 group is next to another CH2 group and also to a CH group, leading to different splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is only coupled to one neighboring group. For example, each CH2 is next to a CH group, which has two protons. Then, each CH2 proton would couple with two protons from the same CH2 (triplet) and with two protons from the adjacent CH group (quartet), leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted alkene, leading to two identical carbonyl groups after ozonolysis. Each CH2 group next to the carbonyl would have two protons, each coupling with the two adjacent protons on the same CH2 and the two on the adjacent CH2, but that might not fit any of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

Hmm. Let me think of a scenario where the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each H is coupled with two H on the same CH2 and two H on the adjacent CH2. That would be a triplet of triplets, option B.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two H from the same CH2 and one H from another group, that would be a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with three different sets of H, the splitting could be more complex, but perhaps it's a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between two different groups, each contributing two H, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH group with two H. So the coupling would be with two H from the same CH2 and two H from the adjacent CH.

In that case, each H would split into a triplet (from the same CH2) and a quartet (from the adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of quartets, which isn't an option.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about a simpler structure.

Suppose product 2 is a simple alkene, like an exocyclic double bond. Ozonolysis would produce a carbonyl group and an adjacent CH2 group.

For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-R, ozonolysis would give O=CH-R and O=C=O (depending on the structure). But in reality, ozonolysis of CH2=CH-R would give RCHO and HCHO (formaldehyde). The CH2 group in product 3 would be the HCHO part, but the RCHO would have protons adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, no, because the R group would be part of the adamantane structure.

Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, the structure has a carbonyl group and a CH2 group next to it. The CH2 protons would be split by the adjacent group.

So, if the CH2 is next to a CH2 group that's part of the adamantane, which might have equivalent protons, the coupling could be a triplet.

Wait, in this case, the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Each H on this CH2 would be coupled with the two H on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and perhaps also with adjacent H from another group.

But if the adjacent group is a CH2 that's part of the adamantane ring, which is a rigid structure, the coupling might be with two H, leading to a triplet.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Thus, the answer might be A) triplet.

But wait, could there be more splitting? If the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two H on the same CH2 (triplet) and the two H on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets, option B.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure. However, given the options, I'm leaning towards a triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a double elimination of HBr, forming a ketone. This is supported by the IR spectrum of product 1, which shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with an oxygenated group (likely -OCH₂-) and a rigid adamantane framework.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**  
   Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely facilitates the formation of an alkene (product 2) via dehydration or elimination. The exact mechanism is unclear, but the formation of an alkene is consistent with the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group, as these protons are highly deshielded due to the electronegative nature of the carbonyl.

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with neighboring protons. If the structure is such that this hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group, each proton would couple with two protons on the same CH₂ (forming a triplet) and two protons on the adjacent CH₂ (forming another triplet). This results in a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.

**Answer: B**
