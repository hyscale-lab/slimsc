Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's read it again. The state of the system is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1), wait, but wait, isn't that a vector? Oh, right, the state vector is a column vector, so it's like three components stacked vertically. Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The components are -1, 2, and 1. The magnitude squared would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which is not 1. So maybe I need to normalize it? Or perhaps the question assumes it's already normalized, but that's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps the state is given without being a unit vector, and I should consider its norm in calculations. I'll have to keep that in mind.

The question involves two observables, P and Q. The matrices for their operators are given. When someone measures Q just after measuring P, we need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but the measurements are done in sequence. So first P is measured, then Q. But wait, the probabilities for both events happening together—so the joint probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, but how do measurements work when done sequentially? The first measurement of P will collapse the state vector into an eigenstate of P. Then, the measurement of Q is done on this new state. So the overall probability is the probability of collapsing into a particular eigenstate of P (that gives P=0) multiplied by the probability of getting Q=-1 in that new state.

Alternatively, I think the correct approach is to compute the state after the first measurement and then compute the probability for the second measurement.

Wait, but wait—another approach: since the measurements are sequential, you have to account for the possible outcomes after each step. So first, when you measure P, the state will collapse into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, in that eigenstate, you measure Q and find the probability of getting -1.

Alternatively, if the measurement of P doesn't result in 0, we wouldn't consider those cases. So the total probability is the probability of getting 0 in P multiplied by the probability of getting -1 in Q given that P was 0.

So the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the P operator. Let's write down the P matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0,1/sqrt(2),0).

Hmm. I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's set up the characteristic equation. The matrix P is 3x3, so the determinant of (P - λI) should be zero.

So the matrix P - λI is:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]
[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Computing the determinant:

The determinant is the sum of the products along the diagonals minus the products of the off-diagonals. But it's a bit time-consuming, perhaps I can compute it.

Another approach: perhaps P has some symmetry that can help me. Let me see if I can guess any eigenvectors.

Looking for eigenvectors: let's consider a vector (a, b, c). Applying P to it.

P*(a, b, c)^T = [ (0*a + 1/sqrt(2)*b + 0*c ), (1/sqrt(2)*a + 0*b + 1/sqrt(2)*c ), (0*a + 1/sqrt(2)*b + 0*c ) ]^T.

So the resulting vector is (b/sqrt(2), (a + c)/sqrt(2), b/sqrt(2)).

If this is an eigenstate with eigenvalue λ, then:

b/sqrt(2) = λ a
(a + c)/sqrt(2) = λ b
b/sqrt(2) = λ c

Hmm, that's a system of equations. Let's think about them.

From the first and third equations:

b/sqrt(2) = λ a
b/sqrt(2) = λ c

So λ a = λ c. If λ is not zero, then a = c.

But let's also consider that from the second equation:

(a + c) = sqrt(2) λ b.

But since a = c (from λ≠0), this becomes 2a = sqrt(2) λ b.

From the first equation, b = λ a * sqrt(2). So substituting into this:

2a = sqrt(2) λ (lambda a sqrt(2)) )

Wait, let me substitute. Let me let b = (lambda a) sqrt(2) from equation one.

Wait, actually, equation one: b/sqrt(2) = λ a → b = λ a sqrt(2).

So, substituting into the second equation:

( a + c ) / sqrt(2) = λ b → (2a)/sqrt(2) = λ * (lambda a sqrt(2)) )

Wait, because a = c, so a + c = 2a.

So equation two: [2a]/sqrt(2) = λ * (lambda a sqrt(2)) )

Wait, λ times b is λ * (lambda a sqrt(2)).

So [2a]/sqrt(2) = λ^2 a sqrt(2) )

We can cancel a from both sides (assuming a ≠0, otherwise trivial solution).

So 2/sqrt(2) = λ^2 sqrt(2)

Simplify 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). So sqrt(2) = λ^2 sqrt(2)

Divide both sides by sqrt(2): 1 = λ^2 → λ = ±1.

So possible eigenvalues are 1 and -1, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Or perhaps there's another eigenvalue.

Wait, but the trace of the matrix P is the sum of the diagonal elements. The diagonal elements of P are 0, 0, 0. So the trace is 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0. If eigenvalues are 1, -1, and another value?

Wait, no, the trace is the sum of eigenvalues. So if P is a 3x3 matrix with trace zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

Wait, but in this calculation, we found eigenvalues 1 and -1, but that would sum to zero only if the third eigenvalue is zero.

Ah! So perhaps the third eigenvalue is zero.

So the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0.

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, and 0.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

So first, I need to find the eigenvectors for P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So for λ = 0, the matrix P - 0 I = P.

So the equations are:

b/sqrt(2) = 0 → b=0

(a + c)/sqrt(2) = 0 → a + c =0 → c = -a

b/sqrt(2) = 0 → already, b is 0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where b=0 and c = -a. So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a) → which can be written as a*(1, 0, -1).

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 0, -1). Let me check this: P*(1,0,-1) should equal 0*(1,0,-1).

Calculating P*(1,0,-1):

First component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 +0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1 -1)/sqrt(2) = 0.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

So yes, (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector for λ=0.

But wait, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me write that as a vector:

state = [ -1; 2; 1 ]

But wait, the vector (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector for P corresponding to 0.

So the projection of the state onto this eigenvector will give the amplitude for measuring P=0. Then, the probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.

But wait, first, the eigenvector is (1,0,-1), which is a vector. To make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it.

The length squared is 1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the amplitude for the initial state to collapse into this eigenstate upon measuring P is the inner product between the initial state and the eigenvector.

So amplitude = [ -1, 2, 1 ] · [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ].

Let me compute that:

= (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) 
= (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) 
= (-2/sqrt(2)) 

Which simplifies to -sqrt(2). Because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2).

Wait, 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), so 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). So negative that is -sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is -sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this: (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But wait, the initial state isn't normalized. Because the initial state has a norm of sqrt(6), as I thought earlier.

So when calculating probabilities, we have to account for the normalization of the state. So perhaps the probability is ( |amplitude|^2 ) / ( |state|^2 ).

So the amplitude is [ (state · eigenvector) ].

Wait, the state's norm is sqrt(6), and the eigenvector is normalized. So the probability is ( |amplitude|^2 ) / ( norm^2 ) ).

So |amplitude|^2 is ( (-sqrt(2)) )^2 = 2.

The state's norm squared is 6.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 2/6 = 1/3.

So that's the first part. Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses into the eigenvector (1,0,-1), but normalized. So the new state is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, we measure Q. The matrix Q is given as:

Q = diag(1, 0, -1).

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. Because diagonal matrices have their eigenvectors as the standard basis.

So for Q, the eigenstates are |1> = (1,0,0), |0> = (0,1,0), and |-1> = (0,0,1).

So to find the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the state (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), we compute the inner product between this state and the eigenvector of Q for eigenvalue -1, which is (0,0,1).

So the amplitude for Q=-1 is the third component of the state, which is (-1/sqrt(2)).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but let me make sure. The state after measurement is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is (0,0,1). So the inner product is [1/sqrt(2)]*0 + 0*0 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = -1/sqrt(2).

The modulus squared is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the joint probability is the probability of P=0 (which is 1/3) multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0 (which is 1/2). So 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Because when you measure P first, the state collapses, and then you measure Q on that new state. So the probabilities are multiplied.

But wait, no, in this scenario, the initial state is collapsed into the eigenstate of P=0, and then in that state, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.


To solve the problem, we analyze the sequential measurements of the observables \( P \) and \( Q \) on the given quantum state. The state of the system is initially represented by the column vector \((-1, 2, 1)\), which is not normalized. The norm of the state is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

### Step 1: Measurement of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined to be \( 1, -1, \) and \( 0 \). The corresponding eigenvectors are found, and for \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is proportional to \((1, 0, -1)\). Normalizing this eigenvector gives:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is calculated as the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the initial state \((-1, 2, 1)\) and the normalized eigenvector \((1/\sqrt{2}, 0, -1/\sqrt{2})\):

\[
\text{Amplitude} = (-1)(1/\sqrt{2}) + 2(0) + 1(-1/\sqrt{2}) = -\sqrt{2}.
\]

\[
\text{Probability of } P = 0 = \frac{|-\sqrt{2}|^2}{\sqrt{6}^2} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 2: Measurement of \( Q \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is given by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, \) and \( -1 \), with eigenvectors corresponding to the standard basis vectors. For \( Q = -1 \), the eigenvector is \((0, 0, 1)\). After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to the normalized eigenvector of \( P \) corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \), which is:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between this state and the eigenvector of \( Q \) corresponding to \( \lambda = -1 \):

\[
\text{Amplitude} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0) + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

\[
\text{Probability of } Q = -1 = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Joint Probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
\text{Joint Probability} = \text{Probability of } P = 0 \times \text{Probability of } Q = -1 = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:
