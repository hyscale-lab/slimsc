Okay, so I've got this question about a peptidic compound's analysis, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly as expected except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts, their integrals add up to 1H, and the coupling pattern isn't due to spin-spin coupling. Hmm, what could cause duplicate peaks in NMR without coupling?

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So same mass, same retention time? Well, same mass but two peaks—could be isomers or something else. But since the mass spectrum is the same, they must have the same molecular formula, maybe different structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that were the case, the mass would be different. The precursor would have a higher mass, right? Because the expected product is formed from the precursor. So in LC-MS, you’d see two peaks with different masses. But the question says both have the same mass as expected. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular formula, same mass. In NMR, enantiomers would show the same peaks because they’re mirror images. Unless the compound is not chiral or the NMR is run in a chiral environment. Wait, but the question says the same alpha-proton appears as two peaks. Typically, enantiomers in a racemic mixture would give a single peak because they're identical in terms of NMR if the environment is achiral. Or wait, maybe if the sample isn't pure but has some impurities, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, enantiomers wouldn't split the peaks. So maybe B isn't the right answer. Or perhaps I'm forgetting something.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. I'm not entirely sure what 'double coupling' means here. Maybe during the reaction, like if two different bonds formed, but I'm not sure how that would cause duplicate peaks. Or perhaps it's a case where an amide bond formation led to some kind of coupling that produces two peaks. I'm not certain about this one.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would appear as separate peaks in LC-MS. In NMR, their peaks would split if the diastereomers are present. But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Diastereomers would have different chemical shifts, so each would have their own set of peaks. But if the alpha-proton is in a different environment in each diastereomer, each would have different shifts. But in the question, the two peaks have similar shifts. Hmm, maybe not D then.

Wait, let me think again about the NMR. The two peaks are for the same alpha-proton, which shouldn't be the case if it's diastereomers. Because each diastereomer would have its own environment, so each would have their own set of protons. Unless the alpha-proton is in the same environment in both diastereomers. But that's unlikely unless the stereochemistry is elsewhere. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: what about tautomerism? Like, maybe the compound has two tautomers that are in equilibrium. But then, in NMR, we'd see peaks that might merge or be split, but the question says the integrals add up to 1H, so maybe each is 0.5H. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, the NMR could be due to exchange processes. But the question says the peaks are from the same alpha-proton, so perhaps it's something about the structure causing the same proton to split into two.

Wait, but the initial thought was about the NMR: if the same proton appears as two peaks, but the integrals add to 1H, and coupling isn't the issue. So maybe the sample is a racemic mixture—so two enantiomers.
