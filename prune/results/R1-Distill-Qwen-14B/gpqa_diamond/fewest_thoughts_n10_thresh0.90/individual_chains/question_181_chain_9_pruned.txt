Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question about the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch stopped suddenly in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun to Earth, right? So if something happened in the core, the neutrinos would have already reached us, and the change would be noticeable now.

The question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So I need to find Flux(band1)/Flux(band2).

I remember that neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions in the Sun, particularly the proton-proton chain. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch produces neutrinos at different energies.

Wait, the pp-III branch is the one that produces the highest energy neutrinos. Oh right! Because pp-III involves the fusion of three helium-4 nuclei into carbon-12, which emits a positron and a neutrino. The neutrinos from this process are higher energy, around 17-20 MeV. But wait, the bands we're looking at are in the hundreds of keV range. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the dominant neutrino production in the Sun is from the pp-I branch, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. Oh wait, no. The main pp chain (pp-I) produces neutrinos around 0.4 MeV, which is 400 keV. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, maybe that affects higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, but the question is about the flux in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands. So these are in the ~1 MeV range. Hmm. I think the higher energy neutrinos come from the heavier elements' fusion processes, like the CNO cycle maybe? Or perhaps from the later stages of the proton-proton chain.

Wait, the proton-proton chain has a few branches. The main one, pp-I, produces two protons fusing into deuterium, then into helium-4. The neutrinos from this are low energy, like ~0.4 MeV. The pp-II branch involves more steps, maybe involving boron or something, and produces higher-energy neutrinos. Oh, wait, in the pp-II branch, a helium-3 and a proton fuse to make boron-8, which then decays into two alpha particles. The neutrinos in this case are higher energy, around 1.5 MeV perhaps.

And the pp-III branch, which I think is another step in the proton-proton chain, involves three helium-4 nuclei fusing into carbon-12, and then maybe further reactions. Yeah, that's the triple-alpha process, I think. So the neutrinos from pp-III would be higher energy, say around 17 MeV or so. But the bands are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, which is way lower than that.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Did I get the branches confused? Hmm, maybe pp-III is another part of the chain that emits neutrinos in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II branch is involved in producing higher-energy neutrinos, around 1.5 MeV, and the pp-III branch produces even higher, like around 5 MeV. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me think differently. The flux of solar neutrinos is dominated by the pp-I process, which produces a lot of low-energy neutrinos. If the pp-III branch stops, which produces higher-energy neutrinos, then the high-energy part of the spectrum would drop.

The question is about the ratio of flux between two bands. If the pp-III branch stops, then the neutrinos from that branch (higher energy) would no longer be reaching us. So, the flux in higher energy bands would decrease more than lower ones.

But let's look at the bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So they're adjacent, just a 100 keV window each.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, which part contributes more to these bands?

Wait, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy, say around 17 MeV. So those would be much higher than the bands in question. So perhaps the bands in question are dominated by pp-II or pp-I processes.

Wait, perhaps I confused the bands. The 700-800 keV is 0.7-0.8 MeV, and 800-900 keV is 0.8-0.9 MeV. Hmm, the pp-I neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV, so that's lower than both. The pp-II branch would produce higher, perhaps around 1.5 MeV. So maybe the bands here (0.7-0.9 MeV) are in between pp-I and pp-II.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stopped, but it's producing neutrinos at higher energies, then the bands in question (700-900 keV) are lower than that. So the flux in these lower bands wouldn't be affected? Or wait, perhaps the pp-III process contributes to the production of neutrinos in these bands.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let's think about the main sources of neutrinos in the Sun.

The dominant process is the proton-proton chain, which has two main branches. The first (pp-I) produces low-energy neutrinos (around 0.4 MeV), and the second (pp-II) produces higher-energy neutrinos (~1.5 MeV). The pp-III branch is another part of the chain that produces even higher-energy neutrinos. Wait, maybe the triple-alpha process is a part of the pp-III branch, which does indeed produce higher-energy neutrinos.

But what about the specific energy ranges of the neutrinos in the bands given?

If pp-III is stopped, then the neutrinos from that branch would no longer be present. If those neutrinos were in the higher energy bands, like above say 10 MeV, then the bands we're looking at (0.7-0.9 MeV) wouldn't be affected much. Hence, the flux ratio between Band 1 and Band 2 would remain similar to before, maybe. But the question says that all other reactions remained as they were. So only the pp-III branch stopped.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the fluxes in two specific bands. Let's say that without the pp-III branch, the flux in higher energy neutrinos (like Band 2) would decrease, but the lower band (Band 1) is unaffected. Or perhaps the opposite?

Wait, maybe the neutrinos in the bands are from the same process. For example, the pp-III branch might contribute to a broader spectrum. If the pp-III branch is stopped, then the flux in both bands could change.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes more neutrinos in the higher energy band (Band 2) than in Band 1. So if it's stopped, Band 2's flux would drop more than Band 1's.

So the ratio Band1/Band2 would increase, because Band2 is now less than before. So if before stopping, the ratio was X, now it would be a higher ratio.

But without knowing the initial ratio, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino spectrum has a certain shape, and the pp-III branch contributes more to higher energies. So stopping it would reduce the high energy flux more.

In the Sun, the neutrino flux as a function of energy has a peak around 0.4 MeV (pp-I), then a shoulder around 1-2 MeV (pp-II), and perhaps a tail from even higher energies (pp-III).

If pp-III is stopped, then the flux at higher energies (Band2, 0.8-0.9 MeV) would decrease more than Band1 (0.7-0.8). So the flux in Band2 is lower than before, and Band1 is mostly unaffected. Thus, the ratio Band1/Band2 would increase.

Wait, but what if the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy bands than these? Then stopping pp-III would have no impact on these bands. But the question is about the ratio of the flux between these two bands. So perhaps the flux in both bands comes from the same source, so if a branch affecting both is stopped, how does it affect each?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the total neutrino flux. If it's stopped, the overall neutrino flux would drop, but the ratio between the bands might not change much. But the options don't have that as an optionâ€”looking at the options, choices are 0.0
