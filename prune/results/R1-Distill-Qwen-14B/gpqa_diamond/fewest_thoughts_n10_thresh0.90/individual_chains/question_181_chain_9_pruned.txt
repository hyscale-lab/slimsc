Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions in its core. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chains, and there are different branches of them. Oh right, pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III, I think. 

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, that's interesting because the time it takes for changes in the Sun's core to reach the surface is about that long. So any changes in the neutrino flux would take time to be observed on Earth. But the question is about the flux reaching us now, so the changes should have happened in the core and the neutrinos we're detecting are from that change.

I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux1 / flux2.

I remember that the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. Or wait, which branch produces which energies? Let me think. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos because it involves the fusion of protons into deuterons with a positron and a neutrino. The pp-II branch might involve higher energies, but pp-III is even more energetic.

Wait, no, actually, the main neutrino emission comes from the pp-I chain. The pp-II and pp-III are part of the proton-proton chains but with slightly different mechanisms. The pp-III chain involves the reaction where two protons fuse into a deuteron, then another proton fuses, but with some steps. The neutrinos from the pp-I are lower energy, around 0.5 MeV, while the pp-II and pp-III produce higher energy neutrinos, maybe up to 1 MeV or so.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those high-energy neutrinos (above a certain threshold) would drop. But wait, the question is about the ratio between two bands, one just below and one above 800 keV.

Wait, neutrinos from the pp-III branch would be at higher energies. So if pp-III stops, that would reduce the number of high-energy neutrinos. So band 2 is 800-900 keV, which would have been primarily from pp-III. Band 1 is 700-800, perhaps from pp-I or pp-II.

But wait, the pp-I neutrinos are around 0.5 MeV, which is 500 keV. So 700-800 is higher than that. Hmm. So maybe the pp-II and pp-III contribute to higher energy bands. So if pp-III stops, then the flux in higher bands would drop, but the lower ones (like band 1) would remain the same.

Wait, but the problem says that all other reactions remained as they were. So other branches, like pp-I and pp-II, are still active. So the neutrinos from those would still be produced.

So, if we stop pp-III, then the flux in the higher energy bands (like band 2, 800-900 keV) would drop, because pp-III was a significant source for those energies. But the lower band (700-800) would not be affected as much because it's covered by pp-I and pp-II.

Therefore, the flux in band 2 would decrease, while band 1 remains similar. So the ratio (flux1/flux2) would increase because flux2 is lower now.

Wait, but what was the flux distribution before stopping pp-III? Let me think about the relative contributions. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to pp-I, I think. Or maybe not? Wait, the pp-I is the dominant one but produces lower energy neutrinos. So maybe the higher energy neutrinos (like in band 2) are mostly from pp-III.

So before the stoppage, band 2 (800-900) would have a certain flux from pp-III. If pp-III stops, then band 2's flux would drop. Band 1's flux would stay the same because it's from pp-I and possibly pp-II, which are still active.

So the ratio of band1 to band2 would be higher than before.

Wait, what was the original ratio? Before the stoppage, band2 had a certain amount of neutrinos from pp-III. So if band2 is mostly from pp-III, then stopping it would drop band2's flux. Let's say band1 was from pp-I and maybe some pp-II, so their flux is unaffected.

So the initial scenario: band1 is from pp-I and pp-II. band2 is mostly from pp-III. So before the stoppage, band2 had more or less flux than band1?

Wait, the pp-I produces lower energy neutrinos. So the 700-800 keV band might have some contribution from pp-I, but maybe the main source is pp-II. Or maybe the pp-II produces higher energies than pp-I but lower than pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the highest energy neutrinos are from pp-III. So if we stop pp-III, the higher energy bands (like 800-900) would have much less flux.

So the ratio of flux1 (700-800) to flux2 (800-900) would be higher.

Wait, let me think about the typical neutrino energy distributions. The most abundant are from the pp-I chain, around 0.5 MeV (500 ke
