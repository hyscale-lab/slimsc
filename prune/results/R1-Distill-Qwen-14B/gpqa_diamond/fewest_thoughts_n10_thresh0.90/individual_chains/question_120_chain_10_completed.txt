Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Then, it's asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various power laws, like 1 over plx to some exponent.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So a higher parallax means a closer star, and a lower parallax means a more distant star.

Wait, but how does this tie into the number of stars per unit parallax range? I think this has to do with the volume of space at a certain distance. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume would depend on how much volume is there.

Let me think about the geometry here. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d would be proportional to the surface area of the shell and the thickness. But wait, since the distribution is uniform, the number should depend on the volume. Wait, no, in 3D space, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So the number in a volume element dV would be n = constant * dV.

But when you consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr (the change in distance), the volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² dr.

But the question is about parallax, not distance. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So let's express everything in terms of plx.

If I have a small change in parallax, say, a range from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding range in distance? Let me see: plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So if plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (d (dplx)) = -(1/plx^2) dplx. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the relationship between the thickness in distance and the thickness in parallax.

Wait, consider a small range in parallax, say δplx. What's the corresponding distance range? Let me think about differentials.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So the differential distance dr is the derivative of d with respect to plx, multiplied by δplx. So, dr = (d/d plx)(1/plx) ) * δplx. The derivative of 1/plx is -1/plx², so dr = (-1/plx²) δplx. Wait, but δplx is positive when plx increases, which would mean dr is negative. Hmm, perhaps I should take the absolute value, so |dr| = (1/plx²) δplx.

So the volume element in terms of parallax would be a shell at plx with a thickness δplx. But since each shell is a sphere, the volume in terms of distance is 4πd² dr. But we need to express this in terms of plx.

Let me write everything in terms of plx. d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx². The volume of the shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) δplx? Wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I'm mixing up variables here.

Wait, the volume element for a thin shell in distance is 4πd² dr. As I said, dr is (1/plx²) δplx, but wait dr is in terms of distance, which is 1/plx. So the volume in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) δplx. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recast it.

Wait, perhaps I should express the volume in terms of plx. Let's think of it as a thin shell in plx. The thickness is δplx. So the distance is d = 1/plx. The volume of the shell at a certain d and thickness dr is 4πd² dr. But we can express dr in terms of δplx.

So, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the thickness in distance dr is (1/plx²) dplx (since the negative just indicates direction, but volume is positive). So the volume of the shell is 4πd² * |dr|. Substituting d=1/plx and |dr|= (1/plx²) dplx:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in this volume would be proportional to the volume, since the number density is uniform. So number of stars N = k * Volume = k * (1/plx^4) dplx, where k is some constant.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So, the number per unit plx would be N/(dplx), which is k*(1/plx^4). So the number density is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options are given as ~ 1/plx^something. So the number per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4? That would correspond to option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the number of stars in a certain range of parallax. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, as you go to larger parallax (closer stars), the distances are smaller. The number of stars expected within a certain range of parallax would depend on the volume of space in that range.

Imagine a range of parallax from plx to plx + δplx. The corresponding distance range is from d = 1/plx to d + δd = 1/(plx + δplx). So δd ≈ - (1/plx^2) δplx. So the volume between d and d + δd is 4π d² δd = 4π (1/plx)^2 (1/(plx²)) δplx) = 4π (1/plx^4) δplx.

So the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4 multiplied by δplx. So when you take the number per unit plx range (i.e., per δplx), it's 1/plx^4. So the answer should be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the number of stars per unit volume is constant (since uniform distribution). So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n * dV, where n is the number density. The volume element as a function of distance is 4π d² dr, as before. But we're looking for the number per unit change in plx. Since plx is 1/d, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is the integral of n * 4π d^2 dr over the corresponding d range.

But perhaps an alternative approach is to consider the differential number of stars per unit plx. Let me think in terms of differentials.

Let N(plx) be the number of stars with parallax less than plx. Then dN/dplx is the number of stars per unit plx. The number of stars within a distance d is proportional to the volume up to that distance. The volume up to distance d is (4/3) π d^3. So N(d) = (4/3 π d^3) * n, where n is the number density.

But plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So N(plx) = (4/3 π (1/plx)^3 ) * n.

Then, the derivative dN/dplx is the number per unit plx. Let's compute that.

dN/dplx = d/dplx [ (4 π n /3) * (1/plx^3) ) ] 

= (4 π n /3) * (-3) (1/plx^4) )

= -4 π n (1/plx^4)

So the magnitude is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But wait, that's the same conclusion as before, so I think it's correct.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a volume element \( dV \) is proportional to \( dV \), as the number density \( n \) is constant.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume in terms of parallax becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, so the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of stars}}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

To confirm, we can also compute the cumulative number of stars \( N(\text{plx}) \) with parallax less than \( \text{plx} \). The cumulative volume up to distance \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) is \( \frac{4}{3}\pi d^3 \), so:

\[
N(\text{plx}) \propto \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^3.
\]

Taking the derivative \( \frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \), which represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax, gives:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but the magnitude confirms that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
