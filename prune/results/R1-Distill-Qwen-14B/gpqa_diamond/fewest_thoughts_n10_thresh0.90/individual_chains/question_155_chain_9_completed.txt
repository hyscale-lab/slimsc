Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the standard deviation formula, which involves the expectation values. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So ψ is this vector. 

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z. Oh right, the uncertainty in an observable Q is given by the square root of <Q²> minus <Q> squared. So, ΔQ = sqrt(<Q²> - <Q>²).

Wait, but wait. Since P_z is an operator, and the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So I can't just take the eigenvalue directly for the expectation value. I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

But wait, P_z is diagonal because its basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So maybe that will make calculations easier. Let me write down the matrix for P_z.

From the problem, P_z has components:
First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0,0,0]
Third row: [0,0,-ħ]

So it's a diagonal matrix with elements ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

The operator P_z is diagonal, so when I compute the expectation value <P_z>, it's just the sum of the products of |ψ_i|² multiplied by the corresponding diagonal elements.

The state ψ is given as a column vector with components:
ψ₁ = -1/2
ψ₂ = 1/√2
ψ₃ = -1/2

Wait, but I should normalize this vector. Let me check the norm: |ψ₁|² + |ψ₂|² + |ψ₃|².

Calculating each term:

|ψ₁|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4
|ψ₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
|ψ₃|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

Adding up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 =1. So it's already normalized. Good.

So <P_z> = ψ† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, <P_z> = |ψ₁|² * P_z11 + |ψ₂|² * P_z22 + |ψ₃|² * P_z33.

Wait:

P_z11 is ħ, P_z22 is 0, P_z33 is -ħ.

So:

= (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ)
= (ħ/4) - (ħ/4) = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero. Then, what about <P_z²>?

Well, since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of the diagonal elements. So each element is (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2, which is ħ², 0, ħ².

So <P_z²> is |ψ₁|² * (ħ)^2 + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (ħ)^2.

Which is (1/4) * ħ² + (1/4) * ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = ħ²/2.

So <P_z²> is ħ²/2, and <P_z> is 0.

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which is the same as sqrt(ħ²/2). So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating <P_z> or <P_z²>.

Calculating <P_z> again:

Yes, (1/4)*ħ + (0) + (1/4)*(-ħ) = 0. Correct.

<P_z²> is (1/4)*ħ² + (1/4)*ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ². So yes, sqrt(1/2) ħ is ħ/sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ along the diagonal. The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = | \psi_1 |^2 \cdot \hbar + | \psi_2 |^2 \cdot 0 + | \psi_3 |^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

The probabilities are:

\[
| \psi_1 |^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad | \psi_2 |^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad | \psi_3 |^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which results in a diagonal matrix with elements $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = | \psi_1 |^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + | \psi_2 |^2 \cdot 0 + | \psi_3 |^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
