Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors. So, the state vector here is probably [3i, 4], which is a column vector. Right, because in quantum mechanics, states are column vectors, and each component corresponds to a spin-up or spin-down state along a certain axis.

The question asks for the expectation value of S_y. Oh right, expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y. Because S is the spin operator, which for spin-½ particles is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. Oh wait, right! So the actual operator is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value would involve that.

Wait, let me get the Pauli matrix for y right. Oh yeah, σ_y is the matrix:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So the steps I need to follow are:

1. Write the state vector as a column vector. So ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

2. Compute ψ†, which is the conjugate transpose. So it becomes [ -3 (since 3i conjugated is -3), 4 ]. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3i is the top component, so its conjugate is -3i, but when transposed, since it's a row vector, the top component becomes [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait no, wait. Wait, the original vector is [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate would be [ -3i, 4 ]^T? No, wait, no. Wait, when you take the conjugate transpose, you first take the conjugate of each element, then transpose (so rows become columns and vice versa). So for ψ, the original is:

ψ = [3i]
      [4 ]

So ψ† is [ 3i*, 4* ] → [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

Wait, no, wait: 3i is a complex number. So its conjugate is -3i. So the conjugate transpose of ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] as the row vector.

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value is ψ† (σ_y) ψ multiplied by (ħ/2).

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute ψ† σ_y ψ, and then multiply by ħ/2 to get ⟨S_y⟩.

Wait, let me make sure. The spin component operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value would be (ħ/2) times ψ† σ_y ψ.

So first, I need to compute the matrix product ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, actually, the order is important. Because ψ† is a row vector, σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, and ψ is a column vector. So the product is ψ† multiplied by σ_y multiplied by ψ.

So let me compute that.

So let's compute ψ† σ_y:

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

σ_y is:
[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

So the product ψ† σ_y is:

First row of ψ† times first column of σ_y: (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 +4i =4i.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in matrix multiplication, the element (1,1) is row 1 of ψ† multiplied by column 1 of σ_y.

So:

Element (1,1): (-3i)(0) + 4*(i) = 0 +4i =4i.

Element (1,2): (-3i)*(-i) +4*(0) = (3i^2) + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

Wait, but ψ† is a 1x2 row vector, and σ_y is 2x2. So when you multiply ψ† (1x2) with σ_y (2x2), you get a 1x2 row vector.

So let's compute each element:

First element (position (1,1) of the resulting matrix? No, wait, the result of ψ† σ_y is a row vector. Let me think: ψ† is [a, b], σ_y is a 2x2 matrix. So when you multiply [a, b] * [ [c d], [e f] ], you get [ a c + b e, a d + b f ].

So let me compute:

a = -3i, b=4.

So first element: a*(element (1,1) of σ_y) + b*(element (2,1) of σ_y).

Which is (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 +4i → 4i.

Second element: a*(element (1,2) of σ_y) + b*(element (2,2) of σ_y).

Which is (-3i)(-i) +4*(0) → (3i^2) + 0 → 3*(-1) → -3.

So the product ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, this row vector multiplied by ψ (which is a column vector [3i, 4]^T):

So [4i, -3] * [3i; 4] = (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) → compute each term.

First term: 4i *3i = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: (-3)*4 = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, so the product ψ† σ_y ψ is -24.

But wait, that's just the trace? Or is that the inner product? Hmm.

Wait, the inner product should be a scalar, which is what we have here: -24.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24. But wait, no, because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24).

Wait wait, but wait, let me double-check my math. Because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let's recompute the product.

ψ† σ_y ψ:

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]

σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

So ψ† σ_y would be:

First, compute each component.

The resulting row vector:

First element: a*(0) + b*(i) → (-3i)(0) +4*(i) = 4i.

Second element: a*(-i) + b*(0) → (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 → (3i^2) = 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now multiply this by ψ, which is [3i, 4]^T.

So inner product: 4i *3i + (-3)*4.

Compute 4i * 3i: 12 i² → 12*(-1) = -12.

Then -3 *4 = -12.

So sum: -12 -12 = -24.

So ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24.

But wait, that can't be right because the Pauli matrices have trace 0 and all eigenvalues ±1, but that's okay because the state isn't necessarily normalized.

Wait, but let me check the normalization of the state ψ. Because the expectation value could depend on that.

Wait, the state ψ is [3i, 4]. So its norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2.

Which is (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So the state is |ψ> = (1/5)(3i,4) ?

Wait, no, wait: the state as given is (3i,4), but perhaps it's not normalized. So the actual state would be ψ/||ψ||, where ||ψ|| is the square root of ( (3i)(-3i) +4*4 ) → (9) +16 =25 → ||ψ||=5.

So in reality, the state is [3i,4]^T, so the normalized state is (1/5)(3i,4).

But in the calculation above, the expectation value was -24. Let me see: since the state is not normalized, the expectation value would be (ψ† σ_y ψ) divided by ψ† ψ.

Wait, wait, because the expectation value is (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ), because the state isn't necessarily normalized. Oh wait, but wait, for any operator, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if the state is not normalized.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because if |ψ> is already normalized, then ⟨ψ|ψ⟩=1, so the expectation is just ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

But if |ψ> is not normalized, the expectation value is (⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩ ) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the state is not normalized. So the expectation value of O is (⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩).

So in this case, I think I need to compute that.

Because in the previous calculation, ψ† σ_y ψ was -24, and ψ† ψ is (3i)(-3i) +4*4 = 9 +16=25. So the expectation value of σ_y is (-24)/(25).

So the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) times that.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

So looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25.

Wait, but let me double-check my normalization approach.

Yes, because when the state vector isn't normalized, the expectation value is (⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩) divided by (⟨ψ|ψ⟩).

So in this case, without normalizing, the expectation of σ_y is (-24)/25. So multiply by ħ/2.

So, ( (-24/25) ) * (ħ/2) = (-12 ħ)/25.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \psi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \psi \), and \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) ensures the state is normalized.

3. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \)**: The normalization factor is:
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \psi = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \)**: First, \( \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \). The product \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \) is:
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)**: Multiply \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \) with \( \psi \):
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]

6. **Expectation Value of \( \sigma_y \)**: The expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi} = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

7. **Expectation Value of \( S_y \)**: Finally, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

8. **Answer**: Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \text{A) } -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

Answer: A
