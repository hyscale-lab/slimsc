Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's see if I can figure it out. Alright, the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid to find the minimum volume needed and the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so when it's dissolved in an acid, they'll probably react.

First, I think I should write down the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. The acid is monobasic, so it'll donate one proton. Let me think: Fe(OH)3 is a base, so it'll react with H+ ions. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Wait, yeah, because each OH- from Fe(OH)3 will take a H+ from the acid. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 needs 3 moles of H+.

Now, I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The mass given is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). So 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. So moles = 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 mol.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the total H+ needed is 0.000936 *3 = 0.002808 mol. 

The acid is 0.1 M, which is moles per liter. So the volume needed is moles / concentration. So 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but the options don't have exactly 28.08. Option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. So is that the volume needed? But wait, the question says 'minimum volume'—so that's when all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, so yes, that's correct.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. After dissolving, we have Fe^3+ in solution. Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. The reaction would be Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. Wait, but hydrolysis of Fe^3+ produces H+ ions, so the solution is acidic. 

To find the pH, I need to find the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm³, right? So moles of Fe^3+ are 0.000936 mol. Concentration is moles/volume in liters. 100 cm³ is 0.1 L. So concentration c = 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M.

But wait, Fe^3+ hydrolyzes. The hydrolysis reaction is: Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. The K for this reaction is the hydrolysis constant. I think for Fe^3+, the hydrolysis constant is around 1e-31? Wait, that seems too small. Alternatively, maybe the hydrolysis constant is K = Kw / Kf, where Kf is the formation constant of Fe(OH)3. Hmm, I might not remember the exact value, but I think for Fe^3+, the hydrolysis leads to a pH around 2 or 3.

Wait, let me think again. The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M. The hydrolysis reaction will produce H+ ions. Let's denote x as the concentration of H+ produced. Then, the expression for the hydrolysis constant K is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+][H2O]^3

But since [H2O] is roughly constant, it's often omitted, so K ≈ [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But I need to find K for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid or base. Since Fe^3+ is the conjugate acid of a weak base (Fe(OH)3), its solution will be acidic.

The hydrolysis can be considered as:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

Wait, maybe that's a better way to model it with two steps, but perhaps for simplicity, we can model it as a single step. Let me think about the K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. I remember that for Fe^3+, the hydrolysis constant is very small, but I might have to look for an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula for a weak acid. If the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ produces H+ ions, we can model it as a weak acid with concentration c, where the initial concentration is 0.00936 M. The dissociation is Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ (simplified). The K for this can be found from the Kf of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the formation constant Kf for Fe(OH)3 is the equilibrium constant for Fe^3+ + 3OH- ↔ Fe(OH)3. So Kf = [Fe(OH)3]/([Fe^3+][OH-]^3). 

But I'm trying to find the hydrolysis constant K_h for Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)3 + H+ (which is the reverse of the base accepting H+). Wait, no.
