Okay, so I've got this problem about three spins and I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let's think through this.

Alright, the problem says each spin S1, S2, S3 can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So each pair contributes a term. Since J is probably a coupling constant, I think it's either positive or negative depending on whether the spins align.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Because each state contributes a Boltzmann factor. So I need to consider all possible combinations of the three spins and calculate E for each, then sum up exp(-βE) for all of them.

Each spin has two possible states, so the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. Let's list all possible states and calculate E for each.

First, I'll represent each spin as +1 or -1. Let me list all possibilities:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now, for each state, compute E.

The energy is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So each product S_i S_j is the product of their spins.

Let's go through each state:

1. All spins +1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum 1-1-1 = -1. E= -J*(-1) = J.
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum -1+1-1 =-1. E=J.
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum -1-1+1 =-1. E=J.
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum -1-1+1=-1. E=J.
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum -1+1-1=-1. E=J.
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum 1-1-1=-1. E=J.
8. All spins -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum 3. E=-3J.

Wait, so looking at the energies:

- States 1 and 8 have E = -3J.
- The other 6 states have E= J.

So the partition function Z is the sum of exp(-β E) for each state.

But wait, each state contributes exp(-β E_i), right? So for each state, calculate exp(β * E_i) because E is negative.

Wait, no. Because E is negative, so -β E would be positive.

Wait, let me clarify: The energy E for state 1 is -3J. So the Boltzmann factor is exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J). Similarly, for states 2-7 (E=J), the factor is exp(-β*(J))=exp(-β J). And for states 1 and 8: exp(3β J).

So how many states have E=-3J? Two states, as states 1 and 8.

And the remaining 6 states have E=J, so their factor is exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 * exp(3β J) + 6 * exp(-β J).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ). That would be if the energy was +3J for those two states. But in our case, the two states have E = -3J, so their factor is e^(3Jβ), which is what I have in Z.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ)
Option B: 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ)
Option C: 2e^(2Jβ) +6e^(-2Jβ)
Option D: 6e^(2Jβ) +2e^(-2Jβ)

So according to my calculation, Z is 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}, which matches option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I get the signs correct?

E is -3J for states 1 and 8, so exp(-β*(-3J)) is exp(3β J). For the other 6 states, E is J, so exp(-β J).

Yes, that's correct. So Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}, which is option B.


To determine the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), we start by noting that each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right),
\]

where \( J \) is the coupling constant. The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible states:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

Each spin has two possible states, so there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) total states. We calculate the energy \( E \) for each state by evaluating \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), then compute the corresponding Boltzmann factor \( e^{-\beta E} \).

### Energy Calculations
1. **State 1**: \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \)
   - \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \)
   - \( E = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J \)
   - Boltzmann factor: \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3\beta J} \)

2. **State 2**: \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \)
   - \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \)
   - \( E = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J \)
   - Boltzmann factor: \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J} \)

3. **State 3**: \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \)
   - \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \)
   - \( E = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J \)
   - Boltzmann factor: \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J} \)

4. **State 4**: \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \)
   - \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \)
   - \( E = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J \)
   - Boltzmann factor: \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J} \)

5. **State 5**: \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \)
   - \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \)
   - \( E = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J \)
   - Boltzmann factor: \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J} \)

6. **State 6**: \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \)
   - \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \)
   - \( E = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J \)
   - Boltzmann factor: \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J} \)

7. **State 7**: \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \)
   - \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \)
   - \( E = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J \)
   - Boltzmann factor: \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J} \)

8. **State 8**: \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \)
   - \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \)
   - \( E = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J \)
   - Boltzmann factor: \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3\beta J} \)

### Partition Function
From the above, we observe:
- Two states (States 1 and 8) have \( E = -3J \), contributing \( 2e^{3\beta J} \).
- The remaining six states (States 2–7) have \( E = J \), contributing \( 6e^{-\beta J} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Matching with Options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed for the \( -3J \) terms).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the exponents are doubled).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the exponents are doubled and the coefficients are swapped).

The correct answer is **Option B**.
