Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let me take it step by step. 

First, the molecular formula of the compound is C8H9NO. Hmm, the molecular formula can give me an idea about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to understand the possible functional groups.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:
DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2
Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens (which I don't see here), and N is nitrogens.

So plugging in the numbers:
C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1 (assuming O is considered as X=0 here, since it's not a halogen).
Wait, wait. The formula is C8H9NO. So yes, N is 1. So,

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5.

So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU, since a benzene ring is 3 double bonds equivalent), a carbonyl group (1 DoU), and maybe a double bond or another ring. Wait, 3 (benzene) +1 (carbonyl) +1 (another double bond) = 5. So maybe a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl and possibly a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H-NMR is given as:

9.72 (t, 1H),
6.98 (d, 2H),
6.51 (d, 2H),
6.27 (bs, 2H),
3.66 (d, 2H).

Hmm, let's interpret each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H, so if it's an aldehyde, that fits. But the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and don't split much because of the electronegative environment. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton, like an enol or something else. Hmm, but I'm thinking aldehyde for now.

The next peak is at 6.98 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H. That's probably part of an aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. But wait, in a para substitution, each proton would have two equivalent neighbors, but maybe it's a meta substitution? Or perhaps a coupling with another group.

Then, 6.51 ppm, another doublet for 2H. Maybe the other set of aromatic protons. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents? Wait, but how does that fit with the rest.

Then, 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange or coupling with multiple protons. Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like an enol or an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. The singlet could mean that the protons are equivalent and don't have neighboring Hs splitting them. Or perhaps they're in a position where they're not adjacent to any others, but wait, that's hard to imagine for 2H. Alternatively, maybe they are adjacent to two equivalent protons each, making them a singlet.

The last peak is at 3.66 ppm, a doublet for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. It could be an OCH2 group, like an ether or an ester, but given the molecular formula, more likely an alcohol or an ether. Wait, but the molecular formula has an O, so maybe it's an alcohol or part of a carbonyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, maybe a carbonyl group, and a conjugated system with some CH2 groups.

Wait, the starting material's formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. The NMR suggests an aldehyde group (the 9.72 ppm peak), so maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde derivative. But looking at the options, the products after the reactions are various enals or butenals. Let me think about the reactions.

The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

Hmm, those are typical conditions for a diazotization, followed by hydrolysis and then some kind of elimination or decomposition.

Wait, NaNO2 and HCl are for diazotization—usually done with anilines to form diazonium salts. Then, the diazonium salt can undergo various reactions. For example, hydrolysis (maybe under acidic or basic conditions) could yield a phenol or something else. But in this case, after step 2 with H2O, and then step 3 with KOH and heat—maybe it's a hydrolysis to form a phenol, followed by some elimination reaction, like formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about each step:

Step 1: Diazotization. So, if the starting compound has an aromatic amine group, it would form a diazonium salt. But wait, the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest an amine. Oh wait, but the molecular formula includes an N, so perhaps the starting material has an amine group. But in the NMR, maybe it's part of a substituent that's de-shielded but not visible as a peak because it's a very short lived group. Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is an aniline derivative.

Wait, looking at the NMR, maybe the aromatic protons are part of a para-substituted ring. The 6.98 and 6.51 peaks could be from two adjacent substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substitution.

Wait, another thought: the 6.27 peak (broad singlet, 2H) could be a pair of protons adjacent to an oxygen, like a CH2O group. Or maybe it's
