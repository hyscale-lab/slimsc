Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then predicting the product after a series of reactions with specific reagents. Hmm, I remember that NMR spectroscopy is key in determining the structure of organic compounds. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So DoU formula is (2*8 + 2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5. Wait, that's not possible because DoU should be an integer. Oh, maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh wait, right, the formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, in this case, X (halogens) is zero. So 2*8 +2 = 18, minus H (9) is 9, minus X (0), plus N (1) gives 10. So 10 divided by 2 is 5. Oh right, that makes sense. So five degrees of unsaturation. Each DoU can be a ring or a double bond. So five could be like two rings and a double bond, or one ring and three double bonds, etc. But since the compound is organic, probably a benzene ring (which accounts for three DoU) plus others.

Looking at the NMR data: 1H NMR (ppm): 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let me try to interpret this.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. Wait, or maybe another possibility. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton in a meta position, but that might not explain the triplet. Alternatively, maybe an enol tautomer? Hmm, but the question is about the product after reactions, so maybe I should first find out what the starting material is.

The NMR shows a triplet at ~9.7. Let's think: aldehyde would be a triplet? Or maybe a vinyl proton? Wait, a triplet suggests two neighboring protons. So if it's an aldehyde, perhaps it's attached to a CH2 group. Or maybe a vinylogous situation.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The 6.98 (d) is likely the two protons ortho to substituents, and 6.51 (d) could be the other two on the ring? Wait, but para-substituted would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that's a benzene ring with two substituents? Or maybe one substituent that's a di-substituted group. Wait, maybe it's two benzene rings connected. For example, a biphenyl structure, but more likely each substituent has an aromatic ring.

Wait, the 6.27 (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton, but it's 2H. Or maybe conjugated protons like in an enol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted aromatic ring where the protons are in a conjugated system, but I'm not sure.

The 3.66 (d, 2H) is a doublet, integrating to 2H. This could be a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like oxygen. For example, a CH2-O group. Or perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Putting this together: maybe the structure has a benzene ring connected via a chain that includes an aldehyde group, some CH2 groups, and another aromatic ring. Let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Breaking it down, perhaps two benzene rings (6 carbons) plus a three-carbon chain with an aldehyde and some substituents.

Wait, but if it's two benzene rings, that would be 6 carbons, leaving 2 more. Hmm, but the formula is C8. So C8 is 8 carbons. Two benzene rings have 6, so the remaining two carbons would be in another group. Let me see: the NMR shows peaks that might suggest a benzene ring (as in the 6.98 and 6.51) and another aromatic ring perhaps in the 6.27 region. But that's 2H, so maybe a di-substituted ring or a vinyl group.

Wait, the peak at 6.27 ppm (2H, broad s) could be part of a conjugated system, like an enol or a diene. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent on the benzene ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene in a position that's more deshielded.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative. The 9.72 ppm is the aldehyde proton. If it's a triplet, that suggests it's next to a CH2 group. So maybe RCHO, where R is a CH2-something.

Looking again, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. If that's a CH2 group next to something like an oxygen, perhaps an ether or ester. Or maybe it's part of a carbonyl group. Wait, but the formula has an O, so that could be an aldehyde, ether, ester, etc.

Another approach: think about the reagents used in the reaction. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually a nitrous acid (HNO2) condition. Nitrous acid is used for diazotization, typically of aromatic amines (aniline derivatives). So the starting compound probably has an amino group (-NH2) because that's what reacts with NaNO2 and HCl to form a diazonium salt. So the starting material must have an aromatic amine.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If that's the case, then the starting compound has an -NH2 group. Let's see: C8H9NO implies that the molecule has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. If it's an aniline derivative, then the NH2 is on a benzene ring.

So maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an -NH2 group. Or perhaps a diphenyl compound with an amino group and an aldehyde.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peak around 7.2-7.5 ppm, which is typical for an aniline proton. Or does it? Looking back, the NMR has a peak at 9.72, which is higher than typical aniline, which is around 7.5. So maybe that's an aldehyde. So perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amino group attached to a benzene ring.

Wait,
