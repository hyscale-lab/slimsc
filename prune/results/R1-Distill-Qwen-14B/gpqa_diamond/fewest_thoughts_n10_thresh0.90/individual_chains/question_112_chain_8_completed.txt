Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, that's the state vector, right? But it's not normalized yet, I think. So first, I need to normalize it because probabilities depend on the norm.

So, to find the normalization factor, I should compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself and then take the square root of the magnitude. The state is given as |alpha> proportional to a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2 - i).

The inner product <alpha|alpha> would be a* a + b* b. Let me compute that.

a* is (1 - i), right? Because the complex conjugate of (1+i) is 1-i. Similarly, b* is (2 + i).

So, a* a is (1 - i)(1 + i) = 1^2 + (i)(-i) + ... Wait, wait. Let me compute it properly. (1 - i)(1 + i) = 1*(1) + 1*(i) -i*(1) - i*(i) = 1 + i -i -i². Since i² is -1, so it becomes 1 +0 +1 = 2.

Similarly, b* b is (2 + i)(2 - i) = 4 - (i)^2? Wait, no, it's (2)(2) + (2)(-i) + i(2) + i*(-i). Let's compute each term: 4 - 2i + 2i - i². The -2i and +2i cancel out, and -i² is +1. So 4 + 1 =5.

So the total inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7), which means the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question says |alpha> is proportional to that, so I guess I need to normalize it. So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] divided by sqrt(7).

Now the next part is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator whose matrix is given. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so the matrix for A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

Wait, the spin operator in the z-basis has diagonal elements, but this operator is different. Let me think about what this operator represents. The standard Pauli matrices might be similar. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Pauli Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. But our matrix A is all off-diagonal elements as hbar/2, so maybe it's similar to the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2.

Wait, the operator A is a 2x2 matrix like this:
[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

So its eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI) =0. So determinant of [[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]] is zero.

Which gives λ² - (hbar²/4) =0 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues come from solving (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0. So λ² - (hbar^2/4) =0 → λ = ± hbar/2. So each eigenstate corresponds to either +hbar/2 or -hbar/2. 

But the problem says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Wait, the eigenstates of A are |+> and |->, which correspond to the eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively. So I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvectors of A. Let me think. For the eigenvalue +hbar/2, the equation (A - (+hbar/2) I) |v> =0.

The matrix (A - (+hbar/2) I) is:
[ [-hbar/2, hbar/2 ],
  [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ] ]

The equations become:
- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v1 = v2.
So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of [1,1]^T. To normalize, we can divide by sqrt(2), so |+> is 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down>).

Similarly, for the eigenvalue -hbar/2, the matrix (A - (-hbar/2)I) becomes:
[ [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ],
  [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ] ]

The equations are (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvector is [1, -1]^T, normalized to 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of these eigenstates and take the square of the magnitude.

Wait, but |alpha> is already in the |up> and |down> basis. So let me write |alpha> as ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) |down>.

Expressed as a vector, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Now, the eigenstate |+> is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]^T. The inner product < + | alpha > is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ] multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So that's [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Let me compute numerator: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 +0i → 3.

So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

The probability is the square of the magnitude. The magnitude is |3|/(sqrt(14)) → 3/sqrt(14).

So probability P1 is (9)/(14).

Wait, 3^2 is 9, denominator (sqrt(14))^2 is 14. So P1=9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 as one of the probabilities. But let's check another option.

Now for the eigenstate |->, which is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) ]^T. The inner product < - | alpha > is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Compute numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i + i) = -1 + 2i.

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So the two probabilities sum to 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36. That matches option A's first two numbers, 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value (expectation value) of the operator A. The expectation value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is a normalized state, the expectation value can be found by expanding the matrix elements.

But perhaps a smarter way is to use the fact that A is a Hermitian operator, and its eigenvalues are known. Since the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2, the expectation value is the sum of eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2).

Compute that:

= [ (9/14 -5/14) ) * hbar/2 ]

= (4/14) * hbar/2

= (2/7) * (hbar/2) → hbar/7.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate.

9/14 * (hbar/2) = (9 hbar)/(28)
5/14 * (hbar/2) = (5 hbar)/(28)
Total: (9-5) hbar/(28) =4 hbar/28 = hbar/7. So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7. So option A's expectation is hbar/7. That matches.

So the probabilities are 0.64, 0.36 and the average is hbar/7. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me cross-check the expectation value calculation another way to be sure.

Another approach: the expectation value <A> is given by the sum over i and j of (alpha_i^* alpha_j) A_ij.

Wait, the matrix A is as follows:

A = [ [0, hbar/2 ],
        [hbar/2, 0 ] ]

So <A> is the sum of |alpha_1|^2 * A_11 + |alpha_2|^2 * A_22 + alpha_1^* alpha_2 A_12 + alpha_2^* alpha_1 A_21.

But A_11=0, A_22=0, so <A> = alpha_1^* alpha_2 (hbar/2) + alpha_2^* alpha_1 (hbar/2).

Which can be written as (hbar/2) [ alpha_1^* alpha_2 + alpha_2^* alpha_1 ].

But alpha_1 is (1+i)/sqrt(7), alpha_2 is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So compute alpha_1^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7), alpha_2^* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So alpha_1^* alpha_2 = (1-i)(2 -i)/(7) → compute numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i². i² is -1, so 2-3i -1 → 1-3i.

Similarly, alpha_2^* alpha_1 = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7. Let's compute numerator: 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 + 2i +i +i² → 2 +3i -1 → 1+3i.

So adding these two together: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) → since denominator is 7, because each term was divided by 7. Wait, wait, when I compute alpha_1^* alpha_2, it's (1-i)(2 -i) =1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) → 2 -i -2i +i² → 2-3i-1=1-3i. Then divide by 7. Same goes for the other term: 1+3i, divided by 7.

So alpha_1^* alpha_2 = (1-3i)/7, and alpha_2^* alpha_1 = (1+3i)/7. Adding them gives (1-3i +1+3i)/7 = 2/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7. So yes, that confirms the earlier calculation.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator with matrix representation A, where A_ij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of the operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α>
The state |α> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize it, compute the inner product <α|α>:
- a = 1+i, so a* = 1-i; |a|² = (1-i)(1+i) = 2.
- b = 2-i, so b* = 2+i; |b|² = (2+i)(2-i) = 5.
- The norm is √(2 + 5) = √7. Thus, the normalized state is:
  \[
  |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down\rangle.
  \]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \hbar/2 \\
\hbar/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
Its eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λI) = 0, giving λ = ±ħ/2. The corresponding eigenstates are:
- |+⟩ = (|up⟩ + |down⟩)/√2 for eigenvalue +ħ/2,
- |−⟩ = (|up⟩ - |down⟩)/√2 for eigenvalue -ħ/2.

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
To find the probabilities of measuring |+⟩ and |−⟩, compute the inner products of |α⟩ with |+⟩ and |−⟩:
- For |+⟩:
  \[
  \langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}\right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
  \]
  The probability is:
  \[
  P(+|\alpha) = \left|\langle +|\alpha\rangle\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
  \]
- For |−⟩:
  \[
  \langle −|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}\right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
  \]
  The probability is:
  \[
  P(-|\alpha) = \left|\langle −|\alpha\rangle\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
  \]

### Step 4: Average value of the operator A
The expectation value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using the eigenvalues and their probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14}\cdot\frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14}\cdot\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14}\cdot\frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is ħ/7. This matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
