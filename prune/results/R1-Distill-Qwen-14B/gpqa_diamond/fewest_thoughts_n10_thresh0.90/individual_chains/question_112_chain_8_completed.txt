Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's start by breaking down what's given and what needs to be found.

The problem states that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that when something is proportional, I need to normalize it. So first, I should probably normalize this state because probabilities are based on normalized states.

Wait, what's the operator we're dealing with? Oh right, the operator has matrix elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that matrix structure is interesting. So for a two-level system, the matrix would look like [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Oh wait, no, wait: because if i is not j, then A_ij is ħ/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. That's a spin-like operator, maybe similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply it by ħ/2, you get the A_ij structure here.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices are usually used in the context of spin operators, like S_x, S_y, S_z. But this operator A might be similar to the spin-x operator, but scaled by ħ/2 instead of 1/2. Because Pauli matrices are 2x2, so for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are (ħ/2) * Pauli matrices. So yeah, operator A is the spin-x operator, maybe.

Wait, no. Because the spin-x operator is (ħ/2) σ_x. And σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So our operator A would be (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is exactly what A_ij is. So operator A is the spin-x operator. So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the |+x> and |-x> states.

But the question is about measuring the state |alpha> in the eigenstates of operator A. So essentially, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says, "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator". So the operator's eigenstates are the states in which we can measure. Since the operator is A, which is σ_x scaled by ħ/2, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it by diagonalizing the operator A, finding its eigenstates, and then projecting the given state |alpha> onto these eigenstates to find the probabilities.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's take it step by step.

First, let's normalize the given state |alpha>.

The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

So |alpha> = C [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], where C is the normalization constant.

The normalization condition is |C|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 ] = 1.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So |alpha> is normalized with C = 1/sqrt(2 +5) = 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, we need to find the eigenstates of operator A. Since A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal, it's the same as the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

The eigenvalues of Pauli X are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which is ħ/2 and -ħ/2. But the question is about the eigenstates, so the eigenstates are the eigenvectors of A.

Wait, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenstates are the same as σ_x's eigenstates. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

The eigenstates of σ_x (and hence A) are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no. Let me remember correctly: the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -1. So yes, that's correct.

So, to find the probability of measuring the state |alpha> in each eigenstate, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>. The probabilities would be |<+x | alpha>|^2 and |< -x |alpha>|^2.

So let's compute these inner products.

First, express |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7).

Similarly, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Compute <+x | alpha>:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ) ] ] / sqrt(7)

Since <up|down> is zero, and <up|up> = <down|down> =1.

So this becomes:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ) ] ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1 + i + 2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (1/sqrt(2)) (3) ) ] / sqrt(7)
= 3/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

The probability is the square of the magnitude of this inner product.

So | <+x | alpha> |^2 = [ 3/(sqrt(14)) ) ]^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, 9/14 is about 0.642857... which is about 0.64. So that's one probability.

Now calculate the inner product for |−x>.

< -x | alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Again, <up|down> and <down|up> are zero. So:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 + i - 2 + i ) ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1 + 2i ) ] / sqrt(7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

So the probability is the square of the magnitude:

| ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14) |^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, wait, 5/14 is about 0.3571, but wait 9/14 is 0.642857 and 5/14 is 0.357142. Hmm, but in the options, the probabilities are given as 0.64, 0.36 and others. So the first probability is approximately 0.643, which rounds to 0.64. The second is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So that would give probabilities of about 0.64 and 0.36. Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.357, so 0.36 when rounded? Or maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me compute the inner product again for |−x>. Let me recheck.

Inner product < -x | alpha>:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*(-1) ] / sqrt(7)
Wait, no, the components are from <up| and <down|. So when you take ( <up| - <down| ) acting on ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ), you get:

(1+i) * <up|up> - (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down>

But <up|down> is zero, so:

= (1+i)*1 - (2 -i)*1

= (1 + i) - (2 - i) = (1-2) + (i +i) ) = (-1) + 2i.

So the numerator is (-1 + 2i), divided by sqrt(2) * sqrt(7). So the inner product is ( (-1 + 2i) ) / (sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / (14) = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14 ≈0.3571. So the first probability is approximately 0.64 and the second is approximately 0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but wait. 9 +5 is 14, which is correct because the probabilities should add to 1.

Now, the next part is finding the average value of the operator A. The average value is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since the operator A is diagonal in its eigenbasis, the average value can be calculated as the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.

So the average value would be (9/14)*(ħ/2) + (5/14)*(-ħ/2) )

So let me compute that:

= (9/14)( ħ/2 ) + (5/14)( - ħ/2 )
= [ (9 -5) / 14 ] * ħ/2
= (4/14) * ħ/2
= (2/7) * ħ/2
Wait that's (2/7) * ( ħ/2 ) = (2 * ħ ) / (7 * 2 ) = ħ /7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) Probabilities 0.64, 0.36; average hbar/7. 

But option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which matches our 9/14 (~0.6429) and 5/14 (~0.3571). So 0.64 and 0.36 are the probabilities, and average hbar/7. So option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So option A is a possible candidate.

Wait, but let me double-check the average value calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <A> directly using matrix elements.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is (1+i |up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

So in vector form, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Let me compute this step by step.

Matrix A is:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

So A multiplied by |alpha> is:

A|alpha> = [ (0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7), 
             (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= [ ( (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), ( (ħ/2)(1+i) ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

So, A|alpha> = [ ( (2 -i) ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7), ( (1+i) ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) ) ]^T

Now, compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ ( (2 -i) ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7), ( (1 +i) ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (2 -i) ħ/2 * (1/ sqrt(7)) ) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (1 +i) ħ/2 * (1/sqrt(7)) ) ]

Factor out ( ħ/(2*7) ) since sqrt(7)*sqrt(7) is 7.

So:

= [ (1-i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] * ħ/(2*7)

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i^2 = 2 -i -2i + (-1) = (2-1) + (-3i ) = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i^2 = 2 +2i +i + (-1) = (2-1) +3i = 1 +3i.

Adding these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i )= 2.

So the entire expression becomes (2) * ħ/(14) ) = 2 * ħ/(14) = ħ/7.

Which matches the earlier result. So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A is the first one: probabilities 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.

So the correct option would be A.

But wait, looking back at the options: 

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

So that's matching our calculations.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = C[(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle] \), where \( C \) is the normalization constant. The normalization condition is:

\[
|C|^2 \left( |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 \right) = 1.
\]

Compute \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \) and \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5 \). Thus:

\[
|C|^2 (2 + 5) = 1 \implies |C|^2 = \frac{1}{7} \implies C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is equivalent to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Thus, the eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
To find the probabilities, compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):

1. **Overlap with \( |+x\rangle \):**

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow| + \langle \downarrow| \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(+x) = |\langle +x|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

2. **Overlap with \( |-x\rangle \):**

\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow| - \langle \downarrow| \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(-x) = |\langle -x|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2}}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]

Using the eigenvalues and probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substitute \( P(+x) = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P(-x) = \frac{5}{14} \):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively. The average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
