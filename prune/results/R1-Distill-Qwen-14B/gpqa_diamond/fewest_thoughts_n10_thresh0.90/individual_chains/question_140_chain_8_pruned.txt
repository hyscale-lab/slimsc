Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius since water freezes at 273 K (0°C). So B is probably something that melts just above freezing. Also, the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. Let me break this down. I think I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Once I have that, I can work out their elements and find the cumulative atomic masses in X.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with liquid Y. Violent reactions often involve things like metals reacting with acids, perhaps. Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Since a molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons, the simplest case is when it's a noble gas because they have complete electron shells, but maybe not. Alternatively, if the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like H2O (but no, H2O has H with 1 proton and O with 8, so that's not equal). Wait, maybe it's CO2? No, CO2 has 22 neutrons (12 for C, 16 for O times 2). Wait, the molecule's atoms must each have the same number of protons and neutrons? Or the molecule as a whole?

Wait, the question says the molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait, no. It says 'the same number of neutrons and protons.' So for the molecule, the total protons equals the total neutrons. For example, if W is H2, then total protons are 2 (each H has 1), and total neutrons are 0 (since H has 0 neutrons). That's not equal. What about O2? O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That works. So W could be O2, but then Y would probably be something that produces oxygen gas. Alternatively, maybe W is something like NH3? No, because the molecule would have N (14,7 neutrons) and H (1,0 neutrons). Wait, maybe W is CH4? No, because the total protons would be 1 (C) +4 (H) =5, and neutrons would depend on isotopes. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, looking for a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. For example, each atom in W has equal protons and neutrons. That would mean each atom is, say, carbon-12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons) or oxygen-16 (8 each). So if W is CO2, each C has 6,6 and each O has 8,8. But then the molecule's total protons would be 6 (C) + 16 (2 O) =22, neutrons would be 6 (C) + 16 (2 O) =22. So yes, W could be CO2. Hmm, but what reaction would produce CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid. Or perhaps a metal reacting, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is CH4. Each carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (but wait, that's only if it's carbon-12; heavier isotopes have more neutrons). But if W's molecule has each atom with equal protons and neutrons, then the possible candidates are atoms like C, O, or perhaps something else.

Wait, but let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. That's about 4°C. So B is probably something that melts around there. Common substances that melt around 0°C include ice (but higher if it's salted), but perhaps something else. Wait, maybe B is water? Because ice melts at 0°C (273 K), but the problem says 277 K which is 4°C. Hmm, maybe B is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's NH4Cl, but that's more around 337 K (164°C) as a melting point. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe something like camphor, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal with a low melting point. Wait, maybe it's not a metal. Alternatively, perhaps B is an oxide or something else.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible reactions. If X reacts with Y to produce a gas W and a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. Maybe X is a metal and Y is an acid. For example, a metal reacting with an acid to produce hydrogen gas. But then W would be H2. Does H2 have the same number of protons and neutrons? H2 has two H atoms, each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So protons total 2, neutrons 0. Not the same. So W can't be H2. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something else.

Wait, if X is sodium (Na), and Y is water (H2O). Sodium reacts violently with water to produce sodium hydroxide (a precipitate?), hydrogen gas (H2). Wait, but when sodium reacts with water, it produces NaOH and H2. But would NaOH be a precipitate? No, because sodium hydroxide is soluble in water. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is another liquid, like sulfuric acid. But sodium reacts with sulfuric acid to produce Na2SO4, which is soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate reacting with an acid would produce CO2 gas, and a precipitate of the metal sulfate or something else. Wait, but what precipitate would form when a carbonate reacts with an acid? Maybe if Y is an acid, the carbonate would produce CO2, and the corresponding salt. For example, CaCO3 + HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. But in that case, the product is CaCl2, which is soluble. Hmm, so maybe X is a sulfide, which reacts with an acid to produce H2S gas? But H2S has 2 hydrogens (each 1p, 0n), and S has 16p, 16n (if it's 32S). So H2S has 2+16 =18 protons and 0+16=16 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W is CO gas. Each CO molecule has one C (6p, 6n) and one O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 6+8=14. Neutrons: 6+8=14. So W could be CO. But CO is a gas, and reactions producing CO aren't as common as CO2, but possible in some cases.

Wait, maybe W is CH4. Each CH4 has C (6p,6n) and H (1p,0n). So total protons: 6 +4 =10. Neutrons:6. So that doesn't equal. So that's not W.

Alternatively, perhaps W is C2H2 (acetylene). Each H has 1p, 0n. Each C has 6p,6n. So total protons: 2*6 + 2 =14. Neutrons: 2*6=12. Not equal. So that's no good.

Hmm. Maybe W is N2 gas. N has 7p,7n (if it's N-14). So each N has 7 each. So N2 would have 14p and 14n, which fits. So W could be N2. But then what reaction produces N2 gas? Maybe a decomposition reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps W is O2. Each O has 8p and 8n (O-16). So O2 would have 16p and 16n. That would fit. So W is O2 gas. What reaction produces O2? Maybe a decomposition of a peroxide, or a reaction between a metal and water (like sodium, but that produces H2, not O2). Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate and Y is a strong acid, but that produces CO2.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a peroxide, like H2O2. If X is something that reacts with H2O2, maybe a metal, producing O2. But I'm not sure.
