Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. I'll take it slow because I don't want to miss anything important.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because I remember that 273 K is 0°C. So maybe B is some kind of solid that's just a bit above freezing.

The product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for having a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Hmm, wait, the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Oh, right, and if there are multiple instances, we have to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes.

Let me break this down. Let's think about what X could be. It's a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like KMnO4, K2Cr2O7, or maybe something like H2SO4, but wait, those might not fit the other clues.

Wait, when X reacts with a liquid Y, which I'm thinking is maybe water or another solvent. The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So, the molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. For example, H2O: but no, because H has 0 neutrons, O has 8, so not equal. Maybe CH4? But that's a gas but not sure about the protons and neutrons. Alternatively, CO2? No, same issue. Wait, maybe it's something like NH3? Let's see: NH3. Each molecule has 1 N and 3 H. Nitrogen has 7 neutrons (since atomic number 7, mass number 14 for N-14, which is common). So, wait, in NH3, each molecule has 1 N (protons 7, neutrons 7 for N-14) and 3 H (each with 0 neutrons). So the total protons in the molecule: 7 (N) + 3*1 (H) = 10 protons. Neutrons: 7 (from N) + 3*0 = 7. Wait, but the problem says the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So for NH3, protons would be 10 and neutrons 7. Doesn't match. Maybe another gas.

Wait, maybe it's CO. Let's see: CO has one C and one O. C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So the molecule has 14 protons (6+8) and 14 neutrons (6+8). Yes, that matches—so W is CO. So the gas released is carbon monoxide.

So the reaction between X and Y produces CO. What else happens? There's a precipitate G that forms. When G is heated, it releases B, and B's melting point is close to 277 K (which is 4°C). So B is a solid that just melts around 4°C. Hmm, what's a solid that melts at 4°C? Water (ice) would be 273 K, but it's 277, which is a bit higher. Maybe something else. Alternatively, is there a solid that's a bit higher, maybe a salt that's melting around that temperature?

Wait, another thought: when a solution of some metal salt is treated with a base, a precipitate can form. For example, if Y is a base like NaOH, and X could be a metal salt. Let me think. Suppose X is a metal with a higher isotope. Wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So maybe X is a metal with a heavier isotope, like potassium or something else.

Wait, but let me consider the reaction. X reacts with Y (maybe a base) to produce CO. Wait, if Y is a base, and X is a metal carbonate, but no, because reaction with a base wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal nitrate, but that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, alternative approach: when X is a reagent used in organic chemistry, perhaps it's something like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7, which are strong oxidizing agents. But let me think about the reaction. If X is KMnO4, and Y is something like HCl, perhaps? Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product has two oxygen atoms. So the reaction between X and a keto acid produces a compound with two oxygen atoms. For example, if X is a base like NaOH, perhaps the keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) would react to form a salt. But the product has two oxygen atoms, which might suggest something like a carboxylate ion, which has O in the COO− group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. Then when G is heated, it releases B. Let me think about possible precipitates that upon heating release something. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating would release CO2, but earlier we thought W was CO. Hmm, maybe.

Wait
