Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I need to figure out which stars are observable by both instruments. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that each spectrograph has a different brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So, that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitude means brighter. So if the star's apparent magnitude is ≤ 17, ESPRESSO can see it.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the apparent V magnitude should be ≤ 16.

So any star that has an apparent V magnitude ≤16 can be seen by both HIRES and ESPRESSO, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17. But wait, no—because HIRES can only go to 16. So the star must be ≤16 in apparent V to be detected by both. Because if a star is brighter than 16 (like 15), then both can see it. But if it's, say, 16.5, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can.

Wait, I should clarify: The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO," which I think means m_V ≤17. Similarly, for HIRES, m_V ≤16.

So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both. Because if it's 16.5, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So we're looking for stars where m_V ≤16.

Now, let's look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. Wait, but do we know its apparent magnitude? Hmm. Let's calculate it. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs
