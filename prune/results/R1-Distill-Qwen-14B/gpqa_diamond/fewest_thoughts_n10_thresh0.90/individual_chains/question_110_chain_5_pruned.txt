Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, the question gives me five stars with various parameters, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both.

Let me read the question again. It says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V, which I think means apparent magnitude less than 17 because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Wait, no, wait. Wait, noâ€”apparent magnitude is how bright they appear from Earth. So a lower number is brighter. So if the instrument can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that probably means their apparent V magnitude is less than or equal to 17, because higher magnitudes are dimmer. Wait, no, hold on. If the instrument can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17, that would mean the apparent mag is less than 17. Because, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So, for ESPRESSO, a star must have V < 17 to be observed. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so their V must be <16 to be seen by HIRES.

So the stars that can be seen by both would have V magnitudes less than 16 because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16 (V <16), it's also brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So we need stars with V apparent mag <16.

Wait, but I also need to consider any extinction due to dust, which affects the apparent magnitude. The stars may have some interstellar absorption. Oh right, the V band extinction is calculated based on E(B-V). The formula is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the observed apparent magnitude would be the intrinsic (or absolute) magnitude plus this extinction.

Wait, no. Wait, correction: The apparent magnitude is the intrinsic magnitude plus extinction. Because if a star is behind dust, it appears dimmer, so higher apparent magnitude. For example, without extinction, a star with V=10 would appear as V=10. If there's extinction of Av=1 mag, it would become V=11.
