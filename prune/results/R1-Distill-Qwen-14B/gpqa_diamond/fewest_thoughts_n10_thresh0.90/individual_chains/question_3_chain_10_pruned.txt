Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem states that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

Hmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product of the state with the operator. So, for an operator A, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩.

Let me break down the operator into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. Since expectation values are linear, I can calculate each part separately and then add them together.

First, let's tackle the expectation value of σz, then multiply by 10. The given state is a superposition, but |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, which should make things easier.

Wait, the state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me write it as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. I should check if this is a normalized state. The sum of squares of the amplitudes should be 1. So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Yep, it's normalized.

The expectation value of σz is ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩. Since σz acting on |↑⟩ gives +1, and on |↓⟩ gives -1. So, let me compute this:

⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩ = |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1).

Because when you apply σz to |↑⟩, you get +1 * |↑⟩, and for |↓⟩, you get -1 * |↓⟩.

So plugging in the values:
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25,
|b|^2 = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the expectation value for 10σz would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto the σx part. The operator σx is a bit trickier because its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Instead, they are the spin states in the x-direction, |+x⟩ and |-x⟩. But since the given state is a combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, I'll need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ directly.

I remember that σx can be represented as a matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply σx to |↑⟩, which is [1,0]^T, you get [0,1]^T = |↓⟩. Similarly, applying σx to |↓⟩ gives |↑⟩.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value using the coefficients a and b.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by the sum over the terms. For a spin-1/2 system in state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is 2 * Re(ab^*), but wait, I think I might be mixing some formulas here.

Wait, another approach: since σx is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|), then ⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ| (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) |ψ⟩.

Substituting ψ, this becomes [a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓| ] (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) [a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩].

Expanding this out, let's see:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = a* a ⟨↑|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + a* b ⟨↑|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + b* b ⟨↓|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩?

Wait, maybe it's better to compute each term step by step.

So, let me better compute it as:

⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

But I know that σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So the matrix elements can be computed.

So, ⟨↑| σx |↑⟩ = ⟨↑| ↓ ⟩ = 0.

Similarly, ⟨↓| σx |↓⟩ = 0.

Now, ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ = ⟨↑| ↑ ⟩ = 1.

Similarly, ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ = ⟨↓| ↓ ⟩ = 1.

Wait, no, wait: σx |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, so ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ = ⟨↑| |↑⟩ = 1.

Similarly, ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ = ⟨↓| |↓⟩ = 1.

So putting it all together:

⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * 0 + a b* *1 + a* b *1 + |b|^2 * 0.

Which simplifies to a b* + a* b.

But wait, a and b are real numbers here, right? Because the given coefficients are real. Let me check: 0.5 is real, sqrt(3)/2 is real. So a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

So a b* is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330.

Similarly, a* b is the same as a b, since a and b are real. So a* b = (sqrt(3))/4.

So adding them together: 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ ≈ 0.866. But wait, let me compute it exactly. a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

a b = (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. So a b + a b = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the expectation value of σx is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254.

Wait, but that's about 0.866. So the 5σx part would contribute 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Now, the total expectation value is the sum of the two parts: 10σz gives -5, and 5σx gives approximately 4.33.

So total expectation value is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because sqrt(3)/2 is exactly approximately 0.8660254, so 5 times that is about 4.330127.

So adding -5 and +4.330127 gives -0.669873. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculation for σx. Another approach is to represent ψ as a vector and compute the expectation value.

Since |↑⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0,1]^T, the state ψ is a vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The operator σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value is ψ† σx ψ.

Calculating this as:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

First, compute σx ψ:

σx ψ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Now, take the conjugate transpose of ψ (which, since the coefficients are real, is just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]) and multiply by this vector:

⟨σx⟩ = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4 ) + (sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2
