Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about oxygen acting as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, both thermodynamically and kinetically. Hmm, I remember that the strength of an oxidant has to do with its tendency to get reduced. So in basic solutions, is oxygen a stronger oxidant than in acidic?

Wait, I think about the standard reduction potentials. In acidic solution, the reduction of oxygen is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, which has a standard E of around +1.23 V. In basic solution, the same reaction would involve OH- instead. So the reaction would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-, which I think has a lower E°, maybe around +0.4 V. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The E° for the basic solution would be different because the pH is different. But wait, the standard potentials are measured under standard conditions, which are usually 1 M concentrations, and for aqueous solutions, that's pH 0 for acidic and pH 14 for basic, I think. So in acidic conditions, the E° is higher, meaning it's a stronger oxidizing agent. But wait, the question is about thermodynamics, so whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

Wait, I'm getting confused. The standard E for O2 in acidic is higher, so it's a stronger oxidant in acidic. So in basic, maybe it's a weaker oxidant? Because the E° is lower? So thermodynamically, in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant compared to acidic conditions. So the first blank would be 'weaker' in basic.

Now for the kinetic part: how fast does oxygen react in acidic versus basic solutions. Kinetics depends on the reaction rate, which is influenced by factors like pH and the presence of catalysts.

I recall that in acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 (like in corrosion or oxidation reactions) can be faster because the H+ ions help in the reaction mechanism. For example, in the hydrogen electrode, H+ is involved. Also, in acidic conditions, the reaction might proceed through a different pathway that's more efficient, leading to a faster reaction. Whereas in basic solutions, maybe the reaction is slower because OH- ions are present, which might not facilitate the reaction as much.

Wait, but wait, another angle: the rate of the reaction might also depend on the concentration of ions. For example, in acidic solutions, there are more H+ ions, which can act as catalysts. Maybe the reaction involves H+ in the rate-determining step. So if O2 is reacting in acidic solution, the H+ helps the reaction proceed more quickly. So in acidic, the reaction is faster; in basic, it's slower. So the second blank is 'faster' in acidic.

Putting it together: thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions (since the E° is lower). And kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions because the reaction is more favorable and the conditions (like H+ ions) facilitate a quicker reaction.

Looking at the options:

A) stronger – faster → No, because in basic it's weaker, acidic is faster.

B) stronger – slower → No, because in basic, weaker.

C) weaker – faster → Yes, because thermodynamic part is weaker in basic, and kinetic in acidic is faster.

D) weaker – slower → No, because in acidic, it's faster.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the thermodynamic part. The standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic is +1.23 V. In basic solution, the same reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH- with a standard E° of +0.401 V. So the E is lower in basic. A lower E means it's a weaker oxidant. So in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant. So the first part is 'weaker'.

So the first part is correct as 'weaker', and the second part is 'faster' in acidic.

So the combination is weaker and faster. Looking back at the options, option C is 'weaker – faster'. So the correct answer should be C: weaker – faster.

Wait, but let me think about kinetics again. Does the reaction actually proceed faster in acidic conditions? Because sometimes, even if thermodynamically more favorable, the kinetics can be different. For example, activation energy might be lower in acidic conditions. For instance, for the rusting of iron, in acidic conditions, the reaction is faster because H+ ions help in the electron transfer. So yes, in acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 is faster.

So the correct option is C: weaker and faster.


The question involves analyzing the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, both thermodynamically and kinetically. 

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**:  
   The standard reduction potential for the reaction of oxygen in acidic solutions is higher (+1.23 V) compared to its potential in basic solutions (+0.401 V). A higher reduction potential indicates a stronger oxidant. Therefore, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Analysis**:  
   Kinetic factors, such as the presence of H⁺ ions in acidic solutions, facilitate faster reaction rates. H⁺ ions can act as catalysts, lowering the activation energy and making the reaction proceed more quickly. In contrast, OH⁻ ions in basic solutions do not facilitate the reaction as effectively, leading to a slower reaction rate. Thus, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions and slower in basic solutions.

3. **Combining Results**:  
   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions, and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions. This matches the combination "weaker – faster."

4. **Evaluating Options**:  
   - **A) stronger – faster**: Incorrect, as oxygen is weaker in basic solutions.  
   - **B) stronger – slower**: Incorrect, as oxygen is weaker in basic solutions.  
   - **C) weaker – faster**: Correct, as explained above.  
   - **D) weaker – slower**: Incorrect, as oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Thus, the correct answer is **C) weaker – faster**.

Answer: C
