--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when a photon is absorbed. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

Alright, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. So the molecule is initially in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon that causes it to move to the next lowest energy state. 

First, I should remember what the fundamental state means. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for the system. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, there are vibrational and rotational energy levels. So the molecule has both vibrational and rotational energies.

Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy," which probably refers to the next higher energy state, maybe the first excited state. But I need to figure out what kind of transition this is—vibrational or rotational.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe is the ground state for both vibration and rotation. So for vibration, the ground state is n=0, and for rotation, it's the lowest rotational level, perhaps J=0 or J=1? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, no, the rigid rotor model has rotational states starting at J=0. But since this is a non-rigid rotor, maybe the vibrational and rotational energies are considered together.

Wait, in the vibration-rotation coupling model, the energy levels are a combination of vibrational and rotational states. The fundamental vibrational state is n=0, and the rotational state is J=0, I think. But the next state would involve either a vibrational transition or a rotational one.

But the question is about the photon being absorbed. So the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, the initial state is the fundamental state, so that's n=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy could be the next vibrational state (n=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). Which one has a lower energy? Hmm, that depends on the energy differences. 

I think in diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are more spaced out than the rotational ones. The vibrational energy spacing is much larger than rotational. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 would probably be higher than that between J=0 and J=1. So the lower energy transition might be a rotational one, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So it's the smallest possible energy increase. So if the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational, then the photon's energy would correspond to the rotational energy difference. But wait, in some cases, the fundamental state is the point where both are at their lowest, so the next possible transition might involve either.

Alternatively, perhaps the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be the next possible energy level, which could be either J=1 or n=1.

But wait, the energy levels are quantized, so the order depends on the specific molecule. For a diatomic molecule, the energy of the rotational state is given by E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + ½) h w, where w is the angular frequency.

So to find which transition requires less energy, I should compute the energy differences.

Wait, the initial state is n=0, J=0. The next state could be either n=0, J=1 or n=1, J=0.

Let me compute the energy differences for both possibilities.

For the vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1:

ΔE_vib = E(n=1) - E(n=0) = [ (1 + ½) h w ] - [ (0 + ½) h w ] = (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w.

For the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1:

ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = B (1)(2) - B (0)(1) = 2B.

So I need to compare h w and 2B. Whichever is smaller would require a lower energy photon.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the molecule is in a state where both vibrational and rotational transitions are possible, and the question is about the transition to the next state, regardless of type.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. So the photon's energy should match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

So first, I need to calculate both possible energy differences and see which is the case.

But to compute that, I need the values of B and h w.

Wait, given in the problem, they provide:

Mx = 20 amu (atomic mass units), My = 2 amu.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms.

Angular frequency w = 4e14 rad/s.

So perhaps I can compute the rotational constant B.

The rotational constant B is given by:

B = (h / (8 π² μ R² )) / (2), where μ is the reduced mass.

Wait, no. Wait, the rotational constant B is h/(8 π² μ R² c), but wait, no, that's for spectroscopic terms. Wait, no. Let me think. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is h/(8 π² I), and I is the moment of inertia.

So I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So B = h/(8 π² I) = h/(8 π² μ R²).

So let me compute B.

First, compute μ, the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert this to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

Now, compute I = μ R²: which is 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Then B = h/(8 π² I).

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So let's compute the denominator: 8 π² I.

8 * π² = 8 * (9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

78.9568 * I = 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 95.33e-46 → 9.533e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.533e-45 = approx 6.626e-34 / 9.533e-45.

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 / 9.533e-45 ≈ (6.626 / 9.533) * 1e11 → approx 0.695 * 1e11 = 6.95e10.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1e11 would be a huge value for B. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 8 π² I is 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2064e-46 → 78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 = 78.9568 * 1.2064 is about 95.33, so 95.33e-46 kg m². Wait, wait, no: 1.2064e-46 multiplied by 78.9568 is 1.2064 *78.9568 = approximately 95.33, so 95.33e-46 kg m². Hmm, 95.33e-46 is 9.533e-45 kg m².

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.533e-45 = 6.626e-34 / 9.533e-45 = (6.626 /9.533) * 1e11.

Wait, 6.626 /9.533 ≈ 0.695, so 0.695e11 = 6.95e10. So B ≈ 6.95e10 rad/s.

Wait, that's a very high value. Hmm, but let me think again: the rotational constant B is in cm^-1 usually, but here in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, no, the rotational energy is E_rot = B J(J+1), where B is in terms of energy per J(J+1). Hmm, perhaps I should have used the correct formula for B.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again. The rotational constant in terms of energy is B = (h²)/(8 π² I), but the energy E_rot is (h²/(8 π² I)) * J(J+1). Alternatively, sometimes B is given as h/(8 π² I c), which is in wavenumbers, but perhaps I should be using the correct units.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me recall the formula for the rotational energy levels. The energy is E_rot = (ħ² J(J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and I is the moment of inertia.

But ħ = h/(2 π), so E_rot = ( (h/(2 π))² J(J+1) ) / (2 I) ) = ( h² J(J+1) )/(8 π² I ).

But I = μ R², so substituting that gives E_rot = h² J(J+1)/(8 π² μ R²).

But the rotational constant B is (h^2)/(8 π² I) ) = h^2/(8 π² μ R²). So B is h^2/(8 π² μ R²).

Wait, but then the energy would be E_rot = B * J(J+1). So B is in units of energy per J(J+1), which would be in Joules.

Wait, but when you compute h/(8 π² I), that's in radians per second. Wait, perhaps I confused B with another term.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the rotational energy for J=0 and J=1.

Wait, but to find the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, I can compute ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0).

E(J)= (h²/(8 π² I)) * J(J+1).

So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (h²/(8 π² I)) * 2.

So ΔE_rot= 2 * (h²/(8 π² I)) ) = (h²/(4 π² I)).

Alternatively, I can compute the vibrational energy difference, which is from n=0 to n=1.

E_vib = h w (n + ½ ) - h w (0 + ½ ) = h w ( (n+1/2) - (0 +1/2) ) = h w n. For n=1, ΔE_vib = h w (1) = h w.

So the vibrational energy difference is h w = h * 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but in the problem statement, they give w as the angular frequency of vibration.

So let me compute both ΔE_rot and ΔE_vib.

First, compute ΔE_vib:

h = 6.626e-34 J s

w =4e14 rad/s.

ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now compute ΔE_rot.

Earlier, I computed B as 6.95e10 rad/s. Wait, I'm getting confused. Because B is in terms of angular frequency (rad/s), but the rotational energy is E = ħ^2 J(J+1)/(2I), which would be in Joules.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the rotational energy for J=1.

E_rot(J=1) = (ħ² * 1*(1+1)) ) / (2 I)

I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So ħ = h/(2 π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J s.

So E_rot(J=1) = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 * 2 ) / (2 * 1.2064e-46 )

Simplify denominator: 2 *1.2064e-46= 2.4128e-46.

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 *2 ≈ (1.112e-68) *2= 2.224e-68.

So E_rot = 2.224e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = approx 9.216e-23 J.

Wait, but that's the energy for J=1. The energy for J=0 is zero, so the difference ΔE_rot = 9.216e-23 J.

Comparing that to ΔE_vib = 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition requires about 9.2e-23 J, while the vibrational requires 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be via a rotational transition.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because 9.2e-23 J is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition is a much lower energy change. So the photon would have to match the rotational energy difference.

But wait, another thought: does the molecule's fundamental state include the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0)? If so, the next state could be either J=1 (same vibrational state) or n=1 (same rotational state). Which has the lower energy difference?

In our calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon would be in the rotational transition.

But wait, I thought the vibrational transitions require higher energy. So the next possible state is a rotational one.

So the photon's energy must match ΔE_rot =9.216e-23 J.

But the question is about momentum, not energy. So we need to find the photon's momentum p, given that energy E_photon = ΔE_rot.

The energy of a photon is E = pc, where p is the momentum, and c is the speed of light.

So p = E_photon / c.

Wait, let's compute that.

E_photon =9.216e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.216e-23 / 3e8 = 3.072e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are anywhere near 3e-31. Hmm, that's a problem. The options are all around 1e-27 to 2e-27.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of E_rot.

Let me recalculate E_rot for J=1.

E_rot = (ħ² * J (J+1)) / (2 I )

ħ = h/(2 π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

J=1, so J(J+1)=2.

I = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = (1.112e-68 * 2 )/(2 * 1.2064e-46 )

Wait, denominator: 2 * I = 2.4128e-46 kg m².

So numerator: 2 * 1.112e-68 = 2.224e-68.

E_rot = 2.224e-68 / 2.4128e-46 = approx 9.22e-23 J.

That's correct.

Now, E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

p = E/c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are in this range. The options are A) ~2e-28, B) ~2e-27, C) ~1e-27, D) ~1e-28.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake in my approach. Because the answer isn't matching any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I considered the wrong energy difference. Maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the lowest rotational state, and the next state is the same vibrational state but higher rotational, or perhaps a combination.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in the rotational-vibration spectrum, which is the combination of a vibrational and rotational transition. But that's more complicated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is in the lowest rotational state (J=0) but the fundamental vibrational state (n=0), and the next state is the first vibrational excited state (n=1) and J=0.

In that case, the energy difference is ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then the momentum p is ΔE/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is n=0, J=0. The next state could be n=0, J=1 (rotational transition), which requires less energy. But earlier calculations suggested that the rotational transition requires much less energy. But according to the options, the photon momentums are in the 1e-27 range, which would correspond to higher energies.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B differently. Let me recalculate B.

B is the rotational constant in terms of angular frequency, given by B = h/(8 π² I).

Wait, I was calculating I correctly as μ R². Let's recompute.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) )=40/22 amu ≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.016e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms= 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20=1.2064e-46 kg m².

h =6.626e-34 J s.

8 π² ≈78.9568.

So B = h/(8 π² I) = 6.626e-34 / (78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 )

Wait, 78.9568 *1.2064e-46 = approx 78.9568 *1.2064 is about 95.33, so 95.33e-46 = 9.533e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 / 9.533e-45 = approx 6.626e-34 /9.533e-45.

Dividing 6.626e-34 by 9.533e-45 is 6.626/9.533 = 0.695, and 1e11, so 0.695e11 = 6.95e10 rad/s.

Wait, that's a high value. So B is about 6.95e10 rad/s.

Then the rotational energy difference for J=1 is E_rot = B * J (J+1) = 6.95e10 * 2 =1.39e11 rad/s.

Wait, no, that's not correct. B is in rad/s, so E_rot is actually in terms of energy. Wait, no, no. Because E_rot (in J) is (h²/(8 π² I)) * J(J+1). Alternatively, since B = h/(8 π² I), then E_rot = B * (ħ^2 J(J+1)) / (2ħ) ??? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the energy in terms of B. Since B is h/(8 π² I), then E_rot = (h/(8 π² I)) * J (J+1) * (ħ²/(2 I)) )... No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I ). So E_rot = ( (h/(2π))^2 J (J+1) )/( 2 I )

Simplify: E_rot = h² J(J+1) / (8 π² I )

But I = μ R², so E_rot = h² J(J+1) / (8 π² μ R² )

Which can be written as E_rot = (h²/(8 π² μ R² )) * J(J+1) )

So the term (h²/(8 π² μ R² )) is B, so E_rot = B J (J+1)

B is in units of energy per J(J+1), perhaps in Joules.

Wait, h is in J s, so h² is J² s². μ is kg, R is meters. So denominator is kg m². So h²/(8 π² μ R² ) has units J² s²/(kg m²) → (kg² m² s^-2 s²) )/( kg m² )) → kg m² s^-2 * s²? Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on units.

Alternatively, perhaps B has units of J·s²/m²? Not sure, but I think the key is to compute the energy of the rotational transition.

So for J=0 → J=1, the energy change is E_rot = E(1) - E(0) = (B * 2) - 0 = 2B.

Wait, but B must be in Joules. Because E_rot is in Joules. So B = h²/(8 π² I ), which would be in Joules.

Wait, so let me recalculate B in Joules.

B = h²/(8 π² I )

h=6.626e-34 J s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈4.39e-67 J² s².

8 π² I =8 * (9.8696) * 1.2064e-46 kg m².

8 *9.8696≈78.957.

78.957 *1.2064e-46 ≈95.33e-46 =9.533e-45 kg m².

So B =4.39e-67 /9.533e-45 = approximately 4.39e-67 /9.533e-45 = 4.39/(9.533) * 1e-22 → approx 0.46 *1e-22 →4.6e-23 J.

So B ≈4.6e-23 J.

Then E_rot for J=1 → E= B *2 =9.2e-23 J.

Which matches my earlier calculation.

So the energy difference for the rotational transition is about 9.2e-23 J.

The photon's energy must match this. So E_photon =9.2e-23 J.

Then, photon momentum p = E_photon / c.

c=3e8 m/s.

p =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But this is way smaller than any of the options given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a pure rotational transition but a vibrational transition. Because the options are much larger than what I calculated for rotational.

If I compute the vibrational transition, E_photon =h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of this.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state (n=0) to the first vibrational excited state (n=1), regardless of rotational state. So the photon energy is ΔE_vib = h w.

So p = h w / c.

Compute that.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But none of the options is exactly this. However, option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly a quarter of this value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition that includes both a vibrational and a rotational change, but that's more complex and may not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial state. Maybe the molecule is in the first excited rotational state, and the next state is the next vibrational state. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: the problem says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule is in the state with the lowest rotational and vibrational energy, and the next state would be the next in the vibrational state, not the rotational. Because the vibrational energy is much higher. So the energy difference might be in the vibrational part.

But why is the photon's momentum not matching any of the options? My calculation for the vibrational transition gives p≈8.8e-28, but the option A is 1.9e-28. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate h w / c.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p =2.6504e-19 / (3e8) = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

But option A is 1.9e-28. So why is there a discrepancy? Let me check if I have the correct formula for the photon's momentum.

E_photon = pc → p= E/c.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition to the next vibrational state (n=1) and the next rotational state (J=1) together? That would be a combination, but I think that's more advanced and not what this question is about.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the Raman transition, which involves rotational changes, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the momentum in terms of the given variables without calculating B. Because perhaps I can find an expression for p in terms of h, w, etc.

Wait, the problem asks for the momentum of the photon. So E_photon =h w.

p= E/c = (h w)/(c).

Given that, let's compute it.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p=(6.626e-34 *4e14 ) /3e8 = (2.65e-19) /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But, again, this isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the model is a rigid rotor, and the rotational energy levels are different. Wait, but the question says non-rigid rotor model, but perhaps I'm confusing rigid and non-rigid.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is only about the vibrational transition, and the given options have a mistake, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the energy difference is not just h w, but includes some factor like 1/2 h w or other terms. Oh wait, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + ½) h w. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w. So that part was correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is referring to the transition to the next state in the rotational spectrum, which would require a photon with energy matching the rotational transition.

But earlier, I calculated the rotational transition momentum as p=3e-31 kg m/s, which is way below the options provided. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass calculation is wrong. Let me recompute μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2 )/(22) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Converting to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = approximately 2.999e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.81818 *1.6605 ≈3.016, so 3.016e-27 kg.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the rotational constant B is not h/(8 π² I), but (h/(2 π I)).

Wait, perhaps I was wrong to use B = h/(8 π² I). Let me double-check the formula.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J(J+1))/(2 I), where ħ = h/(2 π).

So E_rot = ( (h/(2 π))^2 J(J+1) )/( 2 I )

= h² J(J+1) / (8 π² I )

So, yes, B is h²/(8 π² I ), which is what I used earlier.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the transition from J=0 to J=1, but from J=1 to J=2, but that would have a higher energy and thus a larger p, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the model includes both rotational and vibrational contributions, and the next state is a combination of higher vibrational and higher rotational.

But I think the key is that the problem is asking for the photon momentum that allows the molecule to move to the next state with the lowest possible energy. That would be the transition with the smallest energy difference, which is the rotational transition. But according to the numbers, that's ~3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the Raman transition, which involves two photon interactions and changes in rotational state. But the question mentions a single photon being absorbed.

Another thought: perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, not the non-rigid. Does that change anything? Well, the rigid rotor ignores bond length changes due to vibration, so the bond length is fixed. But I think the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond length changes in vibration, but the formula for B would be similar.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I (the moment of inertia). Let me recheck.

I = μ R².

μ is correct, R is 2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So I=3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m²=1.2064e-46 kg m².

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of B.

B = h/(8 π² I ) =6.626e-34/(8*(pi)^2 *1.2064e-46 )

Wait, 8 pi² ≈78.9568.

So denominator:78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 = approximately 95.33e-46 =9.533e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.533e-45 ≈6.95e10 rad/s.

Hmm, that's correct.

So the energy difference for J=1 is 2B. But B is 6.95e10 rad/s. So E_rot= 2 *6.95e10 * hbar? Wait, no, B is in rad/s, which is 1/s.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy E_rot in terms of B.

E_rot = hbar * B * J (J+1 )

Wait, ħ = h/(2 pi) ≈1.05457e-34 J s.

So E_rot = ħ * B * J (J+1 )

For J=1, E_rot = 1.05457e-34 *6.95e10 *2.

So 1.05457e-34 *6.95e10 = approx 7.3e-24.

Multiply by 2: 1.46e-23 J.

So the energy difference is around 1.46e-23 J.

Photon momentum p=E/c=1.46e-23 /3e8=4.87e-32 kg m/s.

Still way too small compared to the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the rotational ground state to the first vibrational excited state, which would involve both a rotational and a vibrational change. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the energy difference between the rotational state and the vibrational state.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule is in a state of J=0 and n=0, and the next state is J=1 and n=0. The energy difference would be the rotational one, which is 9.2e-23 J, leading to a photon p=3e-31 kg m/s. But again, that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the absorption of a photon that causes a transition from J=0 to J=1, and the photon's momentum is p= hbar w_rot, where w_rot is the rotational frequency.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a pure rotational or pure vibrational transition, but a combination, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Let me look at the options again:

A) p = 1.9e-28 N s

B) p =2.3e-27

C) p=1.1e-27

D)p=1.4e-28

Wait, N s is kg m/s. So the options are in kg m/s.

If I compute the vibrational transition's p as 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which is option A (1.9e-28) is about half of that. So maybe I made a miscalculation in h or w?

Wait, h is 6.626e-34 J s. w is 4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Ah, wait, 8.8e-28 is 8.8e-28 kg m/s. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a quarter of this value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to a transition that involves half the energy. Because sometimes in vibrational transitions, the selection rule allows for Δn= ±1, but perhaps the energy difference is (n + ½) h w for each n.

Wait, the energy for each vibrational level is E_vib = (n + ½) h w.

So ΔE = E(n=1) - E(n=0) = (1.5 - 0.5) h w = h w.

So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the change in vibrational energy, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, no, because photon absorption leads to higher energy.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the model includes the zero-point energy, but the transition still requires the same energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the momentum using the given options, and see which one aligns.

Wait, option A: p=1.9e-28 kg m/s.

E=pc=1.9e-28 *3e8=5.7e-20 J.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

So 5.7e-20 is about 21% of h w. Doesn't seem to match.

Option D: p=1.4e-28 kg m/s.

E=1.4e-28 *3e8=4.2e-20 J.

Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me think again.

Wait, the energy difference for J=1 is 9.2e-23 J. Photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s, which is way below the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the next higher energy state regardless of type. So which transition requires the least energy: rotational or vibrational. As the rotational requires less energy, the photon should have p=3e-31 kg m/s. But this isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition in a different way. For example, using the moment of inertia including both atoms' masses.

Wait, wait, the reduced mass μ is correct, but perhaps the problem is using the total mass instead of the reduced mass. Let me see.

Wait, if I mistakenly used the total mass instead of the reduced mass, I would have made a mistake.

Total mass M = Mx + My =20 +2=22 amu =22 *1.66e-27 kg≈3.65e-26 kg.

If I used M instead of μ in I, then I would have I= M R²=3.65e-26 kg * (2e-10 m)^2= 3.65e-26 *4e-20=1.46e-45 kg m².

Then B =h/(8 pi² I)=6.626e-34 / (78.9568 *1.46e-45 )

78.9568*1.46e-45=1.154e-43.

So B=6.626e-34 /1.154e-43 ≈5.74e9 rad/s.

Then E_rot for J=1 would be 2 * (h²/(8 pi² I )) → but I think I'm getting off track.

This would give B=5.74e9 rad/s.

Then E_rot for J=1 is 2 * (h/(2pi)) * B → but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy with M instead of μ.

But this seems unlikely as the correct approach, but let's try.

E_rot = (h^2/(8 pi² I )) * J(J+1)

I=M R²=3.65e-26 kg *4e-20 m²=1.46e-45 kg m².

So for J=1,

E_rot = (6.626e-34)^2 * 2 / (8 pi² *1.46e-45 )

= (4.39e-67 *2) / ( 8 *9.8696 *1.46e-45 )

Denominator:8 *9.8696≈78.957, 78.957 *1.46e-45≈1.154e-43.

So numerator:8.78e-67.

E_rot =8.78e-67 /1.154e-43 ≈7.61e-24 J.

So the energy difference is 7.61e-24 J.

Photon momentum p=7.61e-24 /3e8=2.537e-32 kg m/s.

Still way too small compared to the options.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. According to the calculations, the rotational transition requires a photon with momentum around 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't an option, and the vibrational transition requires about 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition to the next state in terms of energy, which could involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the wrong formula for the rotational energy. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the photon's energy must match the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that would be even larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state with the next lowest energy, which might not be the vibrational but a rotational.

But given the options, the only possibility is that it's a vibrational transition, but why is the option not matching?

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = h w /c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 8.8e-28. The closest option is A:1.9e-28, but that's about a quarter of this value.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of w. Let me check the given w.

The problem states w=4e14 rad/s. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the dissociation energy, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon to go from J=0 to J=2, but that would have a higher energy.

E_rot for J=2 would be E= (h²/(8 pi² I )) * 6.

Which would be 6 *4.6e-23 =2.76e-22 J.

p=2.76e-22 /3e8=9.2e-31 kg m/s. Still not matching.

I'm not seeing any other approach here. It seems the correct calculation for the vibrational transition gives p=8.8e-28, but the options don't have this. However, perhaps the problem intended to consider rotational, which requires a smaller p, but the numbers don't align.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in another way. Let's think in terms of the rotational constant B in cm^-1.

Wait, the rotational constant in cm^-1 is B' = h/(8 pi² c I ), where c is the speed of light in cm/s.

But perhaps I can compute B' and then find the energy difference.

Wait, let's try.

c=3e8 m/s=3e10 cm/s.

I=1.2064e-46 kg m² =1.2064e-46 kg * (100 cm)^2 =1.2064e-46 *1e4 kg cm² =1.2064e-42 kg cm².

So B' = h/(8 pi² c I )

h=6.626e-34 J s =6.626e-34 J s * (1 erg/J) =6.626e-34 erg s.

Because 1 J=10^7 erg.

Wait, 1 J =10^7 erg, so 6.626e-34 J s =6.626e-34 *1e7 erg s =6.626e-27 erg s.

So B' =6.626e-27 erg s / (8 pi² *3e10 cm/s *1.2064e-42 kg cm² )

Wait, units are getting messy. Let me compute the denominator:

8 pi² c I =78.9568 *3e10 cm/s *1.2064e-42 kg cm².

Wait, wait.

I think perhaps this approach is getting too complicated, and I'm not getting anywhere.

Given that, I think the intended answer is the vibrational transition, leading to p=8.8e-28, but the closest option is A:1.9e-28, which is about 22% of that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from J=1 to J=0 when emitting a photon, but that's emission, not absorption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited state (n=1, J=0). So the energy difference is purely vibrational.

In that case, p=h w /c =6.626e-34 *4e14 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational frequency nu instead of w. Because nu = w/(2 pi).

So E_photon = h nu = h * w/(2 pi).

So p= h nu /c = h w/(2 pi c )

So let's compute:

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Divide by 2 pi: 2.65e-19 /6.283≈4.21e-19 J.

Then p=4.21e-19 /3e8=1.403e-28 kg m/s.

Which is close to option D:1.4e-28.

Ah! That could be it. Maybe I used the wrong formula, considering angular frequency instead of frequency.

Wait, the problem gives w as the angular frequency. So when calculating the photon's energy, I should use E=h w, but sometimes in some contexts, people use E=h nu, where nu is the frequency, and nu = w/(2 pi).

So perhaps the problem is treating w as the frequency, not the angular frequency.

Wait, the problem says, "angular frequency of vibration =4e14 rad/s." So w=4e14 rad/s.

But in the equation E=h nu, where nu =w/(2 pi).

So E=h nu = h * w/(2 pi).

So in that case, E=6.626e-34 *4e14/(2 pi) =6.626e-34 *4e14 /6.283 ≈ (2.65e-19 )/6.283 ≈4.21e-19 J.

p=4.21e-19 /3e8=1.403e-28 kg m/s.

Which matches option D:1.4e-28.

Ah, that's it! I think I see the mistake. I used E=h w, but if the problem defines w as angular frequency, then E=h w/(2 pi), leading to the correct option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy corresponds to a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1, as vibrational energy differences are much larger than rotational ones and dominate the energy spacing in this context.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Photon Energy for Vibrational Transition**:
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega
   \]
   The energy difference between \(n=0\) and \(n=1\) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = E(n=1) - E(n=0) = h \omega
   \]
   Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Photon Momentum**:
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:
   \[
   p = \frac{E}{c}
   \]
   where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\):
   \[
   p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

3. **Adjustment for Angular Frequency**:
   The problem specifies \(\omega\) as the angular frequency. In some contexts, the energy of a photon is expressed using the non-angular frequency \(\nu = \omega / (2\pi)\). Using this relationship, the energy becomes:
   \[
   E = h \nu = \frac{h \omega}{2\pi}
   \]
   Substituting \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\):
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14})}{2\pi} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{6.283} \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding momentum is:
   \[
   p = \frac{4.21 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.403 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The momentum of the photon required to transition the molecule is approximately \(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}\), which matches option **D**.

ANSWER: D
