Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, mainly the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Both planets are detected via transit and RV methods, so their distances can be determined.

Wait, the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff 6300 K. But for equilibrium temperature, the main thing is the star's luminosity. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So the star's luminosity is higher than the Sun's because its radius and Teff are higher than the Sun's. Let me calculate that.

Wait, the Sun's Teff is about 5778 K, right? So this star is hotter (6300 K) and bigger (1.2 R_sun). Let me compute L/L_sun. L/L_sun = (R/R_sun)² * (Teff/T_sun)^4. So (1.2)^2 * (6300/5778)^4. Let me compute that approximately. 1.2² is 1.44. 6300/5778 is about 1.09. 1.09^4 is about 1.41. So 1.44 * 1.41 is around 2.03. So the star is about twice as luminous as the Sun.

Now, for each planet, the equilibrium temperature formula is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance. Alternatively, another version is Te = (L/(16πσ a²))^1/4. Since L is known, and a is the distance, perhaps I can find a for each planet using the RV method data.

Wait, the problem gives me the Doppler shifts. For the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v sin i) = ( (G * M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1/(2π G)) ) * ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ... Wait, no, the RV formula for semi-amplitude is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (2π) ) ) ] * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) )? Wait, maybe I should think this through more clearly.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v * sin i) ) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (2π * a (1 - e²) ) ) )) )^{1/3} Wait, perhaps another approach. The formula I remember is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But this might complicate. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (M_star / M_sun) )^(-2/3) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(-1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since both planets are around the same star, and we can probably ignore M_p compared to M_star (since M_p is 7 and 5 Earth masses; M_star is 1.5 solar masses, which is 1500 Earth masses. So M_p << M_star, so M_p/M_star is negligible. So the (1 + M_p/M_star) term is approx 1. So we can simplify K as:

K ≈ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p Earth masses / M_jup) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since both planets are around same star, sqrt(1 - e²) is same for both (assuming same e, but since orbits are circular, e=0, so sqrt(1-e²)=1. So K is proportional to M_p * (M_star)^(-2/3).

Wait, but M_p is in Earth masses. Wait, 1 M_jup is about 318 Earth masses. So in the formula, M_p needs to be in Jupiter masses.

So for Planet1: M_p =7 Earth masses. So in Jupiters, that's 7 / 318 ≈ 0.02195 M_jup.

Planet2: 5 Earth masses → 5/318 ≈ 0.01572 M_jup.

The star mass is 1.5 M_sun.

So K1 = 27.4 * (0.02195) * (1.5)^(-2/3)

Similarly K2 = 27.4 * (0.01572) * (1.5)^(-2/3)

But the problem states that K1 (the shift from Planet1) is 0.03 Å, and K2 (shift from Planet2) is 0.04 Å.

Wait, but wait. RV shifts are measured in velocity (m/s) via the Doppler effect. The problem instead gives the shift in wavelength (angstroms), which relates to velocity via the Doppler formula.

The Doppler shift formula is:

Δλ / λ = v / c

But here, the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å. So Δλ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å.

v = c * (Δλ / λ)

c is speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s.

So for Planet1:

v1 = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300) = 3e5 * (0.03/6300) = 3e5 * (0.0000047619) ≈ 1.4286 m/s.

Similarly for Planet2, Δλ is 0.04 Å.

v2 = 3e5 km/s * (0.04 / 6300) = 3e5 * (0.04/6300) ≈ 3e5 * 0.000006349 ≈ 1.9048 m/s.

Wait, but wait: these velocities are the semi-amplitudes caused by each planet. But since the RV method detects the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit, the semi-amplitude K is the star's velocity. So K1 is 1.4286 m/s, K2 is 1.9048 m/s.

But earlier, the formula for K was in terms of the planet's mass and star's mass. So we can set up the equation for each planet.

So for Planet1:

K1 = 27.4 * (M_p1 / M_jup) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3 )

Similarly for Planet2:

K2 = 27.4 * (M_p2 / M_jup) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3 )

But M_p1 and M_p2 are in Earth masses. So, M_p1 =7, M_p2=5.

Wait, but wait, no: in the formula, K is calculated using M_p in Jupiter masses. So M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, which is 7 / 318 ≈ 0.02195 Jupiter masses.

So substituting:

K1 = 27.4 * (0.02195) * (1.5)^(-2/3 )

Similarly,

K2 = 27.4 * (0.01572) * (1.5)^(-2/3 )

Let me compute (1.5)^(-2/3). 1.5 is 3/2. So (3/2)^(2/3) is ( (3/2)^(1/3) )^2. The cube root of 3/2 is about 1.1447, so squared is about 1.310. So (1.5)^(2/3) ≈ 1.310. So (1.5)^(-2/3)= 1/1.310 ≈ 0.7633.

So compute K1:

27.4 * 0.02195 ≈ 0.600. Then times 0.7633: 0.600 * 0.7633 ≈ 0.458 m/s.

But wait, the K1 is given as 1.4286 m/s, according to the velocity calculation. Hmm, so something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I got the wrong formula for K. Let me think again. I think I might have confused the formula. The correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (1) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (2π)^(1/3) * c ) ) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) )

But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula from the radial velocity method:

K = [ (v ) ] = (28.4 m/s) * ( (M_p sin i) / M_jup ) * ( (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) * ( (1 + M_p / M_star )^(-1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

Since e=0 (circular orbit), and M_p << M_star, so (1 + M_p/M_star) ≈ 1. So simplify:

K ≈ 28.4 * (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) * (M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3 )

But wait, in the problem, K1 is 1.4286 m/s (from the shift), and K2 is 1.9048 m/s.

So for Planet1:

1.4286 = 28.4 * (7 / 318) ) * (1.5)^(-2/3 )

Wait, because M_p is 7 Earth masses, which is 7 / 318 ≈ 0.02195 M_jup.

So compute 28.4 * 0.02195 = 0.618. Then multiply by (1.5)^(-2/3)=0.7633: 0.618 * 0.7633 ≈ 0.472 m/s. But the observed K1 is 1.4286 m/s, which is three times higher. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula says K is in m/s. The star's mass is in solar masses, planet's mass in Jupiter masses.

So let me compute K1 using the formula:

K1 = 28.4 * (7 Earth masses / (318 Earth masses)) ) * (1.5)^(-2/3 )

Which is 28.4 * (7/318) * (1.5)^(-2/3 )

Compute 7/318 ≈ 0.02195.

Compute (1.5)^(-2/3) ≈ 0.7633.

So 28.4 * 0.02195 = 0.618.

0.618 * 0.7633 ≈ 0.472 m/s.

But according to the problem, K1 is 1.4286 m/s. So 0.472 is much less. So that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me check. Another source says K is given by:

K = ( (v ) ) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / ( (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) * (P * 86400 ) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / c ) ) )^(1/3 )

Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach via Kepler's third law. The RV method gives the mass function, which relates to the planet's mass and the inclination. But since we're assuming the orbits are edge-on (as transit implies i≈90°, so sin i ≈1), we can perhaps get the actual mass.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

But without knowing the orbital periods, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of the periods, and from that the ratio of the semi-major axes.

Wait, but I don't have the periods. Hmm. Alternatively, since the planet's cause a Doppler shift, which gives us K, and with the star's mass, perhaps we can find the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, in the problem statement, both planets are causing a shift in the same forbidden line. So perhaps the line is from the star's atmosphere, and the shift is due to the reflex motion of the star. So the RV semi-amplitude K (velocity) is what's causing the shift.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should find the ratio of the distances a1 and a2 from the star, and then compute the equilibrium temperatures based on that.

The equilibrium temperature formula is Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) )

So Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / ( R_star/(2a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So if I can find a1/a2, then I can get the temperature ratio.

But to find a1 and a2, I can use Kepler's third law, which says:

P² = (4π²/G M_star) a³

But without the periods, I need another approach. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K relates to the planet's mass and orbital distance.

Wait, the formula for K in terms of a and M_p is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e² )^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (2π a )^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to express a in terms of K.

Alternatively, another formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (27.4 m/s ) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_jup ) ) * ( M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3 ) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(-1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1-e²) )

Again, assuming e=0 and M_p<<M_star, so (1 + M_p/M_star) ≈1, and sqrt(1-e²)=1.

So K ≈ 27.4 * (M_p/M_jup) * (M_star/M_sun)^(-2/3 )

So for each planet:

K1 = 27.4 * (M_p1/M_jup) * (1.5)^(-2/3 )

Similarly,

K2 = 27.4 * (M_p2/M_jup) * (1.5)^(-2/3 )

But we have K1 and K2 from the problem: K1 corresponds to 0.03 Å shift, which is v1 = 1.4286 m/s; K2 is 0.04 Å, which is v2 = 1.9048 m/s.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the shift in forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å is up to 0.03 Å for Planet1, and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So K1 is 1.4286 m/s, K2 is 1.9048 m/s.

So plug into the formula:

For Planet1,

1.4286 = 27.4 * (7 / 318) * (1.5)^(-2/3 )

Compute (7/318) ≈ 0.02195.

Compute (1.5)^(-2/3) ≈ 0.7633.

So 27.4 * 0.02195 = 0.600.

0.600 * 0.7633 ≈ 0.458 m/s.

But the given K1 is 1.4286 m/s. So 0.458 is way less. Hmm, so this approach doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I've used the wrong formula. Alternatively, maybe the K formula I have is for velocity semi-amplitude in m/s, but the problem gives the shift in wavelength, which is a different quantity.

Wait, let's think again. The Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is related to velocity by Δλ/λ = v/c.

So for each planet, their induced velocity is v1 and v2.

But the RV method measures the velocity of the star. So perhaps the formula I have earlier relates K to the velocity.

So if I can find the mass function, but since the orbit is circular and edge-on (as transit implies), the mass function equals the planet's mass.

Wait, the mass function f(m) = (M_p^3 sin^3 i)/( (M_star + M_p)^2 )

But for edge-on orbits (i=90°, sin i=1), and M_p << M_star, f(m) ≈ M_p^3 / M_star^2.

But the RV semi-amplitude K is related to f(m) via:

K = (v) = (2.15e5 m/s ) * ( (f(m) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) )

But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of a1 and a2 using the RV data.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1) ) / ( (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) * (2π)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1) / (a (1 - e^2 ) )^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Using the formula for K in terms of a, M_p, and M_star.

Wait, K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (2π a )^(1/3) ) ) ]

But since e=0, this becomes:

K = [ (G M_p ) / (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * [1/( (2π a )^(1/3) ) ]

So,

K = [ (G M_p ) / (M_star * 2π a ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Cube both sides:

K³ = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star * 2 π a )

So,

a = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star * 2 π K³ )

But G is a constant, but perhaps it's easier to express a in terms of K for each planet.

Since both planets are around the same star, let's compute a1 and a2.

But perhaps it's easier to take the ratio a1/a2.

Let me write:

a1 = (G M_p1 ) / ( M_star * 2 π K1³ )

a2 = (G M_p2 ) / ( M_star * 2 π K2³ )

So the ratio a1/a2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (K2³ / K1³ )

Because G, M_star, 2 π are same in both.

So,

a1/a2 = (7/5) * ( (1.9048)³ / (1.4286)³ )

Compute the cube terms:

1.9048³ ≈ (approx, 1.9048 * 1.9048 = approx 3.628, then *1.9048 ≈ 6.910 )

1.4286³ is approx (1.4286)^2 ≈ 2.04, then *1.4286 ≈ 2.916.

So,

a1/a2 ≈ (7/5) * (6.910 / 2.916 ) ≈ (1.4) * (2.371) ≈ 3.32.

So a1 is about 3.32 times a2.

Wait, that's a1/a2 ≈ 3.32. So a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, but wait, if a1 is larger than a2, then Planet1 is farther, so its equilibrium temperature would be lower (since Te is inversely proportional to sqrt(a)).

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

So Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

So if a1 is 3.32 times a2, then a2/a1 is 1/3.32 ≈ 0.301.

So sqrt(0.301) ≈ 0.549.

So the ratio Te1/Te2 ≈ 0.549, which is about 0.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53. Close.

But wait, let me compute the ratio more accurately.

Compute K1 and K2 accurately.

K1 from the wavelength shift: Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, λ =6300 Å.

v1 = c * (Δλ / λ) = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 /6300) = 3e5 * (0.0000047619) = 1.42857 m/s.

Similarly, K2: Δλ2=0.04 Å.

v2=3e5 * (0.04/6300) = 3e5 * 0.000006349 ≈ 1.90476 m/s.

So K1=1.42857 m/s, K2=1.90476 m/s.

Now, ratio a1/a2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (K2/K1)^3.

M_p1=7, M_p2=5 → 7/5=1.4.

K2/K1 = 1.90476 /1.42857 ≈ 1.3333 → exactly 4/3.

So (K2/K1)^3 = (4/3)^3 = 64/27 ≈ 2.37037.

So a1/a2 = 1.4 * (64/27) = 1.4 * 2.37037 ≈ 3.3185.

So a1 = 3.3185 a2.

Thus, a2/a1 = 1/3.3185≈ 0.3013.

So sqrt(a2/a1)=sqrt(0.3013)= approx 0.549.

So Te1/Te2 =0.549, so Te1=0.549 Te2.

So the ratio is Te1/Te2≈0.549, which is approximately 0.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is the closest.

So the answer is C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_e = T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}}
\]

where \(T_{\text{star}}\) is the effective temperature of the star, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between the two planets is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the key is to find the ratio of the orbital distances \(a_1/a_2\). To do this, we use the radial velocity (RV) data provided. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_p\), the star's mass \(M_{\text{star}}\), and the orbital distance \(a\) by:

\[
K = \frac{v} = \frac{(G M_p)}{(M_{\text{star}} + M_p)^{1/3}} \cdot \frac{1}{(1 - e^2)^{1/2}} \cdot \frac{1}{(2 \pi a)^{1/3}}
\]

For circular orbits (\(e = 0\)) and assuming \(M_p \ll M_{\text{star}}\), this simplifies to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{1/3}}
\]

Rearranging, the orbital distance \(a\) can be expressed as:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p}{K^3}
\]

The ratio of the orbital distances is then:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \frac{K_2^3}{K_1^3}
\]

From the problem, the masses of the planets are \(M_{p1} = 7 M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 M_{\text{Earth}}\), and the RV semi-amplitudes are \(K_1 = 1.4286 \, \text{m/s}\) (from the 0.03 Å shift) and \(K_2 = 1.9048 \, \text{m/s}\) (from the 0.04 Å shift). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{(1.9048)^3}{(1.4286)^3}
\]

First, calculate the cube terms:

\[
(1.9048)^3 \approx 6.910, \quad (1.4286)^3 \approx 2.916
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{6.910}{2.916} \approx 1.4 \cdot 2.371 \approx 3.32
\]

Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.32}} \approx \sqrt{0.301} \approx 0.549
\]

This corresponds to approximately 0.55. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.53**.

**Answer: C**
