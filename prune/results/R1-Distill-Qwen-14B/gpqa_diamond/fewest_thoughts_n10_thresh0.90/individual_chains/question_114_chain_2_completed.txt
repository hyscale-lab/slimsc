Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one, sodium cyanide (NaCN), and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to make 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing different A and B reagents.

Hmm, I remember that reactions involving ketones and nitriles might be nucleophilic substitutions. Let me try to recall the mechanisms.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. I think that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, no, wait. Wait, ketones usually don't undergo nucleophilic substitution because they don't have good leaving groups. Oh wait, but if the ketone is adjacent to a leaving group... Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which doesn't have a leaving group. So maybe it's an addition reaction? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe it's about the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yes! I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it forms a cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the cyanide acting as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen becomes an -OH group. But wait, how does the work up happen?

So the reaction of a ketone with CN- would form a cyanohydrin after acid work-up. Because to make the cyanide nucleophilic, the solution must be basic, but then acid work-up is done to protonate and give the alcohol. Oh wait, but in this first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, but wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but wait, but how?

Wait, let me think again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which provides CN- ions, it forms a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. The mechanism is that CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate, with the oxygen having a negative charge, which is then protonated. But wait, in the presence of an acid or a base? Oh wait, I think that the reaction between ketones and CN- usually uses a weak base, like H2O with a little base, but sometimes it's done under acidic conditions. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formation of cyanohydrin typically involves a weak base to deprotonate the oxygen. Alternatively, sometimes the solution is made slightly basic to allow the attack.

Wait, but looking back at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butanenitrile would mean four carbons and the nitrile. Hmm, but butan-2-one is three carbons with the ketone in the middle. So the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me write down the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, the CN- will attack the carbonyl carbon, adding to it. The oxygen will then have a negative charge, which will pick up a proton. But wait, in the presence of what? If the solution is acidic, then the work-up would protonate it with H+.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN, but wait, but that's five carbons. Wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons, so the nitrile is on C1, then the rest.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When the CN- adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that would have the structure where the nitrile is attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl and the two methyl groups. So the molecule would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)COCH2CH3. No, wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO—so that's (CH3)2-CO, right? Then the product after adding CN would be (CH3)2-C(OH)CN. But that's a three-carbon chain, not four. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, perhaps. But the question says butanenitrile, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction. Maybe the reaction is a substitution, but butan-2-one doesn't have a good leaving group. So maybe the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin, which upon treatment with an acid gives the alcohol, but in this case, the product is already the cyanohydrin, so perhaps the work-up is with acid.

Wait, so reagent A is the acid work-up. So, for the first step, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid to form the cyanohydrin. So, in the reaction, the NaCN is the nucleophile, and the work-up with acid would protonate the oxygen, giving the hydroxyl group.

So, what's reagent A? It's probably an acid. Looking at the options, options A, B, C, D's A reagents are either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is an acid (since HSO3^- is a weak acid). So, in option C, A is NaHSO3, a source of H+ perhaps?

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is formed when butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in an acidic condition. So, the work-up would involve acid. So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is H+ in water), or perhaps another acid like H2SO4, but in the options, the choices are either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

So, if reagent A is H3O+ (option A and B), or NaHSO3 (option C and D), which is a source of H+ as well, because NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^-; HSO3^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to become SO3^2- or as a base, but in acidic conditions, it would donate H+).

So, in the first reaction, the reagent A is an acid. So options A, B, C, D: A is either H3O+ (A and B) or NaHSO3 (C and D).

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the structure has a nitrile group, a hydroxyl group on the same carbon, and a benzylphenyl group attached.

The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.

Wait, that makes sense. The nitrile is converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For the conversion to a carboxylic acid, you typically have strong acidic conditions or strong basic conditions followed by acid work-up.

Wait, the general reaction is: nitrile + H2O (under acidic or basic conditions) → amide, which then gets hydrolyzed further to the carboxylic acid. Wait, but the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but what reagents are used for that? I think that hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done using a strong acid, like HCl, under reflux. Alternatively, using a strong base like aqueous NaOH, followed by acid work-up.

So, in the second reaction, the reagent B is used along with H2O. So, what's reagent B? If it's HCl, that would be an acidic hydrolysis. If it's something else, like acetic acid (CH3COOH), that would be a mild acid.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So, the hydrolysis must be complete. Let me think about the conditions.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in different ways. For example, in the presence of H2O and HCl (acidic conditions), the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, with aqueous NaOH (strong base) and then acid work-up would convert it to the carboxylic acid.

But in this case, the reagent B is used along with H2O. So, if B is HCl (like option A: B=HCl, option C: B=HCl), then the reaction is under acidic conditions.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH (option B and D), then it's a weak acid. But would that be sufficient for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

Wait, I think that nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids typically requires more vigorous conditions. For example, using HCl with heat, or using a strong base followed by acid. So, perhaps reaction B is using HCl as the reagent.

So, reagent B is HCl, which would be option A or C.

Now, let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, for the first reaction, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. For the second reaction, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

From earlier analysis, the first reaction requires an acid work-up, so A is H3O+ or NaHSO3. The second reaction requires HCl as the reagent (acid hydrolysis) to convert the nitrile to carboxylic acid.

So, looking at options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → possible.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → possible.

Which one is correct?

Wait, what's the role of reagent A in the first reaction? It's the work-up after the nucelophilic addition. So, when NaCN is added to the ketone, perhaps in a solution that's made slightly basic to deprotonate the oxygen. Then, after the reaction, you acidify to get the protonated hydroxyl.

Wait, no, wait. The formation of the cyanohydrin typically uses a base to deprotonate the oxygen after the attack, but sometimes it's done under neutral or acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done in a slightly basic solution and then acidified.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is done in a basic solution. Let me think. The reaction between ketone and NaCN: NaCN is a source of CN- in solution. I think that the reaction is typically carried out in a basic environment because the oxygen of the ketone is deprotonated, making it a better leaving group? No, wait, the ketone's oxygen is not a good leaving group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, here's another approach. The cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is electrophilic. Then, the oxygen becomes an alkoxide, which needs to be protonated to form the hydroxyl group. So, the reaction would require an acidic work-up. So, after the initial reaction (which may be in a basic or neutral solution), you add an acid to protonate the oxygen.

So, if the first step is done under basic conditions (maybe using NaCN in a solution where the pH is basic), then the work-up would be with an acid (H+).

Looking at the options, if the work-up is with H3O+ (proton source), that would be reagent A.

Alternatively, if the reaction is done in neutral conditions and then acid is added, same thing.

So, in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (acid) or NaHSO3 (which provides H+ as well).

But wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is a strong acid, like HCl, H2SO4). So, if the work-up requires a strong acid, then H3O+ would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps in the reaction, the solution is acidified with H3O+.

So, if A is H3O+, that's option A or B.

In the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (option A or C) or CH3COOH (option B or D). Since the second reaction needs to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which requires strong acidic conditions, HCl would be better than a weak acid like acetic acid.

So, putting it all together:

First reaction: A is H3O+ (acid for protonating the alkoxide).

Second reaction: B is HCl (acid for hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid).

Looking at the options, that's option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the options.

Option A: A=H3O+ (so acid for first reaction), B=HCl (acid for second reaction).

Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but another thought: in the first reaction, if NaCN is present, and the solution is acidic, would that affect the reaction? Because in acidic conditions, CN- can be protonated to form HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile. So, maybe the reaction should be done under basic conditions to keep CN- available.

Ah, that's a good point. If the solution is too acidic, the CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile and won't attack the carbonyl as effectively.

So, maybe the reaction is carried out in a basic solution, and then acid is added as the work-up.

Wait, so the initial reaction (adding NaCN) is done in a basic solution, perhaps using NaOH as a base. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the solution is neutral, and then the work-up is done with acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses HCN, which is a weaker acid than H2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is done in a solution that's made slightly basic to keep CN- available. Then, after the reaction, it's acidified to protonate the oxygen.

But in the options, the reagents are either H3O+ or NaHSO3, which are both acids. So, perhaps the first reaction is done in a neutral or slightly acidic solution, but that might not be ideal for the nucleophilic attack.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN. The product is a cyanohydrin. The reaction typically uses a weak base to deprotonate the oxygen after the attack. But sometimes, the reaction can be done under acidic conditions, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the cyanohydrin formation is often done in a solution that's slightly basic to deprotonate the oxygen after the attack. So, perhaps the reaction is done in a basic solution. But none of the options for A are bases. So, perhaps the work-up is done with an acid, implying that the initial reaction was in a basic solution.

Wait, but in the options, A is the reagent used along with NaCN. So, perhaps reagent A is the base used during the reaction, and then maybe the work-up is done separately.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for another angle.

Looking at the product of the first reaction: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. If I think about the structure, it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, no, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so maybe the structure is CH2(CN)CH(OH)(CH3)CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the structure right, but perhaps that's not crucial right now.

The key point is that the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which requires an acid work-up. So, the reagent A would be an acid.

So, the first reaction uses an acid, and the second uses HCl.

So, the correct option is A or C. Option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

Wait, but what's NaHSO3 used for? Sodium bisulfate is a source of H+ (HSO3^- is a weak acid). So, in the first reaction, adding NaHSO3 would provide H+ to protonate the alkoxide. So, that could be a possible scenario.

But earlier I thought that the reaction might need a base, but perhaps not. Let me think again. The initial reaction between the ketone and NaCN would proceed in a solution where CN- is available. If the solution is too acidic, CN- is protonated to HCN, a weaker nucleophile. So, to maximize the nucleophilicity of CN-, the solution should be as basic as possible.

Wait, but if the reaction is done in a basic solution, then the work-up would require acid. But in the options, the reagents are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So, perhaps for the first reaction, the solution is initially made basic (using something like NaOH), then the reaction occurs, and finally, it's acidified with H3O+ or NaHSO3.

But in the given options, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3, suggesting that A is the work-up reagent. So, the reaction between butan-2-one and NaCN occurs in basic conditions (so that CN- remains available), and then acid is added (H3O+ or NaHSO3) to protonate the alkoxide group.

But which acid is better for that? H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 is a weaker acid. Which one is more suitable for work-up after the reaction?

Well, adding a strong acid would protonate the alkoxide more effectively. So, H3O+ (option A) would be better. But I'm not entirely certain.

Putting it all together: for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (acid work-up), and for the second reaction, B is HCl (acid hydrolysis of nitrile to acid). So, that would be option A.

Wait, but in the first reaction, if the solution is acidified with H3O+, would that protonate the CN-? Because in acidic conditions, CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile. So, the reaction might not proceed as effectively.

Wait, but the first reaction is adding NaCN to the ketone. So, perhaps the reaction is done under basic conditions, but the work-up is with acid. So, the initial reaction is done in a basic solution, and then the work-up is acid.

But the options don't specify the initial conditions, only the reagent added. So, perhaps the reaction is done with NaCN in a solution that's made basic, and then acid is added as reagent A to protonate the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is done in neutral solution, and then acid is added as reagent A.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl. So, in the first reaction, the work-up is with NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid than H3O+. Would that be better for avoiding the protonation of CN-?

Wait, if the solution is made weakly acidic with NaHSO3, then the CN- would be less protonated than in a strongly acidic solution. So, more CN- available for the reaction.

So, perhaps for the first reaction, using a weaker acid like NaHSO3 is better because it doesn't protonate CN- as much, allowing the reaction to proceed.

Then, for the second reaction, HCl is needed for the strong acid hydrolysis.

So, putting it together, option C would be A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

But wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: when NaCN is added to a ketone, what conditions are typically used? I think that the reaction is often done in a basic solution because the hydroxide ion can deprotonate the alpha hydrogens, making the ketone more reactive. Or wait, no, the alpha hydrogens are not directly involved in the reaction.

Wait, another thing: the formation of the cyanohydrin can be done under basic conditions, where the solution is made slightly basic to deprotonate the oxygen after the attack. So, for the reaction, CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, making an alkoxide intermediate, which is then protonated during work-up.

So, the initial reaction is done under basic conditions, and then the work-up is acidic.

In the options, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So, if the work-up is acid, then A is an acid.

But in the initial reaction, the solution is perhaps made basic, but the options don't provide a base as reagent A. So, perhaps the reagents A and B are the work-up reagents, not the reaction conditions.

Wait, the question says: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

So, in this case, reagent A is used along with NaCN in the reaction. So, perhaps the reaction is done in the presence of A.

So, if A is H3O+ (option A), then the reaction is carried out under acidic conditions. But as I thought before, that might not be ideal because CN- would be protonated.

Alternatively, if A is NaHSO3 (option C), which is a weaker acid, perhaps it's better because it doesn't protonate CN- as much.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is done in neutral conditions, and A is H3O+ for the work-up. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: in the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile must have undergone hydrolysis. The reagent B is used along with H2O. So, if B is HCl, then it's acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

In that case, the correct option would have B=HCl, which is options A and C.

So, looking back, if the first reaction uses H3O+ (option A) and the second uses HCl (option A), that seems plausible.

But the first reaction would have the CN- in an acidic solution, which might not be ideal. So maybe option C is better, with NaHSO3.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is done under neutral conditions, and the acid is added as the work-up. So, for the first reaction, the reagent A is the acid that protonates the product.

So, in the first reaction, the product is the cyanohydrin, which is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Without the acid work-up, it would be the alkoxide. So, the acid is needed to protonate the oxygen.

In that case, reagent A could be either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Which one is more appropriate?

Well, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (HSO3^- is a weak acid). So, when added, it would donate H+ to the alkoxide, converting it to the alcohol.

H3O+ is a stronger acid, but perhaps it's more effective in protonating the alkoxide.

But, in the presence of H3O+, would the CN- be protonated? Maybe. So, if H3O+ is in excess, CN- could form HCN, reducing the nucleophilicity.

So, perhaps using a weaker acid like NaHSO3 would be better to minimize the protonation of CN-.

So, perhaps reagent A is NaHSO3, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: when NaHSO3 is used, it might also act as a sulfonation agent, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ as the work-up, which is a strong acid, but the initial reaction is done in a basic solution.

But the options don't include a base as reagent A. So, perhaps the reaction is done in neutral conditions with A being the acid.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Putting it all together, the correct option is C: A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

Wait, wait a second. Let me check the second reaction again. If the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, then the nitrile is converted to a COOH group. So, the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

The typical conditions for this are acidic or basic. Under acidic conditions, using HCl and water, heat. Under basic conditions, using NaOH and then acid work-up.

So, in the second reaction, if B is HCl, then it's an acidic hydrolysis. If B is CH3COOH, it's a weak acid, which might not be strong enough for the reaction to proceed efficiently.

So, the second reaction requires B=HCl. Therefore, among the options, either A or C.

Now, back to the first reaction. If A is NaHSO3, which provides H+ (since HSO3^- can donate a proton), it would protonate the alkoxide. But wait, in the first reaction, the product is the cyanohydrin. So, perhaps the first reaction is done under neutral or basic conditions, and then acid is added as work-up.

But the options don't have a base as reagent A. So, perhaps reagent A is the acid used in the work-up.

If the first reaction is done under basic conditions, but the options don't have a base, perhaps the work-up is with acid.

So, for the first reaction, reagent A is NaHSO3 (mild acid) to protonate without over-protonating CN-.

Then, in the second reaction, B is HCl for the strong acid hydrolysis.

So, the correct option would be option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another way to approach this is to look for the correct reagent combinations.

In the first reaction, the formation of a cyanohydrin is typically done under basic conditions with HCN (which is not the case here, as it's using NaCN). But NaCN in a basic solution would work better. However, the options don't include a base, so perhaps the work-up is with a mild acid like NaHSO3.

Alternatively, the first reaction could be done in situ with NaCN and NaHSO3, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: let's look at the options. Which options have B=HCl? Options A and C.

If the second reaction requires HCl, then the correct answer is either A or C.

Now, for the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then it's a strong acid. But in the presence of H3O+, CN- would be protonated to HCN, which is a weaker nucleophile, making the reaction less effective.

So, perhaps using NaHSO3 (a weaker acid) as reagent A is better because it doesn't protonate the CN- as much, allowing the reaction to proceed. So, reagent A is NaHSO3, and reagent B is HCl.

So, the correct option is C.


The question involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where CN⁻ attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin.  
   - The reaction typically requires an acid work-up to protonate the alkoxide intermediate, converting it into the hydroxyl group.  
   - Among the options, reagent A must be an acid. H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) or NaHSO₃ (a weaker acid) are possible candidates.  
   - However, using H₃O⁺ could protonate CN⁻ to form HCN, reducing its nucleophilicity. In contrast, NaHSO₃, being a weaker acid, minimizes this issue while still facilitating the work-up.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.  
   - Strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl, are typically required for this reaction to proceed efficiently.  
   - A weak acid like CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is insufficient for this transformation.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is a strong acid, which could protonate CN⁻ to form HCN, reducing its nucleophilicity in Reaction 1. This makes it less ideal.  
  - HCl is suitable for Reaction 2.  

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - H₃O⁺ has the same issue as in Option A for Reaction 1.  
  - CH₃COOH is a weak acid and insufficient for the hydrolysis in Reaction 2.  

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid, which minimizes the protonation of CN⁻ in Reaction 1, making it more suitable for forming the cyanohydrin.  
  - HCl is appropriate for Reaction 2.  

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is suitable for Reaction 1.  
  - CH₃COOH is insufficient for Reaction 2.  

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents are A = NaHSO₃ (for Reaction 1) and B = HCl (for Reaction 2), as they address the requirements of both reactions effectively.  

**Answer: C**
