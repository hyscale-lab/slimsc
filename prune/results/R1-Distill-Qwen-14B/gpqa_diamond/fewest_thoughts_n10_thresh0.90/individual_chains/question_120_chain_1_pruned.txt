Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / plx. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? I think it probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space, like stars are spread out evenly throughout the volume. So the number of stars in a given volume doesn't depend on where you are in that volume.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So we're looking at how the count varies as a function of parallax. Let's break this down.

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, meaning that as d increases, plx decreases. So the parallax range is inversely related to distance.

If I imagine a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell would depend on its volume. Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume.

The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in this shell, N, would be n * 4πr² dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). But wait, since we're dealing with a uniform distribution, n is constant.

But how does this relate to parallax? Let's express everything in terms of parallax. Since r = 1/plx, we can write r as d = 1/plx, but wait, no. Wait, plx is in arcseconds, but the formula is distance (d in parsecs) is 1/plx (in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx. So r = d = 1/plx.

So the volume element dr is the change in distance. Let me express everything in terms of plx. Let's say we have a small change in plx, dplx. Then, dr = derivative of r with respect to plx times dplx. Since r = 1/plx, dr/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So dr = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. But since we're considering a small range, maybe the negative just indicates direction, but the magnitude would be positive. So the change in r is approximately (1/(plx^2)) dplx.

Now, the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx, that's 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the shell's volume is 4πr² dr, and r is 1/plx, so 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr = (1/(plx^2)) dplx, so substituting that in: 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Because dr is the change in distance. So if plx increases by dplx, then the distance decreases because plx is inversely proportional to distance. But the shell at distance r would have a certain thickness dr. The volume is 4π r² dr. So, since r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. The negative just tells us the direction, but the magnitude is what matters. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. That's 4π / plx^4 * dplx.

Wait, but that would make the
