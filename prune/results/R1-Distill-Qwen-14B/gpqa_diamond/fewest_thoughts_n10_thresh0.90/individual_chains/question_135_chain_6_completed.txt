Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given its mass and the interaction Lagrangian provided.

Alright, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might be getting confused here. Let me parse that. Oh, right, I think the Lagrangian is describing the interaction between the boson field X and some fermions. The term involves ψ_f bar ψ_f, so that's probably Yukawa coupling kind of stuff.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to find out what particles it can decay into. The options are various fermion-antifermion pairs.

In particle physics, for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson needs to be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair. Because energy and mass are related via E=mc², right? So the decay X → f f-bar is allowed only if the mass of X is greater than or equal to 2m_f.

But wait, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me list them:

- Electron (e): negligible, like 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.77 GeV
- Up quark (u): like 0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): around 0.004 GeV
- Strange (s): about 0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

So the boson X is 6 GeV. Let's calculate 2m_f for each possible pair.

For each fermion f, 2m_f needs to be ≤ 6 GeV.

Looking at the fermions:

- Top quark: way too heavy, 2m_t is way over 6 GeV, so can't decay into t t-bar.
- Bottom quark: 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than 6, so no decay into b b-bar.
Wait wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Mass of b is about 4.5 GeV. So 2 * 4.5 is 9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less, so X cannot decay into b b-bar. So any option that includes b b-bar would be incorrect.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A includes b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. But since X is 6 GeV, and 2m_tau is about 3.54 GeV (since tau is ~1.77 GeV). So 6 GeV is more than that, so tau pair is allowed.

Wait, let me correct: X is 6 GeV. So for each possible fermion pair:

- e+ e-: 2m_e is negligible, so allowed.
- mu+ mu-: 2m_mu is about 0.2 GeV, allowed.
- tau+ tau-: 2m_tau is ~3.54 GeV, allowed.
- u u-bar: 2m_u ~0.006 GeV, allowed.
- d d-bar: 2m_d ~0.008 GeV, allowed.
- s s-bar: 2m_s ~0.19 GeV, allowed.
- c c-bar: 2m_c ~3 GeV, allowed.
- b b-bar: 2m_b ~9 GeV, not allowed.
- t t-bar: way too heavy.

So which fermions can X decay into? All except b and t.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b and tau. But X can't decay into b. So A is wrong.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So c is allowed, because 2*1.5=3 <=6. So yes. So B includes c c-bar, which is allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy, so option C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is not allowed. So D is wrong.

Wait, but looking back, the Lagrangian given in the question may affect which fermions are coupled. The interaction term is given as -λ f f-bar (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, I'm not too sure about the notation. Wait, the term is written as -λ f \bar{\psi_f} (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps ψ_f is the fermion field for flavor f. So the interaction is between X and fermions of flavor f. So perhaps this implies that X can interact with all fermions except maybe the top quark? Because the top is too heavy, but in the Lagrangian, the interaction is written for any fermion ψ_f.

Wait, but the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it can couple to, provided the mass condition is satisfied.

So the possible decay products are any fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV, and the boson couples to them.

So from the fermion masses, as before, any f where 2m_f ≤6.

Which are:

c: 2*1.5=3 ≤6 → allowed.

s: 2*0.1=0.2 ≤6 → allowed.

u: 2*0.003=0.006 ≤6 → allowed.

d: 2*0.004=0.008 ≤6 → allowed.

tau: 2*1.77=3.54 ≤6 → allowed.

mu: 2*0.1=0.2 ≤6 → allowed.

e: negligible → allowed.

b: 2*4.5=9 >6 → not allowed.

t: way too heavy → not allowed.

So the allowed decays are into pairs of c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options:

Option B is X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but what about the boson's coupling? The problem gives the Lagrangian as involving ψ_f, so perhaps the X can only decay into fermions that are in the same interaction. Wait, the Lagrangian is given as (for each fermion flavor f), so the X can interact with any fermion as long as the mass allows.

Therefore, the allowed decays are all the pairs except those whose 2m_f exceeds 6 GeV. So the allowed are for all f where 2m_f ≤6 GeV. Which as above includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of the boson must satisfy \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion. Additionally, the interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can couple to any fermion flavor \( f \), provided the mass condition is met.

The masses of the fermions are as follows:
- \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_\tau \approx 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_u \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_d \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

Using the mass condition \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), the allowed decays are:
- \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.54 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2m_u \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2m_d \approx 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2m_c \approx 3.0 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( b \bar{b} \): \( 2m_b \approx 9.0 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed.
- \( t \bar{t} \): \( 2m_t \approx 346.0 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed.

From the options provided:
- **Option A** includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed, so it is incorrect.
- **Option B** includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed, so it is correct.
- **Option C** includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed, so it is incorrect.
- **Option D** includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed, so it is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
