Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So, the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, what's the structure of the energy levels here? Oh right, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational and vibrational states.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy transitions. The molecule absorbs a photon, so the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the two states. Since the molecule is in the fundamental (lowest) state, the next state is probably the first excited state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, but molecules can have both rotational and vibrational energy levels. 

Wait, the fundamental state is when both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their lowest, right? So the ground state is v=0 and J=0. The next state would be either an increment in J or v. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the energy increases the least—probably the next rotational state instead of the next vibrational state, because vibrational energy changes are much larger than rotational. Oh, wait, but in some models, the next state could involve a combination—like maybe it's the next higher vibrational state. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state after the fundamental would be the first state that's higher in energy. Since vibrational energy levels are quantized with much larger spacing (like proportional to square of quantum numbers?), maybe the first transition is a vibrational one. Or perhaps it's a rotational transition since the energy steps might be smaller.

Wait, let me think. The fundamental state is the ground state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Which one has lower energy? I remember that the vibrational energy levels are higher than rotational ones, because the rotational energy is quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and the vibrational energy is E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, which is much higher for v=1. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next rotational state, J=1, v=0.

Wait, but wait—another thought: the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational. So the next state might be the first possible higher energy, which is the next vibrational state. No, that doesn't make sense because the first rotational state is lower in energy than the first vibrational state. So yes, the photon would cause a transition to J=1, v=0.

Wait, but wait again. The question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps it's the state with the next higher energy, which could be either increasing J or v. But in that case, I need to compute both energy differences and see which is lower.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only vibrational transitions because the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor. Oh, no, wait—the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. Hmm.

Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor model probably includes vibration. So the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational contributions.

But to determine whether the transition is rotational or vibrational, I need to compute which has a lower energy difference.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the energy of the ground state and the next possible states.

The ground state is v=0, J=0.

The next possible state is either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0.

Which one has a lower energy? Let's compute their energies.

The vibrational energy is E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

Wait, no, the standard expression is E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. So when v=0, E_vib = (1/2 h w). When v=1, E_vib = (3/2 h w).

The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J +1), where B is the rotational constant.

B is given by B = h/(8 π² c I), with I being the moment of inertia.

I is the moment of inertia, which for a diatomic is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ is (m_X m_Y)/(m_X + m_Y).

Given m_X is 20 amu, m_Y is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, we need to convert that to kg because when using SI units, the mass should be in kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's see, 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute more accurately.

1.818 * 1.6605:

1.8 *1.66 = 2.988.

0.018 *1.6605= about 0.02989.

So total is approximately 3.01789e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m
