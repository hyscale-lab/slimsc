Okay, so I have this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking about a photon's momentum needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The given data includes masses of X and Y, bond length, and angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that the rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so maybe that includes vibrational modes as well. Oh right, the quantum rotation-vibration model probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and given by something like E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But if we're including vibration, the energy would have both rotational and vibrational contributions.

But wait, the question specifies the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental vibrational state is the ground state, where the vibrational quantum number is zero (n=0). So for the next lowest state, maybe it's moving to the first vibrational excited state, n=1? Or perhaps transitioning to a higher rotational state while staying in the same vibrational state? Or maybe a combination of both?

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That suggests the next state is the one with the smallest increase in energy. So maybe the molecule is in its ground vibrational state and ground rotational state, and the photon excitation would cause the smallest possible jump, which might involve a transition to the next vibrational state or the next rotational state.

Wait, alternatively, the non-rigid rotor model might imply that the bond length can change, so the vibrational energy levels are considered. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state (n=0, J=0 maybe). But I'm a bit confused. Maybe the molecule is in the ground state of rotation and vibration, and the photon causes it to move to the next higher energy state.

The energy levels for a diatomic molecule usually have rotational and vibrational parts. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, the photon's energy would cause a transition between states. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

So, if the initial state is the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible energy state. The next state would be the next higher energy state, which could be the first vibrational excited state or the first rotational excited state. Which one has the lower energy difference?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

So the energy of the molecule combines both. The fundamental state is n=0 and J=0. The next possible state could be n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). Which has a lower energy difference?

Let's calculate both.

First, calculate the vibrational energy change. The energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w. Because E(n=1) - E(n=0) = (1 + 1/2) h w - (0 + 1/2) h w = h w.

Now, the rotational energy difference. For J=0 to J=1, it's E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B [1*(1+1)] - 0 = 2B.

So which is smaller: h w or 2B?

Hmm, I need to calculate B. The rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I = μ r², and μ is the reduced mass.

Given the masses Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So total mass is 22 amu. But we're looking for the reduced mass, μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) amu.

Wait, 20 and 2. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Now, bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R². Let's compute that.

μ = 1.818 amu. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = roughly 3.01e-27 kg.

I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2I). Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.204e-46)

Calculate numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.204e-46 ≈ 2.408e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.408e-46 ≈ 4.62e-23 J.

Wait, that's B. So the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is 2B = 9.24e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h w. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. w is 4e14 rad/s.

h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Compare that to 2B: 9.24e-23 J. Oh wait, no—wait, 2B is approximately 9.24e-23 J, which is much smaller than the vibrational energy difference. So switching to the next rotational state (J=1) requires less energy than switching to the next vibrational state (n=1).

But wait, wait. Are these the only possibilities? Because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state in both vibration and rotation. So the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

But if the photon has the least possible energy, then the molecule would absorb the photon that corresponds to the smallest energy difference. So between h w ≈ 2.65e-19 J and 2B ≈ 9.24e-23 J, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

Wait, but the question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state with the smallest energy jump would be the rotational one. So the photon's energy should be 2B.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Momentum p is related to energy E by E = pc for photons (since their mass is zero). So if the photon's energy is E_photon = 2B, then p = E / c.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. For a photon, energy E = h f, and momentum p = E/c, since h f = pc. So yes, p = E/c.

So the photon's momentum would be (2B) / c.

Wait, let me compute that.

E_photon = 2B = 9.24e-23 J.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.24e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.24e-23) / (3e8) = 3.08e-31 kg m/s. Hmm, but none of the options are that small. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, let me check the calculation of B again.

B = ħ² / (2 I)

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Then ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

Hm, so ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.204e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.408e-46 ≈ 4.62e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. So E_photon for the rotational transition is 2 * 4.62e-23 ≈ 9.24e-23 J.

So p_photon = E / c = (9.24e-23) / (3e8) ≈ 3.08e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options, none of them are this small. The smallest option is A) 1.9e-28 Ns. Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s. So 1.9e-28 Ns is 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, but my calculation gives 3.08e-31 kg m/s, which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest option. So something must be wrong here.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Maybe the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state, which is the ground state for vibration (n=0), but what about the rotational state? Maybe the fundamental state overall is the combination of n=0 and J=0.

If the molecule is in the ground state (both n=0 and J=0), then the next state could be either n=1 or J=1. But which transition is allowed? Because in spectroscopy, certain transitions are allowed based on selection rules.

Wait, for rotation-vibration transitions, the selection rules are typically ΔJ = ±1 and Δn = ±1. But for the fundamental state, which is n=0, J=0, the next state could be J=1, n=0 or n=1, J=0.

But since the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, that would be the one with the least energy difference.

Wait, but if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and ground rotational state, the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. So comparing the energy differences.

So, the vibrational energy difference is h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 2.65e-19 J.

The rotational energy difference (from J=0 to J=1) is 2B ≈ 9.24e-23 J, which is much smaller than the vibrational one. So the photon should have energy 2B. But wait, the options don't have such a small momentum.

Wait, maybe I messed up the model. Perhaps the molecule is treated in the non-rigid rotor model, which doesn't use the rigid rotor approximation. So maybe I should consider the bond length changing with vibration, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition where the photon provides both the vibrational and rotational energy. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) but in some rotational state J. But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, so that's n=0 and J=0.

So the next possible state is either n=1 and J=0 or n=0 and J=1.

Which of these transitions is lower in energy? As earlier, the J=1 transition is lower.

So the photon's energy must be 2B, which is E_rot = 2B = 9.24e-23 J.

Then, the photon's momentum is E/c = 9.24e-23 / 3e8 = 3.08e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns, which is 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg m/s. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the model includes both rotational and vibrational modes, but the question is about the total energy. Maybe the next state is a combination of a vibrational and rotational change, but that seems more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next energy level, not the smallest possible step. Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy", which implies the smallest possible energy difference, not the next in some sequence.

Wait another approach: Let's compute the vibrational energy difference and the rotational energy difference, and see which is smaller.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

E_rot = 2B ≈ 9.24e-23 J.

So E_rot is much smaller. So the photon's energy should be E_rot = 9.24e-23 J, which gives p_photon = E_rot / c ≈ 3.08e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, B is ħ²/(2I) where I = μ R².

Wait, compute I = μ R² again.

μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.818 * 1.6605 = Let's compute that. 1.8 * 1.66= approx 2.988. So μ≈3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m. So R squared is 4e-20 m².

I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Then, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s. So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.204e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.408e-46.

Let me compute this: 1e-68 / 1e-46 = 1e-22. So 1.112 / 2.408 ≈ 0.462, so 0.462e-22 = 4.62e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.24e-23 J. So E_photon is 9.24e-23 J.

Wait, but perhaps the model requires considering the vibrational contribution in the moment of inertia? Because in the non-rigid model, bond length varies with vibration. So perhaps the I used is time-dependent, but for the purpose of calculating B, it's the average value.

Wait, but no, the rotational constant B is based on the average bond length, which in the non-rigid model may be derived from the vibrational energy levels.

Alternatively, did I mix up the rotational and vibrational calculations? Let me think about the possible options.

Looking back at the options, the smallest momentum is option A: 1.9e-28 kg m/s. 1e-28 is much larger than my calculated 3e-31.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to cause a transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the next higher state, which is (n=1, J=0). So the energy difference would be E = h w + something? Wait, no, because if J remains the same, the rotational part doesn't contribute. So the energy change would be purely vibrational: h w.

Wait, but that would make the photon's energy E = h w = 2.65e-19 J.

Then p_photon = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is 8.83e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, close but not exact. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is also close.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated h w. Let me compute it again.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

w = 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-20 = 26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E / c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns. But none of the options match this exactly. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28), but neither is near.

Hmm, maybe I made an error in the selection of the transition. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be a higher vibrational state with J=0, but also perhaps some rotational state. But the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one with the smallest energy difference.

Wait, but if the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 9.24e-23 J, which is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

But that would make the photon's momentum 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the question is actually considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state (n=1), which would require a photon of energy h w.

But then why aren't the options matching that?

Wait, perhaps the given options have a mistake, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the model.

Wait another thought—maybe the molecule is considered as a rigid rotor, so the non-rigid part isn't affecting the calculation. So the energy difference for rotation is 2B, and for vibration is h w.

But if the question asks for the next state with the lowest energy, which is the one with the smallest energy difference, which is 2B. But that gives a momentum of 3e-31, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first excited vibrational state, but that's a higher energy than the rotational transition. But why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the molecule starts in a rotational state higher than J=0? No, the fundamental state is the ground state, which is J=0 and n=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but some rotational state, but the problem says "fundamental state", which is the combination of n=0 and J=0, I think.

Hmm. Another possibility: Maybe the question is about the transition to the next energy level, regardless of selection rules. So the next state is the one with n=1 and J=0. Then the energy difference is E = h w.

So the photon's energy is h w, and momentum is E/c = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is A) 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of this value.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from n=0, J=0 to n=0, J=1. So energy is 2B.

But then p_photon is 9.24e-23 / 3e8 = 3.08e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake with the units for angular frequency. Wait, angular frequency is given as 4e14 rad/s. Did I use it correctly?

Yes, E_vib = h w. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduced mass calculation is wrong. Let me recheck that.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the rotational constant calculation is incorrect because I used the wrong formula. Let me double-check. B = ħ²/(2I), where I is μ R².

Yes, that's the correct formula for B.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, maybe the question expects us to compute the vibrational transition, which is 2.
