Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the possible decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is the interaction term between the boson X and some fermions. So the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the Lagrangian looks like it's mediating such interactions.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written in a way that suggests that X is interacting with fermions. So the decay products would be fermion pairs. The possible decay modes depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it can decay into.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair it decays into must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of the decaying particle (that's the basic condition for decay being kinematically allowed).

So I need to list all possible fermion pairs where each fermion has a mass less than 3 GeV because each would contribute half the mass in the rest frame. Wait, no, actually, it's the sum of their rest masses. So for a fermion f and its antiparticle, the total mass would be 2m_f. So 2m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The Standard Model fermions include quarks and leptons. The masses vary:

- Up and down quarks: Their masses are about a few MeV to maybe around 5 MeV. Since they're so light, 2m is negligible—so X can definitely decay into uū or dđ pairs.

- Strange quark: Mass around 100 MeV to 500 MeV. So 2m is about 1-1 GeV. So that's way under 6 GeV. So sŝ is allowed.

- Charm quark: Mass around 1.5 GeV. 2m is about 3 GeV. So 3 GeV is under 6 GeV. So c c̄ is allowed.

- Bottom quark: Mass is about 4.5 GeV. Wait, 2m would be about 9 GeV. That's more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So b b̄ is not allowed because 9 GeV >6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Wait, but wait—what about the top quark? Oh, top is even heavier, but X is 6 GeV, so top is irrelevant. So the quark pairs allowed are u, d, s, c.

Then the leptons: 

- Electron (e): mass ~0.0005 GeV. So e+ e- is allowed.

- Muon (μ): mass ~0.1 GeV. So muon pair is allowed.

- Tau (τ): mass around 1.78 GeV. 2m is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau+ tau- is allowed.

What about the other leptons like neutrinos? Well, neutrinos have very tiny masses, but the problem doesn't mention them, and in the given Lagrangian, perhaps it's only considering charged fermions. Or perhaps the interaction only includes charged fermions since the problem doesn't specify otherwise. Also, in decay products, we usually see charged particles since neutrinos are neutral but also, their masses are negligible. But the options don't include neutrinos, so I can ignore them.

So the fermion pairs X can decay into are:

uū, dđ, sŝ, c c̄, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Wait, but the options given in the choices don't have all of these. Let me look at the options.

Option A: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

But wait, X can't decay into b b̄ because as I thought before, 2m_b is about 9 GeV which is higher than 6 GeV. So option A is out because it includes b b̄, which isn't allowed.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

So all these are allowed except for c c̄? Wait, no: c c̄ is allowed because 2m_c is about 3 GeV, which is less than 6. So option B includes c c̄, which is allowed.

But wait, B says c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, and then τ and mu and e pairs. So that seems correct except that I don't see any mention of top quarks, which is correct since they're too heavy.

Option C: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, t t̄, τ+ τ-, mu pair, e pair.

But t t̄ isn't allowed because 2m_t is way higher than 6 GeV. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b b̄ which is not allowed.

So the correct option would be the one that includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, and the leptons e, mu, tau. Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, let me double-check. Because c is 1.5 GeV, so 2c is 3 GeV, which is allowed. So all these options are in B.

Wait, but what about the charged lepton masses? Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2m is 3.56 GeV, which is allowed. So yes, tau pairs are allowed.

So the allowed decay channels are into c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, as well as all the charged lepton pairs.

So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay to be allowed, the total mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. Thus, the sum of the rest masses of the fermion and antifermion pair must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), meaning \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Quarks**:
   - **Up (\( u \)) and Down (\( d \)) Quarks**: Masses are negligible (a few MeV), so \( u\bar{u} \) and \( d\bar{d} \) are allowed.
   - **Strange (\( s \)) Quark**: Mass is approximately 350 MeV, so \( s\bar{s} \) is allowed.
   - **Charm (\( c \)) Quark**: Mass is approximately 1.5 GeV, so \( c\bar{c} \) is allowed.
   - **Bottom (\( b \)) Quark**: Mass is approximately 4.5 GeV, so \( b\bar{b} \) is **not allowed** because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Leptons**:
   - **Electron (\( e \))**: Mass is negligible (\( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( e^+e^- \) is allowed.
   - **Muon (\( \mu \))**: Mass is approximately 0.1 GeV, so \( \mu^+\mu^- \) is allowed.
   - **Tau (\( \tau \))**: Mass is approximately 1.78 GeV, so \( \tau^+\tau^- \) is allowed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+e^- \). All these decay modes are allowed. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark is much heavier than \( X \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
