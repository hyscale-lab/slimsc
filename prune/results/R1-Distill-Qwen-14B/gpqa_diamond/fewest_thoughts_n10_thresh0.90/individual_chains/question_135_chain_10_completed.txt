Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about particle decays. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is λf times the product of ψ_f and another term involving (v + X(y)). Wait, maybe I should focus more on the mass and the possible particles it can decay into.

The mass of boson X is 6 GeV. I remember that the mass of a boson is important because it determines what particles it can decay into. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the decaying particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. So, X can only decay into fermions whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Looking at the fermions, I think. The fermions include quarks and leptons. Let me list out the masses of these particles. Quarks come in different flavors: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. And leptons are electrons, muons, taus, plus their corresponding neutrinos.

Wait, the masses of the quarks are tricky because they are much lighter compared to some, but I think in the Standard Model, for decay purposes, we consider their rest masses. Let me recall approximate masses:

- Up and down quarks are about 2-5 MeV, very light.
- Strange is around 100 MeV.
- Charm is about 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom is around 4.5 GeV.
- Top is super heavy, like 173 GeV. So, way more than 6 GeV.

Leptons: 
- Electron is ~0.0005 GeV,
- Muon is ~0.1 GeV,
- Tau is about 1.77 GeV,
- Neutrinos are nearly massless, so their masses can be neglected.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's see what pairs it can decay into.

First, consider quark-antiquark pairs. For each flavor, the sum of their masses must be <=6 GeV.

For up quark: 2 MeV each. So 2*2=4 MeV <<6 GeV. So yes, possible. Same with down and strange.

Charm quark: 1.5 GeV each. So 3 GeV total. 3 <6, so yes. So c cbar is allowed.

Bottom quark: each is about 4.5 GeV, so 4.5 +4.5=9 GeV. 9>6, so no. So X cannot decay into b bbar.

Top quark is way beyond, so no.

Now for leptons: pairs like e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Tau is 1.77 GeV each, so 3.54 GeV total. 3.54 <6, so allowed.

Muons: 0.1 GeV each. 0.2 GeV. So allowed. Similarly, electrons are even lighter.

So possible lepton pairs are e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

What about neutrinos? Well, their masses are negligible, so X could in theory decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs. But the problem is, the Lagrangian given... Wait, the interaction term is written as -λf f_bar (y) (v+X(y)) ψ_f(y). So I think ψ_f is a fermion field. So the interaction is proportional to λ times some Yukawa coupling, but the exact form might determine which fermions can couple to X.

Wait, the interaction term might be important because only fermions that have a non-zero coupling with X can decay into them. So looking at the Lagrangian: the interaction is with ψ_f, which is a fermion field. So which fermions does X interact with?

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f fbar (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I misread that. Oh wait, maybe it's more like -λ ψ_f^dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but the LaTeX is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the term is something like -λ (v + X) ψ_f^dagger ψ_f. Wait, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term, where X is a scalar field coupling to a fermion field ψ_f. So the interaction is between X and ψ_f. So the fermions that X can decay into must be those that have a non-zero Yukawa coupling, i.e., the fermions ψ_f.

So for the decay X → f fbar, it's allowed only if X can couple to f. So which fermions have a non-zero coupling?

The possible fermions are the ones listed in the Lagrangian term. So ψ_f is the fermion field, which could be any of the known fermions, depending on the context.

Wait, the problem statement doesn't specify which fermions ψ_f are. So perhaps the interaction is with all possible fermions? Or maybe only some of them.

Wait, the question says what are the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So kinematically allowed means that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of X.

But for X to decay into a specific fermion pair, the fermion must have a non-zero coupling with X.

So two factors here: kinematics and coupling.

Kinematics: for each possible fermion pair, whether their combined mass is ≤6 GeV.

Coupling: whether X couples to that fermion.

So for each fermion f, if the mass of f is less than M_X/2 (since two fermions are produced), then kinematically allowed. And if the coupling is non-zero, then allowed.

So in our case, X can decay into any fermion f where m_f ≤ 3 GeV, and X couples to f.

But what fermions does X couple to? The problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, which is a Yukawa interaction. So X couples to ψ_f, which is a fermion.

The problem doesn't specify which fermions ψ_f are. So perhaps X couples to all possible fermions except maybe the top quark or others, but given that the mass is 6 GeV, which is lower than the top quark's mass, X can't decay into top quarks anyway.

Wait, but the options given include various fermion pairs. Let me look at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, bottom quarks are 4.5 GeV each, so 9 GeV total. X is 6 GeV. So b quarks can't be decay products because their combined mass would exceed X's mass.

So option A includes b bbar which is impossible. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, c quarks are 1.5 GeV each, sum is 3 GeV. So that's allowed. So c cbar is allowed, but what about tau pairs? Tau is 1.77 GeV each. 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so allowed. So option B includes c cbar, which is allowed, as well as others.

But wait, what about the coupling? X must couple to each of these fermions. So in the Lagrangian, the interaction is with fermion ψ_f. So if the ψ_f includes all the quarks and leptons, then X can decay into any of them with m_f <3 GeV.

So fermions with m_f <3 GeV (since X is 6 GeV, each product can be up to 3 GeV). So let's list the possible fermions:

- Up quark: 2 MeV → yes.
- Down: ~5 MeV → yes.
- Strange: ~100 MeV → yes.
- Charm: 1.5 GeV → yes, since 1.5*2=3 GeV <=6 GeV.
- Bottom: 4.5 GeV → no, as 4.5*2=9>6.
- Top: way beyond.

Leptons:

- Electron: 0.0005 GeV → yes.
- Muon: 0.1 GeV → yes.
- Tau: 1.77 GeV → 3.54 GeV <=6 → yes.
- Neutrinos: mass negligible → yes, but their decay would involve neutrinos, but in terms of rest mass, it's allowed. But in reality, neutrinos are light, but in the Lagrangian, is the coupling there? The problem's Lagrangian includes ψ_f, which I think is any fermion, so yes.

But the options don't include neutrino pairs. The options have e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, and quarks.

So possible decay products are:

Quarks: u, d, s, c.

Leptons: e, mu, tau.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

So all of these have pair masses under 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

Option C: includes t tbar. No, because 173 GeV each, way over.

Option D: includes b bbar. No, because 4.5 GeV each.

So, between options B and D. Option D has b bbar, which isn't allowed. So option B is a possible.

Wait, but what about the coupling? The interaction is given, but does it imply that X couples to all those fermions?

Assuming that the Lagrangian term allows X to couple to all the fermions in ψ_f. So any fermion that can be part of ψ_f would be allowed. Since the problem doesn't limit ψ_f, perhaps X can interact with all fermions.

But wait, the question is about the kinematical possibilities. So regardless of the coupling, whether the decay is kinematically possible. Because if the mass allows, then it's possible. But actually, no. Because even if the mass allows, if the coupling is zero, it can't decay. So we have to consider both factors.

Wait, the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So the possible decay products are the fermions that X couples to, and for whom the mass is allowed.

So, if X couples to all fermions (like the Standard Model Higgs), then all the fermions with mass <=3 GeV are allowed.

But in the Lagrangian, the interaction is λ f fbar (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, perhaps the notation is a bit confusing. Let me parse the Lagrangian again.

The given Lagrangian is:

L(y) = -λ f fbar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, perhaps it's supposed to be L = -λ ψ_f^dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), which would be the Yukawa interaction term. So the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ_f, meaning that X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f bar.

So ψ_f could be any fermion. So the decay X → f fbar is allowed if:

1. The mass of X is at least twice the mass of f.

2. The fermion f is one of the fermions that X couples to, i.e., is ψ_f in the Lagrangian.

Assuming that in this problem, X couples to all possible fermions (since the problem doesn't limit it), then the decay is allowed for any fermion with m_f <=3 GeV.

So looking at the options, option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. All of which have m_f <=3 GeV.

Option D includes b bbar, which is not allowed because 4.5*2=9>6.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the quark masses because sometimes it's easy to mix MeV and GeV.

Charm quark: about 1.2-1.5 GeV. So 1.5 * 2 =3 GeV ≤6 GeV: allowed.

Bottom quark: each is about 4.5 GeV. 4.5 *2=9 GeV >6 GeV: not allowed.

Top quark is way too heavy. So in the options, only c quark is allowed among the heavy quarks.

So the allowed fermion pairs are those with f being u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Thus, the decay products include c cbar, which is in option B.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option D includes b, which is wrong.

So the correct answer must be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \), and the decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is allowed if:

1. The combined rest mass of the decay products \( f \bar{f} \) is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), which implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
2. The fermion \( f \) has a non-zero coupling to \( X \), as dictated by the Lagrangian.

The approximate masses of the fermions are as follows:
- Up (\( u \)) and down (\( d \)) quarks: \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \).
- Strange (\( s \)) quark: \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \).
- Charm (\( c \)) quark: \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \).
- Bottom (\( b \)) quark: \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \).
- Top (\( t \)) quark: \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not relevant here).
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \).
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \).
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \).

From these masses:
- \( u \), \( d \), \( s \), and \( c \) quarks satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \) are allowed.
- \( b \) quarks are excluded because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
- \( t \) quarks are excluded because their mass is far greater than 6 GeV.
- \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( \tau^+ \tau^- \) are allowed because their combined masses are \( \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

The interaction term in the Lagrangian implies that \( X \) couples to all fermions \( \psi_f \), so the kinematic constraints alone determine the allowed decays.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is kinematically forbidden because \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden. **Incorrect**.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) with \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
