Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. The period is three times shorter, so Planet_1's period is P1 = P2/3. The host stars have the same radius, but the star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star.

Wait, but how does the mass of the star affect the transit probability? I think the transit probability also depends on the orbital distance. Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The period relates to the semi-major axis of the orbit. The law says P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets have the same mass (and much smaller than the stars), we can approximate M as the star's mass. So P² is proportional to a³/(M). 

So for Planet_1, P1 = P2/3. Let's set P1 = P2/3. Let me denote the star of Planet_1 as M1 and Planet_2's star as M2. Given that M1 = 2*M2.

Using Kepler's third law for each planet:

For Planet_1: (P1)^2 = (4π²/(G M1)) * a1^3

For Planet_2: (P2)^2 = (4π²/(G M2)) * a2^3

Divide Planet_1's equation by Planet_2's:

(P1²)/(P2²) = (M2/M1) * (a1³)/(a2³)

But P1 = P2/3, so ( (P2/3)^2 )/(P2²) ) = (1/9) = (M2/(2*M2)) ) * (a1³/a2³ )

Simplify: 1/9 = (1/2) * (a1³/a2³ )

Multiply both sides by 2: (2/9) = a1³/a2³

So a1³ = (2/9) * a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

What's the cube root of 2/9? Well, 2 is about 8, 9 is 27. Wait, 2/9 is (2)/(3^2). Hmm, cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. So (2/9)^(1/3) is approximately 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 * a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

The transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital size to the star's radius. The probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_star * sqrt( ... ))). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall the formula properly.

The transit probability, P, is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (e * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that term becomes 1/(sqrt(1)) = 1, so it's just (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the chance that the orbital plane is aligned. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, the actual probability formula also involves the impact parameter. Oh, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) ), but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is proportional to (R_s + R_p) / a, but for small planets, R_p is negligible compared to R_s, so it's approximately R_s / a. But wait, no, that's the geometric probability. The geometric probability of a transit is (R_p + R_s) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately (R_s / a) * (R_p / R_s)^2, or something like that. Maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, the actual geometric probability P is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, multiplied by the probability of alignment, which depends on the orbital inclination. Wait, no, I think the geometric probability is (R_p + R_s) / a. But no, that's the area of the star relative to the planet's orbit. So the probability is (R_s + R_p) / a. But since R_p << R_s, it's approximately R_s / a.

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to reconstruct it. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the area where this alignment can occur to the total possible area. The planet's orbit is a circle on the celestial sphere, and the star's disk is another circle. The probability is the area of overlap divided by something. Wait, perhaps the probability is (R_s + R_p)/(a), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability depends on (R_p + R_s)^2 / a^2, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because for a randomly oriented orbit, the chance that it passes in front is proportional to the ratio of the area the planet can block to the total area, but I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula for transit probability. I think the formula is P = (R_p / a) * (R_p / R_s)^2. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), but I'm really not sure. Alternatively, I think the geometric probability is (R_s + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approx R_s / a. So the transit probability is (R_s / a) multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. Wait, no, because the actual condition for
