Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Let me try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their density in space is the same everywhere. So, if I imagine looking out into the universe, stars aren't clustered more in one area than another.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/distance (in parsecs, I think). So as plx increases, the distance decreases.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So like, if I look at a slice of the sky with a certain parallax range, how does the count of stars in that slice change with plx?

When I'm thinking about this, I remember something about the distribution of stars in space and how parallax relates to distance. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region.

Let me think in terms of distance. For a given distance range, say from d to d + dd, the volume of that shell would be the surface area at that distance multiplied by the thickness dd. The surface area at distance d is 4πd² (since it's a sphere), so the volume is 4πd² dd. Therefore, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But parallax plx is related to distance d. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to d. Let me substitute that in.

If d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/plx². Also, dd (a small change in d) can be expressed in terms of plx. Let's see, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Since d is 1/plx, plugging that in: dd = - (1/(plx^2)) d plx. So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ - (1/plx²) d plx ].

Wait, but we're looking at the number of stars per unit range of plx. So let's think about the differential number of stars in a small range of plx. 

The number of stars (dN) in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd (which corresponds to a parallax change d plx) is given by the number density n times the volume of the shell. So:

dN = n * 4πd² dd

But since d = 1/plx, then:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd)

And we have dd in terms of d plx: from plx = 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² d plx = - (1/plx)^2 d plx.

Substituting back into dN:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ - (1/plx^2) d plx ]

Simplify that:

dN = n * 4π * (-1/plx^4) d plx

Since we're talking about the number per unit plx, we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates direction, but we're considering magnitude here). So:

dN/d plx = n * 4π / plx^4

Wait, that would mean the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait a second, that's for a thin shell. So if I consider a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, the number of stars in that range would be the integral of dN from plx to plx + dplx, which for small dplx is approximately (dN
