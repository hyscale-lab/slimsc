Okay, so I've got this question about stars' distribution in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think about this.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (plx) in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance of the star in parsecs. So, a star with a parallax of 1 parsec would be 1 parsec away, right? And as parallax decreases, the distance increases.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. So, that means the number density of stars is constant in space. But wait, how does that translate when we consider parallax?

I think I need to relate the number of stars within a certain distance range to the parallax. So, let's say we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. Each of these corresponds to a distance from d = 1/plx to d + dd, where dd = 1/(plx + dplx) - 1/plx. Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully.

Parallax (plx) is given by plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So if I have a small change in parallax, dplx, what does that mean for the distance? Let's see:

plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. 

Taking the derivative of d with respect to plx:

dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. 

So, a small change in plx leads to a small change in d, but negative because as plx increases, d decreases.

But I'm interested in the number of stars in a range of parallax. So, let's consider a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx. The corresponding distance shell is from d = 1/plx to d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ 1/plx - (1/plx²) dplx.

The volume of this thin shell in 3D space would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by the thickness dd. But wait, in a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume itself.

So the volume element is 4πd² * dd. Because the volume of a thin spherical shell is surface area (4πd²) times the thickness (dd).

But in terms of parallax, we can express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx, we can substitute:

Volume element, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ) 

But wait, since dplx is an increase, and dd is negative, maybe I should take the absolute value of the thickness. So, dV becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx, but wait, let me double-check.

Wait, let's do this step by step. The volume of the shell at distance d is 4πd² * (dd). And since dd is negative (because increasing plx means decreasing d), when we take the absolute value, it's positive.

So, dV = 4π (d)^2 * |dd| 

Substituting d = 1/plx and |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx² ) 

So, dV = 4π (d^2) * (dd) → 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2 dplx) )

Wait, that would make dV proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx. But wait, no, let me compute again.

Wait, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2)

Because dd = - (1/plx²) dplx, so |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

Putting it together:

dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) 

Which is 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

So, the number of stars in this volume element (dV) is proportional to dV because the stars are uniformly distributed (number density n is constant). So, number of stars, dN = n * dV.

So, dN = n * (4π dplx / plx^4 )

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So, if I take dN/dplx, that would be the number per unit plx.

Wait, no. Wait the question is "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?" 

Wait, per unit plx. So, the number in a range dplx around plx is dN = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2 ) → dN = 4π n (dplx) / plx^4.

So, the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about how this quantity changes with plx. So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean the answer is option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I might be getting confused. Let me think again. The number of stars per unit volume is n, a constant. So, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n*dV which is n*(4π d^2 dd). So, for a small dV, the number is n*4π d² dd.

But converting to plx, since d = 1/plx, and dd = -d^2 dplx (because dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx )

So, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2 dplx )

So, dV = 4π d^2 dd = 4π (1/plx^2)(1/plx^2 dplx )

So, dV = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

So, dN = n * (4π dplx / plx^4 )

Therefore, the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is, how does the number of stars per unit range of plx change with plx? So, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the higher the plx (closer the stars), the more stars per unit plx. But as plx decreases (stars are farther), the number per unit plx drops rapidly.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which matches.

So the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a thin shell of stars at distance \( d \), the corresponding range of parallax is from \( \text{plx} \) to \( \text{plx} + d\text{plx} \), which translates to a range in distance from \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) to \( d + dd \), where \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) (taking the absolute value for thickness).

The volume of this thin spherical shell is given by:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 |dd| = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = \frac{4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}
