Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry implies a certain type of symmetry. C3h is one of the point groups in molecular symmetry. Point groups are used to classify molecules based on their symmetry elements. The C3h group has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis (σh). So any molecule with a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane would belong to this group.

Let me look at the options given. The options are four molecules:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

Wait, I also need to remember what each of these molecules looks like. Let's go through them one by one.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. Borate usually has a boron atom with three substituents. Triisopropyl would mean that boron is connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a CH(CH3)2. So the structure would be something like B with three identical isopropyl groups attached. So symmetry-wise, does this have a three-fold axis? Because if each substituent is the same, perhaps. Wait, but the structure is trigonal planar around the boron? No, wait, boron usually has three substituents in a trigonal planar arrangement, but in a molecule like this, it's attached to three isopropyl groups. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis going through the boron, right? And any mirror planes? Well, if the molecule is symmetric across a plane perpendicular to that axis, then it would have σh. So if the molecule is symmetrical in such a way, then it would belong to C3h.

Alternatively, triisopropyl borate might have a C3
