Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle in a given superposition state.

Alright, the particle is in the state 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the Pauli z-matrix. The operator we're looking at is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value. Oh right, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state vector. So, I need to calculate this for our specific O and ψ.

Let me break it down. The operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x. So the expectation value will be 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩. So I can compute these two expectation values separately and then combine them.

First, let's find ⟨σ_z⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, this should be straightforward. For any state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σ_z is (a² - b²). Because σ_z |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩ and σ_z |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩. So the expectation value would be |a|² * 1 + |b|² * (-1) = |a|² - |b|².

Our state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So |a|² = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, |b|² = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4)=0.75. So ⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σ_z⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now onto ⟨σ_x⟩. Hmm, σ_x is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so I need to compute ⟨σ_x⟩ directly.

The Pauli x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σ_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. The expectation value ⟨σ_x⟩ is ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.

Let me compute this. The state |ψ⟩ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2)^T because |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So when I multiply σ_x with |ψ⟩:

σ_x |ψ⟩ is [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. 

Then, ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ multiplied by σ_x|ψ⟩. So |ψ⟩ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2), so the conjugate is the same because the coefficients are real. Multiply that by [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]:

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = 2*(0.5*sqrt(3)/2) )= (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 *2 = sqrt(3)/2 * 1 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660...

Wait, let me compute that again. The first term is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330. The second term is sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = same as first term, so 0.4330. Adding them gives 0.8660.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254.

So 5⟨σ_x⟩ is 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

Putting it all together, the total expectation value is (-5) + 4.3301 ≈ -0.6699.

Wait, that's approximately -0.67. Looking at the options:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

Hmm, -0.6699 is closest to -0.7, which is option C. But wait, let me recheck the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the σ_x computation. |ψ⟩ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. The operator σ_x acting on ψ gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. The inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

So that's 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330, and the second term is same, so sum is 0.8660, which is correct.

So 5 times that is about 4.3301. 10 times ⟨σ_z⟩ is -5. So -5 +4.3301 is -0.6699, which rounds to approximately -0.7.

So the correct answer should be option C) -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is given by:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
Since \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2 - |b|^2,
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Calculating:

\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75,
\]
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

Thus, \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator swaps \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), i.e., \( \sigma_x |\uparrow\rangle = |\downarrow\rangle \) and \( \sigma_x |\downarrow\rangle = |\uparrow\rangle \). The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]

Expressing \( |\psi\rangle \) as a vector, \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \), and applying \( \sigma_x \), we get:

\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866.
\]

Thus, \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, \( \langle O \rangle \approx -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The closest option is **C) -0.7**.
