Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They're using EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looking at the target gene's sequence. Some changes are in the first exon area. The goal is to eliminate the compound, which I assume means we need to disrupt the gene's function.

The intact gene and four mutants are provided. I need to figure out which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So the correct mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Hmm, comparing to the intact gene, let's see where the changes are. The first part is ATG TTT CT... in the wild type. In Mutant 1, it's ATG TTC TAC instead. So the third codon in the wild type is TTT (which is phenylalanine), and in the mutant, it's TAC which is tyrosine. That's a substitution, but not a frameshift. I don't see a stop codon here.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Again, let me compare. The wild type after ATG is TTT, then in Mutant 2 it's TTC TAAG. So instead of TTTCTC, it's TTC followed by TAA. Wait, the TAA is a stop codon. So the gene has a stop codon early on. Oh wait, wait. Let me look at the exact positions.

Wait, the original gene starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT… TGA.

Mutant 2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA... So after the ATG, which is the start codon, the next codons in wild type are TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), etc. In Mutant 2, the sequence after ATG is TTC (Phe), then TAA.

Wait, TAA is a stop codon. So the second codon after ATG is TTC (which is still Phe), and the next codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the gene would produce a much shorter protein because the translation stops at the second codon. That would likely disrupt the gene function, possibly eliminating the compound.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Comparing, the third codon in wild type is TCT (Ser), but in Mutant 3, it's TAC. Wait, let's see: the wild type after ATG is TTT CTC. So in Mutant 3, the sequence is TT TTA CGC... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look at the changes.

After ATG:
Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant 3: TT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, the first part is ATG TTT TAC GCT... No, wait the mutant 3's sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...

Wait, let me count the nucleotides. The first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT in wild type. In Mutant 3, it's ATG TTT TAC GCT... So the third codon in wild type is TTT (Phe), but in Mutant 3, after the second codon TTC (Phe), the third is TAC (which is Tyr). So that's another substitution. But not a stop codon. So it's a missense mutation, not a frameshift or a stop. So the protein would still have a longer sequence, just a different amino acid. So maybe a change in the protein, but not necessarily a loss of function unless it's a critical residue.

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Comparing: The wild type after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

In Mutant 4, after ATG, it's TTT TAC GCT ACT... So instead of GCT (Ala) and GGT (Gly), it's GCT ACT (Ala Thr). So that's a substitution, but again, not a stop codon. So the protein would be altered but might still function, depending on where the change is.

So the question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. That likely means disrupting the gene's function. So any mutation that introduces a premature stop codon would be a good candidate. Also, any large deletions or frameshifts that change a lot of the downstream amino acids could disrupt the protein.

Looking at the options:

Mutant 2 has a TAA stop codon early in the gene. So that would cause the mRNA to be translated into a very short peptide, which might not function at all. This is likely to disrupt the gene's function.

Mutant 1 has a substitution; same with Mutant 3 and 4. So the only one that introduces a stop codon is Mutant 2. So the correct answer would be Mutant 2, which is option A.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant 3

C) Mutant 1

D) Mutant 4

So the answer is A.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can happen if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon or significantly alters the protein structure.

### Analysis of the Mutants:
1. **Intact Gene**:  
   The sequence starts with `ATG`, the universal start codon, followed by `TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`. This represents a functional gene.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   The sequence changes from `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA` to `ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`.  
   - The third codon changes from `TTT` (Phe) to `TAC` (Tyr), which is a missense mutation.  
   - No premature stop codon is introduced, so the protein may still function.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   The sequence changes from `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA` to `ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`.  
   - After the start codon `ATG`, the sequence becomes `TTC TAA`.  
   - `TAA` is a stop codon, which introduces a premature termination of translation. This results in a much shorter, non-functional protein, effectively disrupting the gene's function.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   The sequence changes from `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA` to `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`.  
   - The third codon changes from `TCT` (Ser) to `TAC` (Tyr), and subsequent codons are altered.  
   - These are missense mutations, and no premature stop codon is introduced. The protein may still function, albeit with some changes.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   The sequence changes from `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA` to `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`.  
   - The sequence after `ATG` becomes `TTT TAC GCT ACT`.  
   - These are missense mutations, and no premature stop codon is introduced. The protein may still function, albeit with some changes.

### Conclusion:
The only mutation that introduces a premature stop codon is **Mutant 2**, which contains the stop codon `TAA` early in the sequence. This would disrupt the gene's function and likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. 

**Answer: A**
