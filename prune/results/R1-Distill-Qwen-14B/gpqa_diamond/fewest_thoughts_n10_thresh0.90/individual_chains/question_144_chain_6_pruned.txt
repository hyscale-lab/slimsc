Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay has something to do with their mean lifetime and their velocity. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me the production energy E_X of 8 GeV, the mass m_X of 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X of 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and how fast it's moving.

First, I remember that the mean lifetime (tau) is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty and Δt is the time uncertainty. For a particle, the width Γ is like the energy uncertainty, right? So Γ ≈ ħ / tau. Wait, but I think the actual formula is tau = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime. So tau is ħ divided by Γ.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the formula Γ = ħ / τ. So solving for τ gives τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, I think that's correct.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV. Oh, right, since ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Or maybe I should convert everything into compatible units. Let's see. I need to calculate τ in seconds, then find the velocity of the meson, and then multiply the two to get the decay distance.

So first, I'll compute τ. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is 320 MeV. Oh wait, I need to convert Γ from MeV to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So,

τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is... 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, I need the velocity of the meson. For that, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is given, and the rest mass is known. The kinetic energy plus rest mass energy gives the total energy.

Wait, the relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c^2. So gamma is E/(m c²), but since E and m are given in the same units (GeV), I can compute gamma as E / m. So gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

But I'm not sure about that. Wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by m c². So yes, gamma = E / (m c²), and since E and m are in GeV, and in natural units where c=1, then E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c². Wait, but when you have E = gamma m c², and in units where c=1, E = gamma m. So, gamma is E/(m). So in this case, 8 GeV divided by 1.2 GeV is 6.666..., so gamma is about 6.6667.

Now, the velocity beta is v/c. To find beta, I can use the relation between gamma and beta. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So solving for beta:

gamma² = 1/(1 - beta²) → 1 - beta² = 1/gamma² → beta² = 1 - (1/gamma²) → beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So plugging in gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.6667.

Calculating 1/gamma^2: (1/6.6667)^2 is approximately (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is around 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887. So the velocity is 0.9887c.

Wait, let me get more precise. Let me compute it accurately.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666
