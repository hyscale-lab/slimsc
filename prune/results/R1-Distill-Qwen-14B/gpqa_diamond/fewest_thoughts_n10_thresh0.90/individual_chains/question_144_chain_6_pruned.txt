Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's try to work through it.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor times the lifetime. Because the particle is moving relativistically, right?

So the mean decay length L is given by L = c * γ * τ. But how do I find τ, the proper lifetime?

Proper lifetime τ is related to the particle's width Γ. The uncertainty principle comes into play here, right? Γ is the energy width, which is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, no, I think it's τ = ħ/(Γ), but wait, units can be tricky. Let me think.

Oh, right, the natural line width formula: Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty ΔE. So using ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). So that's the proper lifetime.

But wait, since the particle is moving at high speed, we have to account for time dilation. So the observed lifetime is τ' = γ τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So putting it together, L = c * γ τ. But τ is ħ/(Γ c^2), wait, wait. Let me get the units right. Γ has units of energy, so to get τ in seconds, we need to divide by ħ. Yes, because ħ is in units of GeV·s. So Γ in GeV, so ħ/Γ gives time.

Wait, let's write the formula correctly. Γ is in GeV, and ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056
