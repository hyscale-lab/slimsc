Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, let's break it down step by step because I'm a bit confused about where to start.

The question is about the Sun's neutrino production, specifically when the pp-III branch stops. Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. There are different branches, right? The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh, right! The pp-III branch involves heavier elements because it requires more protons. I think it's the one that produces Be-7, which then goes on to become B-8 and emits neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, that would affect the production of those neutrinos. But wait, the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So other branches like pp-I and pp-II are still active. But I think only pp-III produces a certain type of neutrino, or maybe a specific energy range?

Neutrinos from the Sun are mostly electron neutrinos, and their energies depend on the reaction. For the pp-III branch, the neutrinos come from the decay of Beryllium-8, which then becomes two protons and a positron, emitting a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is around a few hundred keV. I think the main pp-III neutrinos are in the 700-800 keV range, maybe? Or wait, maybe the pp-I and pp-II don't contribute to neutrinos as much. Or do they?

Wait, the pp-I and pp-II might not produce as many neutrinos. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh wait, the dominant neutrino emission comes from the pp-III branch. So if pp-III suddenly stops, the production of the high-energy neutrinos (maybe in the 700-800 keV range) would drop, but other neutrinos from other sources might not be affected as much.

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two bands: 700-800 (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, if the pp-III branch stopped, how does that affect each band?

I think the pp-III branch emits neutrinos in the 400-800 keV range or something like that. Wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me think. The main solar neutrinos come from the decay of Beryllium-8, which has a half-life of about 7 seconds. The neutrinos from that decay have energies around 1.4 MeV? Or wait, no, that's maybe the energy of the peak. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have energies around 400-800 keV? Or 700-800? Hmm, I'm a bit unsure.

But the problem here is that the pp-III branch stopped. So if the pp-III is the main source for the neutrinos in band 1 (700-800), then the flux in band 1 would drop. What about band 2 (800-900 keV)? Are those from the same source? Or maybe from higher-energy processes?

Wait, another possibility: if pp-III stops, maybe the neutrino production in higher energies would be affected more. Or perhaps the flux in band 1 (which depends on pp-III) would drop, so the ratio (flux1/flux2) would decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino flux in band 2 comes from a different source. For example, other reactions like the oxygen-nitrogen cycle or other branches might emit neutrinos in higher energy ranges. But wait, I think the oxygen cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III is the main contributor to neutrinos in band 1, and the oxygen cycle contributes to higher energies, then stopping pp-III would affect band 1 more than band 2.

Wait, but if the question is only stopping pp-III and not the other processes, then other neutrino sources (like the CNO cycle) would still emit neutrinos as usual. So if band 1 is mainly from pp-III, and band 2 is from a different source (like CNO), then the flux in band 1 would drop a lot, but band 2 would remain the same. So the ratio flux1/flux2 would drop.

But the options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. So if the flux in band 1 goes to nearly zero, the ratio would be nearly zero. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes to both bands, but more to band 1 than band 2. So if it stops, both bands' fluxes decrease, but band 1 more than band 2. So the ratio would decrease.

Wait, maybe the pp-III neutrinos peak around lower energies, so band 1 is more affected. Let's think about the solar neutrino spectrum. I remember that the most abundant neutrinos are around 400-600 keV, but the question's bands are higher: 700-800 and 800-900. So maybe those higher energy neutrinos come from a different process.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about what the pp-III branch contributes. The pp-III chain is the main source of Be-7, which then captures a proton to form B-8, which then decays into two protons and a positron, emitting a neutrino. The decay of B-8 produces a neutrino with an energy around 1.4 Me
