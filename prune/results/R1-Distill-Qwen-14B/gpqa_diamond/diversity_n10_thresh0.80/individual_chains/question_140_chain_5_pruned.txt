Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question seems a bit involved, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. Let me parse the information given.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. I remember that isotopes have the same number of protons but different neutrons, so the element is the same, but with a higher mass number. So maybe X is a compound where one of the elements is a heavier isotope. For example, maybe something like Cl-35 vs Cl-37, but heavier would be Cl-37. Not sure yet.

The reaction is violent, releasing a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule. So, the molecule's formula would be where the number of protons (from each atom) equals the number of neutrons (from each atom) in the molecule.

Wait, no, wait. Each molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule, total protons equals total neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. For example, H2O has 8 neutrons (O has 8, H has 0 each) and 8 protons (O has 8, H has 1 each, total 10. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe something else.

Wait, if each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, maybe something like CO2? No, CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons in the common isotope), O has 8 each. So each CO2 molecule has (6+8*2) protons =6 +16=22. Neutrons would be 6 (from C) + 8*2=22. Wait, that adds up. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons in each molecule. Oh, but wait, that's for the common isotopes. But the problem says the molecule's neutrons and protons are equal. So another example: H2O. Each molecule has (2 H atoms, each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons, and O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons). So total protons in H2O: 2 +8=10. Total neutrons:
