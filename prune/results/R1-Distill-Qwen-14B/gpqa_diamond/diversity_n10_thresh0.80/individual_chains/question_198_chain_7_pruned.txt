Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it again and think through the steps.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. 

Hmm, wait, stability constants are for the formation of different complexes. So Co(II) can form complexes with SCN- in different stoichiometries. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n varies. The stability constant β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of each complex.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So that's the species with two SCN- ligands. Wait, but wait, what are the stability constants for each complex.

Wait, the stability constants are given for β1 to β4. I think the numbering is such that βn corresponds to the complex with n SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^0 perhaps, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2−? Or maybe I'm getting the charges wrong. Let me think: Co^2+ can form complexes with SCN-.

Each SCN- is -1 charge. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 - n). Because Co is +2 and each SCN is -1, so total charge is 2 -n.

Wait, let's see:

n=1: Co(SCN) → charge is +2 -1 = +1 → [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → 2+ - 2*(−1) = 2+ − (-2) = 0 → neutral. β2=40.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^− → 2+ −3*(-1) = 2+ +3 = +5? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, 2+ minus 3*(-1) is 2 +3= +5. Oh wait, but that would give [Co(SCN)_3]^−? No, wait, 2+ plus 3*(-1) would be 2+ -3 = -1. Oh, right, because each SCN is -1. So for n=3, the charge is 2+ + (-1)*3 = -1. So [Co(SCN)_3]^−. β3=63.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2− → 2+ +4*(-1)= 2-4= -2. So [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. β4=16.

Wait, but the β4 is 16, which is lower than β2 and β3. Hmm, that
