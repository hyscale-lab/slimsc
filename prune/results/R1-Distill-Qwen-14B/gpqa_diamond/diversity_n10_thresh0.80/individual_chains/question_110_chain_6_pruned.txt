Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question gives some key points about their capabilities. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17, while HIRES can see stars brighter than 16. So, each has their own limit. Wait, so a star needs to be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES? Or wait, no. The wording says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Oh wait, no, magnitude scale is inverted. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would mean magnitude less than 17. Because higher magnitude means dimmer. So, for example, a star with V magnitude 16 is brighter than one with 17.

So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitude up to 17, but not brighter than that? Or wait, the way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because 'brighter than 17' would mean magnitude less than 17. But in reality, higher magnitude means fainter. So "brighter than 17 mag" would be stars with magnitude less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars up to 17 magnitude. So any star with V mag ≤ 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe up to 16 mag, so V mag ≤ 16.

Wait, but wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Oh, I think there's a confusion here. Because in astronomy, a star's brightness is measured as magnitude. The lower the magnitude, the brighter it is. So, if a star is brighter than 17, its apparent V magnitude is less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, it can see stars with V up to 17. So, any star with V < 17 would
