Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal structures, part of the cubic system maybe? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system? Or is it a separate category? I'm a bit fuzzy on the crystal systems. Wait, I think rhombohedral has all sides equal but the angles are not 90 degrees. Oh right, it's a special case where a = b = c, but the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a crystal structure would correspond to the lattice parameter, right? Or maybe it's the same as the unit cell edge length. I think in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to a. But in other structures, maybe it's different. Wait, but for this problem, perhaps the interatomic distance given is the lattice parameter a. So a=10 Angstrom.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. So this is a rhombohedral structure with all angles 30 degrees. The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by 1/d^2 equals the sum of (h²/l² + k²/m² + l²/n²) divided by a², but wait, no, that's for cubic systems. Wait, no, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is more complicated when the crystal isn't cubic, because of the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - ... )) but I'm getting a bit confused. Oh wait, the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is something like d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) )) ? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

I think the correct formula for the interplan
