Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So it's probably describing some kind of surface.

I remember that the area of a surface in differential geometry can be found using the metric tensor. The area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this is two-dimensional, the metric tensor is just a 2x2 matrix, and the determinant would be the product of the diagonal terms minus the off-diagonal terms. But looking at the metric, it's diagonal because there are no cross terms like dx dy. So the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy².

Wait, but in this case, the coefficient is the same for both dx and dy. The metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So each of the diagonal terms of the metric tensor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant g would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))², because in 2D, the determinant for a diagonal metric is the product of the diagonal elements.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Oh wait, pseudosphere usually refers to the tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. But how does that tie into this metric?

Let me think about the metric more carefully. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². Wait, that looks familiar. If I consider the flat metric in polar coordinates, where x² + y² = r², so 4 - r². So the denominator becomes 4 - r².

The metric is then ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). Because in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

Wait, so this is a metric in polar coordinates. The line element is given in 2D, perhaps representing a space with a certain curvature.

The area of a surface in polar coordinates can be found by integrating the area element over the region. The area element
