Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up like they do in classical mechanics because of the speed limit c. So for relative speed, I probably need to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is the one from special relativity, right? The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). But wait, I think that's for when you're adding two velocities as observed from different frames. Oh wait, no, actually, that's the formula when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction, from the same frame, but you want to find the relative speed as seen from one astronaut's perspective. Or wait, maybe each is in their own frame, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed between them would be the difference of their speeds, but adjusted for relativity. So I can't just subtract them normally. Let me recall the formula properly.

The correct formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, no, if u is the speed of one object in the other's frame, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, maybe I should be careful. Let me think: if object A is moving at u in the lab frame, and object B is moving at v in the lab frame, then in A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Because from A's perspective, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference in their speeds, but divided by that denominator.

So in this problem, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 2?
