Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

So, the setup is that there are two stars, each with the same mass as our Sun. Astronomers found exoplanets around each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so they're probably gas giants or something like that. The orbits are circular, which might simplify things a bit.

The key point is about the spectral line shifts. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, while Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, wait. I'm a bit rusty on the RV method. From what I remember, the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves towards and away from us as the planet orbits, causing the spectral lines to shift back and forth. The amplitude of this shift (the velocity) depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the distance from the star. But since both stars are the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, maybe their velocities relate inversely to something else.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by a formula. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/2) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2))) ) ... Oh wait, maybe that's not quite right. Let me think. I think the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (4 π²) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )) ) ) multiplied by some other factors. Wait, perhaps I should recall the correct formula.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²))) )

But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So we can approximate this as:

K ≈ [ (G * M_p) / M_star ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But wait, since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so sqrt(1 - e²) is 1. So K ≈ [ (G * M_p) / M_star ]^(1/3) * (1 / P )

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Maybe it's better to look up the correct expression. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's velocity in response to the planet. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the planet's velocity. But since the planet
