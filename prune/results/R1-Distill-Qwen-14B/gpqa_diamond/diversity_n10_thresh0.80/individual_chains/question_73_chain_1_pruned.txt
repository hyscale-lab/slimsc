Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think it through.

First, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and the other 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So they're moving in the same direction.

The question asks for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, I remember that you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference divided by that factor.

Let me write down the formula correctly. If object A is moving at v1 and object B at v2 (both in same direction), the relative speed of A with respect to B is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2/c²)).

So plugging in the numbers: v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

So (0.6c - 0.5c) is 0.1c. Then denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) → 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1-0.3=0.7.

So relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 → approximately 0.1428c. Hmm, about 0.14c. That looks like option C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. Since the system's total energy is the sum of each astronaut's energy.

For the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². Hmm, that's approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options: option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So the energy part matches option C.

So the relative speed was approximately 0.14c, and the energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

Wait, but let me recheck the relative speed calculation. Using (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)) = 0.1 / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1 / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So yes, 0.14c is correct.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and energy is 5.96 mc². So looking at the options, option C matches both. So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.
