Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the area covered by the spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, as the star rotates, the brightness variations observed (the light curve) are due to this rotational modulation. The interesting part is that this situation can look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted otherwise.

So, the main goal is to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.

I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is given by the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because when the planet passes in front, it blocks a part of the star's light proportional to the area ratio.

But in this case, the star has spots, and the observed brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. The brightness change would depend on the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star. 

Wait, so the star is not uniform in temperature. Part of it is cooler. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total brightness will decrease because the spots are darker. As the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view and then goes away. This modulation creates a periodic change in brightness.

But the problem says that to produce the same amplitude in the light curve (if the star wasn't spotted), what exoplanet radius would be needed. So, the amplitude caused by the spots is compared to the amplitude that a planet transit would cause.

So first, I need to calculate the amplitude (ΔF) caused by the spots, and then set that equal to the transit depth (ΔF_planet) caused by the planet, and solve for Rp.

Wait, but how is the amplitude from the spots calculated? 

Let me think: The star's total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is F_0. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_1. The change in flux is F_0 - F_1, which causes the dip in brightness.

The star's radius is Rstar, so the total surface area is 4π Rstar². The spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² / 2? Wait, wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the star is a sphere. Each hemisphere has a surface area of 2π R². If one hemisphere is covered 20% (filling factor) by spots, so the area covered is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4π R².

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so
