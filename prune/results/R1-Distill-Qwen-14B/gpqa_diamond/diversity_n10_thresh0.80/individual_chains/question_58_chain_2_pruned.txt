Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Let me start by recalling what I know about regularization and each of these theories.

Regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are like infinities that pop up in calculations, which don't make physical sense. So, you "regularize" the theory by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method to make the calculations finite, and then you take the cutoff away in the end. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or have no divergences.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything. It deals with particles as strings vibrating. I'm not too sure about regularization here. Wait, I think string theory has a different approach. Oh right, in superstring theory, especially when it's quantized, it's supposed to be finite. So maybe it doesn't require regularization because the infinities cancel out. Or maybe it has some other way of handling these issues without the same kind of divergences.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes weaker because of asymptotic freedom. Wait, but regularization is needed because of things like loop divergences. I remember that QCD does require renormalization, which suggests it has divergences that need handling. So regularization would be necessary here.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED has issues with divergences, especially in higher-order loop diagrams. For example, the calculation of the electron self-energy has these divergences. So QED definitely requires regularization and renormalization. Without them, the theory isn't predictive. So this theory isn't the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't really have these kinds of divergences in the same way. Oh, but wait, classical ED does have some issues, like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. For example, the electric field of a point charge leads to an infinite energy. But in classical ED, do we handle this with regularization? Or is it not a problem because we don't do quantum calculations? Because regularization
