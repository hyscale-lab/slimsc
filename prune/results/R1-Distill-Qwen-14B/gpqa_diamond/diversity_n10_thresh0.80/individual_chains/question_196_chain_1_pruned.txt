Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I need to find the maximum speed. Let's start by recalling what I know about harmonic oscillators and relativistic effects.

Alright, in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has potential energy U = ½ kx². The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, ½ mv² = ½ kA². Solving for v gives v = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question says it's relativistic, so I can't just use the classical formula. Oh right, relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The correct expression for kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to set the total energy equal to this relativistic kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy.

Wait, the total mechanical energy in the harmonic oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the potential energy also might get modified. Or does it? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², given that the question states F = -kx, so it's the same as the classical case.

So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², right? Because at maximum displacement x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so all energy is potential. So E = ½ kA².

In the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at x=0 (the equilibrium point), all energy is kinetic. So (γ - 1)mc² = E = ½ kA².

Hmm, let's write that equation:

(γ - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A²

So, γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so let's substitute that:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as a term for simplicity. Let's call it term S. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + S

Solving for v. Let's square both sides to get rid of the square root:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + S)^2

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + S)^2

Wait, let me double-check that inversion. If 1/(a) = b, then a = 1/b.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/( (1 + S)^2 )

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + S)^2 ]

Factor that,

v²/c² = [ (1 + S)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + S)^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2S + S² -1 ) → 2S + S².

So,

v²/c² = (2
