Okay, so I've got this physics problem about angular momentum operators, and I need to figure out the correct option among A, B, C, or D. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator A is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The equation given is Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0).

So the first thing I need to do is write down the matrix Ay. Let me compute that. 

c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So the matrix S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So when multiplied by c, Ay becomes:

[ 0*(h/(4π))   (-i)*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0*(h/(4π)) ]

So Ay matrix is:

[ 0       -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  0      ]

Wait, that's correct. Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue.

So the matrix (Ay - λ I) is:

[ -λ           (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))   -λ         ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating determinant: λ² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the term is (1)*(h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So λ² = (h²)/(16 π²), so λ = ± h/(4π). Hmm, wait wait. Wait, h/(4π) is the value of c, which is the constant in front. So the eigenvalues a are ± c, which is ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real numbers: +h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So looking at the options, which one says that?

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, but eigenvalues are real numbers here. So their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is wrong because it says the imaginary parts are ±2πh. That can't be right.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that doesn't match. My calculation shows real eigenvalues, so their imaginary parts are zero. So B is wrong too.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well
