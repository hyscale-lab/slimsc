Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. Hmm, parallax and distance are related, right? I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh yeah, the formula is parallax (in parsecs) equals 1 over distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I'm thinking, the number of stars depends on the parallax as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since I know plx is 1/r, substituting that in would give N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), so 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power? But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because I thought higher parallax means closer stars, so if you look at a larger distance, you should see more stars, but the relation here is showing a strong dependence.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number changes per unit range of distance. Oh, so it's the change in the number of stars for a small change
