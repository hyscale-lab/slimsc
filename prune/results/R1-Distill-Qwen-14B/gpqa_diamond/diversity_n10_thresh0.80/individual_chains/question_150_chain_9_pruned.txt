Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let me try to walk through this step by step.

First, let's look at the molecular formula of the compound: C8H9NO. Hmm, so that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. The degrees of unsaturation might help. Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and a double bond or ring plus a double bond. 

The H-NMR data is given: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let's try to interpret this.

The peak at 9.72 is a triplet integrating to 1H. Triplet implies coupling with two neighboring protons. A triplet at around 9-10 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton (-CHO). So that's probably a conjugated aldehyde, maybe part of an enal.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). These could be para-substituted aromatic protons. So perhaps two aromatic rings, each with two protons as doublets. That would suggest that each ring is para-substituted. Wait, but the integration for these is 2H each. So each aromatic ring has two equivalent protons. So maybe two para-substituted phenyl groups attached to something else.

Then, the 6.27 (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an acidic proton, or perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, it could be protons on a double bond adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system. Or maybe it's an enol proton. Hmm. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted double bond. Wait, but 2H as a singlet... Wait, no, a singlet would mean no neighboring Hs. Oh, but that's not possible for double bonds. Unless it's part of a conjugated system where the Hs are equivalent. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the protons to be deshielded but equivalent. Not sure yet.

The 3.66 (d, 2H) is a doublet integrating to 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative. Maybe an oxygen, like an ether or ester. Or perhaps a CH2 connected to a carbonyl group. The doublet suggests each proton is next to one other proton. So maybe a CH2 with two neighboring protons, like part of a chain. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 between two carbonyls, but that's not likely. Another possibility is a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2... but I'm not sure yet.

Putting this together, the structure might have two para-substituted phenyl groups, a double bond, and an aldehyde group. Let me think of possible structures. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So if it's two phenyl groups (each C6H5), that's C12, but our compound is C8. So maybe it's not two phenyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps one phenyl group and another substituent.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Maybe it's a phenyl group attached to a smaller chain. Let's think:
