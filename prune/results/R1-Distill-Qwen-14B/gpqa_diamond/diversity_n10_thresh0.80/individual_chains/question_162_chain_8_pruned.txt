Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that a metric describes the geometry of spacetime, and in this case, it's looking like a 2-dimensional space because it's only involving dx and dy. So this is a 2-sphere or something similar? Or maybe it's a hyperbolic space?

Wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. In contrast, a regular sphere has positive curvature. So I think the metric here might represent a space with negative curvature, which would align with a pseudosphere.

The area of a pseudosphere... I remember the formula for the area of a sphere is 4πr², but since this is a pseudosphere, maybe the area is different. Wait, no, in 2D, the area is the integral over the surface, and for a pseudosphere, which is non-Euclidean, the area element would differ.

Let me think about the metric. The given metric is in the form of ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where g(x,y) is the coefficient. So this is a 2-dimensional metric, probably on a plane, but with a specific scaling factor that depends on x and y.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y²
