Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function.

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second. Wave functions in quantum mechanics are usually complex, but they have to satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, the integral of the probability density over all space should be 1, because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%.

So the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. Let's compute that. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that as ψ(x) = (a/√(1+x)) ) - (0.5)i.

The absolute square of ψ is ψ*ψ. So, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I square the absolute value:

|ψ|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + [0.5]^2. That's because (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b². Oh wait, but in our case, ψ is (a/√(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate would be (a/√(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when you multiply them, you get (a²)/(1+x) + (
