Okay, I've got this question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But how exactly does that probability work?

So the question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same minimum mass because they were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh right, shorter period means it's closer to its star since orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting because more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe Planet_2's star is slightly evolved and thus has expanded, keeping the radius similar despite higher mass. Or maybe not, but in this case they have same radii.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers would prefer to observe the one with higher probability.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, but wait, the planets here have the same mass, but not necessarily the same radius. Wait, wait, no, the question says both planets have the same mass, but it doesn't say anything about their radii. Oh but wait, the transit probability also depends on the orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is given by the formula: P = (R_star / a) * (1/(sqrt(1-e²))), where e is the orbital eccentricity. Since both orbits are circular, e=0, so the formula simplifies to P = R_star / a.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, another way to think about it: the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the planet needs to pass in front of the star's disk. A larger star increases the chance, and a smaller a (closer orbit) makes the transit more likely because the orbital plane has a higher chance of being edge-on.

So P is proportional to (R_star / a). But wait, actually, the formula I remember is P = (R*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²)))
