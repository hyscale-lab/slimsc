Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is a complex ion. The problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M, and I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

I think the key here is the formation constant, K. The formation constant (Kf) tells us how much the metal and EDTA will combine into the complex. The formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]): that's the equilibrium expression. Since Kf is very large (5e10), it means the complex is very stable and the reaction goes almost to completion.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I'm assuming that's the concentration at equilibrium. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I'm being asked about the concentration of free calcium ions.

Let me set up the variables. Let's denote:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M (since that's the given concentration)
Let [Ca²+] = x. We need to find x.
Let [EDTA^4-] = y.

But wait, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

So according to the K expression:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10

But I know that in a solution where the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will be related by this K.

Wait, but EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and in solution, it exists in various protonated forms. However, the problem states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that all the EDTA is in the Y^4-
