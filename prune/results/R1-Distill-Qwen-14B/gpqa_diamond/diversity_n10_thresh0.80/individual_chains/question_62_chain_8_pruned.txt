Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name suggests that there's a cyclohexane ring attached to a methyl group, and that methyl group has both a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. Also, there's a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part, which means a formyl (CHO) group attached to a cyclohexane ring. So, putting it together, the molecule has two cyclohexane rings connected via a CH(OH)CH2 group, and one of the rings has a CHO group.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The full name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is a cyclohexane ring (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group which is attached to both a cyclohexyl group (from the ethynylcyclohexane) and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane. So ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. The target molecule has a more complex structure.

I think the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, has a triple bond. So maybe we're going to do some kind of addition across the triple bond.

The target molecule's substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So perhaps the ethynyl group is going to be converted into something else.

Let me think about the steps involved in such a synthesis. Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond between two carbons. One of them is attached to the cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the triple bond is going to be functionalized.

I recall that triple bonds can undergo
