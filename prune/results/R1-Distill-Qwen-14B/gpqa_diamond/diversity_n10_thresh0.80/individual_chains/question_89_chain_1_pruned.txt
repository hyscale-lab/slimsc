Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think it through.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a very rigid molecule. The dibromo groups are on carbons 1 and 3. When you heat this with KOH in excess, that's probably an elimination reaction. Wait, no, wait. KOH is a strong base. Oh, right! When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-diX) react with KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps it's a different elimination because the structure is so rigid.

Wait, but heating dibromoadamantane with KOH might lead to a double elimination. Because each Br is on a separate carbon, maybe we lose both Brs and form two double bonds? No, wait, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination, but since there are two Br atoms, perhaps each one leaves a H and forms a double bond. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, that makes me think of epoxides. Wait, no, more likely an elimination to form an alkene, but wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product after KOH is probably a ketone or an ester. But wait, KOH is a base, so maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an epoxide? No, I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, producing an alkane with two double bonds? No, that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's an E2 elimination for each Br. Wait, but that would produce two HBr molecules and form a diene? Or perhaps a conjugated diene? But that might not explain the IR peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form an allene (conjugated diene with two double bonds).

But the IR at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a diketone? Wait, but how would that happen? Oh, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH, forming a diol? No, that's an addition reaction, not elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's an oxidation. Wait, no, KOH is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but since there are two Br atoms, maybe the structure undergoes a ring-opening. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so maybe when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you form a bridge or a ring with double bonds. Oh, wait, if the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, eliminating two HBr would form two double bonds, making an adamantylene structure, perhaps. But then again, the IR doesn't show a peak for a C=C. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, sometimes it can form an epoxide. Oh, but that would require adjacent Br atoms, which we don't have here (they're 1,3). So that's probably not it.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But substitution would require a good leaving group, and Br is a decent leaving group, but with KOH, it's more likely an elimination. Wait, but what if it's a double substitution? Replacing both Br with something else. Hmm, but what else? If KOH is present, maybe it's forming an oxide. Wait, but then we would have an oxygen bridge. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening to form a diol, but that would require a dihalide to react with something else, like water in an SN2 reaction. But in this case, KOH is providing hydroxide ions. So perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming 1,3-diol adamantane. But that gives a diol, which wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more consistent with a ketone. How do we get a ketone from this reaction? Maybe through oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm, unless there's an elimination followed by some kind of rearrangement. Wait, maybe the base deprotonates a beta-H, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group via elimination. Oh! That's possible. Wait, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH2 group, then elimination could form a ketone.

Wait, let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent C-C bonds break, leading to the formation of double bonds? No, but again, the IR suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br leaving with a proton, forming a conjugated diene. But that doesn't explain the IR peak. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of an exo-cyclic double bond, but again, not matching the IR.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the NMR spectrum. The product 1 has an NMR with peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a CH2 group. If it's a ketone, maybe adjacent to some CH
