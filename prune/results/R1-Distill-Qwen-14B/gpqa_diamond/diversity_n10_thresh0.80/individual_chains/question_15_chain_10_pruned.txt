Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So, the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Also, both orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radius, but the star with Planet_1 is more massive than the one with Planet_2. The researchers want to choose which planet to observe based on the higher probability of a transit.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orientation of the orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But how do other factors come in?

Wait, the transit probability formula... I think it's something like (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. Oh wait, the probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet from the star. More accurately, the probability P is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_star / m_planet)^{1/3} )) or something like that? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the transit probability is given by (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet * (1 / (1 + (M_star / m_planet)^{1/3} ))... Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the probability of the planet's orbit being edge-on is higher if the star is more massive? Or is it more about the orbital distance?

Wait, another approach. The probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. But more accurately, it's the probability that the planet's orbit, when viewed from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. This probability is given by (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / m_planet)^{1/3} ))... Wait, no, maybe that's part of the Doppler method's efficiency. Or perhaps I'm
