Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. I'll take it slow and think out loud.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think I should find the state |alpha> normalized. Because the problem says it's proportional to that expression, so we need to find the coefficients with the correct normalization.

The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's write this as a vector. Since |up> and |down> form a basis, the state can be represented as a vector [1+i, 2-i]^T. The normalization requires that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components equals 1.

So, compute the norm squared: |1+i|² + |2 - i|².

The modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b². So:

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. Thus, the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question says |alpha> is proportional to that vector. So after normalization, the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Next, the operator whose matrix is A_ij. Let me think about what this operator looks like. The matrix is 2x2 (since it's acting on spin-½ particles, I guess). The diagonal elements are zero because when i=j, A_ij is zero. The off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2.

So the matrix is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Wait, that's for a 2x2 matrix. So it's a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, but the Pauli X matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the operator A has eigenvalues (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), meaning the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So the possible outcomes when measuring this operator are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, with probabilities equal to the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenstates in |alpha>.

Wait, but wait. The eigenstates of the operator A are the same as those of the Pauli X matrix. Because the eigenstates are |+x> and |–x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator.

So first step: Express |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of operator A (i.e., the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the expectation value directly, but maybe not. Let me think.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |–x>, which are (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, yes. Because for spin-½ systems, the eigenstates of the X operator are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |–x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to find the probability of measuring +ħ/2, I need to find the projection of |alpha> onto |+x>, and square the absolute value.

Similarly for |–x>.

So let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |–x>.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the components of |alpha> in the X basis. Because the operator A is diagonal in the X basis.

So let me compute the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |–x>.

First, let's write down |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |–x>, which are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)
|–x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2)

So, let me express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |–x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |–x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |–x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * [ (|+x> + |–x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * [ (|+x> - |–x>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [ (1+i) (|+x> + |–x>) + (2 - i)(|+x> - |–x>) ) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2))

Let me compute the coefficients for |+x> and |–x>:

Coefficient of |+x>:
(1+i) + (2 - i) = 1 + i + 2 - i = 3.

Coefficient of |–x>:
(1+i) - (2 - i) = 1 +i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i.

So putting it back:

|alpha> = [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |–x> ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))

So the amplitude for |+x> is 3 / (sqrt(14)) and for |–x> is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability of measuring +ħ/2 is the square of the absolute value of the |+x> component.

Compute |3 / sqrt(14)|^2: (9)/(14) ≈ 0.642857... which is about 0.64. Hmm, and the other probability would be |(-1 +2i)|^2 /14.

Compute |(-1 + 2i)|²: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/14 ≈0.3571... which is approximately 0.36.

Wait, but the options don't seem to have 0.64 and 0.36. Let me check the options.

Option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. Let's see what the average value is.

The average value of A would be the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

So average <A> = ( (ħ/2) * (9/14) ) + ( (-ħ/2) * (5/14) )

= ( (9/14) - (5/14) ) * (ħ/2 )

= (4/14) * (ħ/2 ) = (2/7) * (ħ/2 ) )= ħ/(7).

So the average is ħ/7.

So looking back at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average ħ/7. That matches.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.35714, which rounds to 0.36. So that seems correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but another thought: I think I might have made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let me double-check the expansion.

Expressing |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |–x>:

I had:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |–x>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * [ (|+x> + |–x> )/sqrt(2) ) ] + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * [ (|+x> - |–x> )/sqrt(2) ) ]

= [ (1+i) (|+x> + |–x> ) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |–x> ) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))

Expanding numerator:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|–x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|–x>

Group terms:

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] |+x> + [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] |–x>

So (1 + i + 2 -i ) |+x> = (3) |+x>

(1 + i -2 +i ) |–x> = ( (1-2) ) + (i +i ) ) = (-1 + 2i)|–x>

Yes, that part is correct.

So the coefficients are 3 and (-1 + 2i), each divided by sqrt(14).

So the probabilities are |3|^2/14 = 9/14 ≈0.642857, and | (-1 +2i)|^2 /14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈0.35714.

Which are 0.64 and 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the average is (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) )= (9-5)/(14*2) ) * ħ = (4)/(28) ) * ħ = 1/7 * ħ.

So that's ħ/7, which matches option A.

Looking back at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64,0.36 and average ħ/7. So that's correct.

Wait but option D has 0.61, 0.29, and 2ħ/sqrt(7). Hmm, why might I have thought that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the expansion.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should compute the expectation value without going through the basis.

The operator A has matrix elements A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and diagonal elements zero. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, compute it as the sum of A_ij times <i| alpha> * <alpha |j>.

Because A is the operator with matrix elements A_ij, so <A> = sum_{i,j} A_ij <i|alpha> <alpha|j>.

Wait, but since A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], so only the terms where i≠j are non-zero.

So <A> = A_12 <up|alpha> <alpha|down> + A_21 <down|alpha> <alpha| up>

But since A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2,

= (ħ/2) [ <up|alpha> <alpha|down> + <down|alpha> <alpha|up> ]

Hmm, but that might be a bit complicated. Maybe better to compute it as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let me compute |alpha> as a vector. The coefficients are:

c_up = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
c_down = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

The operator A is:

A = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So when you compute A |alpha>, you get:

A |alpha> = [ (0)(c_up) + (ħ/2)(c_down) ] |up> + [ (ħ/2)(c_up) + (0)(c_down) ] |down>

So A |alpha> = (ħ/2) c_down |up> + (ħ/2) c_up |down>

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of alpha and A alpha.

So, alpha is [c_up, c_down]^T, and A alpha is [(ħ/2) c_down, (ħ/2) c_up]^T.

The inner product is (c_up^* ) * (ħ/2 c_down) + (c_down^* ) * (ħ/2 c_up )

= (ħ/2) [ c_up^* c_down + c_down^* c_up ]

Hmm, note that c_up^* c_down + c_down^* c_up is equal to 2 Re( c_up^* c_down )

So let's compute c_up^* c_down.

c_up = (1 +i)/sqrt(7), so c_up^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

c_down = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So c_up^* c_down = [ (1 -i)(2 -i) ] /7.

Multiply numerator:

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 - i -2i + i².

i² is -1, so:

2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

So c_up^* c_down = (1 -3i)/7.

Then, c_up^* c_down + c_down^* c_up is (1-3i)/7 + (1+3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So the inner product becomes (ħ/2) * 2/7 = ħ/7.

Which matches what I got earlier. So average is ħ/7.

So this approach also gives the same result.

Now, the probabilities again were 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36). So the correct option is A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator with matrix representation A_ij, where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of the operator must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the norm squared:
\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5.
\]
The total norm squared is \(2 + 5 = 7\), so the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Express |α⟩ in the eigenbasis of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Express |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]
Substitute |up⟩ and |down⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:
\[
|up⟩ = \frac{|+x⟩ + |-x⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |down⟩ = \frac{|+x⟩ - |-x⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Substituting these into |α⟩:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{|+x⟩ + |-x⟩}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{|+x⟩ - |-x⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right)|+x⟩ + \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right)|-x⟩ \right].
\]
Compute the coefficients:
\[
(1+i) + (2-i) = 3, \quad (1+i) - (2-i) = -1 + 2i.
\]
Thus:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}|+x⟩ + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}|-x⟩.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are the squared magnitudes of their coefficients:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{1^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the average value of A
The eigenvalues of A are \(+\frac{\hbar}{2}\) and \(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\). The average value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
