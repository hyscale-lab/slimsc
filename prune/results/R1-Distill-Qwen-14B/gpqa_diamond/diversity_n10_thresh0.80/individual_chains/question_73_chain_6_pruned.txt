Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just add them like in classical mechanics because of the relativistic effects. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in relativity is different.

So the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, wait, when you have two objects moving in the same direction, how do you find the relative speed? I think the formula for relative velocity when moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, no, that's when they're moving towards each other. Oh wait, no, I might be mixing it up. Let me think again.

The correct formula for the relative velocity u' when object A is moving at velocity u and object B at velocity v in the same frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference divided by that factor.

So astronaut 1 has mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Astronaut 2 has mass 3m, speed 0.5c. So for astronaut 1 moving in the same direction as astronaut 2, the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So relative speed is 0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²
