Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, minimum energy... I'm thinking that in systems of charges, the potential energy depends on their arrangement. Since all the charges are the same, if they repel each other, the potential energy would be higher. But if they're fixed, maybe the problem is about the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, and among the others themselves.

Wait, so 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed, so the other 12 are each 2 meters away from it. The system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 and the fixed charge, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait a minute. The 12 charges are all at the same point, 2 meters from P. So the distance between any two of them would be zero? No, that can't be right because they're all at 2 meters from P, but which direction? Oh, wait, if all 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, it's possible they form a spherical shell around P. So each is 2 meters away from P, but their positions relative to each other could be on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters.

So the distance between any two of them would vary, but the minimum potential energy would occur when the system is in the most stable configuration, which for point charges would probably be when they're placed as far apart as possible. But wait, in this case, the charges are all fixed at 2 meters from P, but their arrangement isn't given. Wait, no, the problem says 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps they're all at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other could vary. But the problem is about the potential
