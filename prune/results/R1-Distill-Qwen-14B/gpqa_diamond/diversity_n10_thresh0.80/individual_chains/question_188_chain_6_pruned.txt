Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but I think rhombohedral means all the edges are the same length, and all the angles are equal. Oh wait, but in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. So, it's a rhombohedral unit cell with interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember there's a formula for interplanar distances in crystals. Oh right, it's using the Miller indices. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ), but wait, I might be mixing something up here. Alternatively, sometimes it's written using the reciprocal of the vector components.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice. The formula I remember is derived from the unit cell vectors. The interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

d_hkl = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) * (1/a²) * cos²θ ... no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Oh right, the correct formula for a general crystal system (not necessarily cubic) is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ_12 + hl cos γ_13 + kl cos γ_23) ) )

Wait, but wait, the angles in the unit cell are given as α, β, γ. In a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So, the formula should have each of the cos terms involving these angles.

Wait, let's clarify. The interplanar distance formula for a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but for non-cubic, it's more complicated. The general formula for any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l² + k²/m² + l²/n²) + ... ) No, that's the reciprocal space. Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the reciprocal of the sum of squared
