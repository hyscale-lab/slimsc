Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and needs to absorb a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. Wait, what's the fundamental state again? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state.

So the molecule can be modeled as a non-rigid rotor, which I think means it's a rotating system with some vibration considered. Wait, no, the rotation-vibration model probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So I need to find the photon's momentum that causes this transition.

The given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (ω) = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, but if it's the non-rigid rotor, perhaps the model accounts for both rotation and vibration. Oh, maybe the energy levels are quantized for both. But for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are usually considered separately, but sometimes they're treated together in a combined model.

In the case of a photon absorption, the molecule would transition between energy states. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between two states. But wait, the question is about momentum, not energy. Oh, but the photon's momentum is related to its energy. Since E = hf = pc, so p = E/c. So if I can find the energy difference between the states, I can find the photon's momentum.

Wait, but what's the energy difference? The molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state would have the next higher energy. But wait, does the molecule move to the next vibrational state or the next rotational state? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotation and vibration. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But the problem says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, which suggests the smallest possible energy increase. So which transition requires less energy: vibration or rotation?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels have a spacing of (1/2) hω. For rotational levels, the spacing depends on the moment of inertia and the rotational quantum number.

Let me calculate both possible energy differences to see which is smaller.

First, the vibrational energy change. The energy for vibration is given by E_v = (v + 1/2) hω. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 would be a photon of energy hω. The momentum would then be p_photon = E_photon / c = (hω)/c.

Wait, but what about rotational energy? The rotational energy levels for a diatomic molecule are E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I
