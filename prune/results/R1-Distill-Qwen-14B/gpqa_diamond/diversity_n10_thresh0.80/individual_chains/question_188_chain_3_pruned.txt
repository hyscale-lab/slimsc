Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but let me try to work through it.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, first, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system has all edges equal (a=b=c) and all angles equal (α=β=γ). So it's a special case where the unit cell is a rhombohedron. That makes things a bit symmetric, which might help.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, especially a primitive one, how are the atoms arranged? I think in a simple rhombohedral structure, each corner has an atom. So the interatomic distance would be the distance between two adjacent corner atoms.

But wait, the interatomic distance (d inter) is the distance between two adjacent atoms in the lattice. For a simple cubic structure, this would be 'a' the lattice parameter, but in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners, so the distance between two adjacent atoms is along the edge, so that should be 'a', right? So in this case, the interatomic distance is 'a' which is 10 Angstroms. So a=10 Angstroms.

Now, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal. The formula for interplanar distance (d_{hkl}) in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² ). But wait, wait, but in a cubic system, this formula works because all angles are 90 degrees. But here, the crystal is rhombohedral, so the angles are 30 degrees each. So the formula changes.

I recall that for a general cubic system (with angles not necessarily 90 degrees), the interplanar distance is given by a different formula. Oh right, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α)
