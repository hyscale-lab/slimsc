Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation because it's about the distribution of atoms in different energy levels in a star's photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). 

The Boltzmann equation is: (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in levels 1 and 2.
- g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of levels 2 and 1.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. But maybe the exact wavelength isn't directly needed unless it's for calculating energy difference, but I think in this context the energy difference is given implicitly through the wavelength via the relation E = hc/λ. But perhaps we can proceed without exact calculation since the temperatures are given.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio is dependent on the temperature. So when the star has no spots, the temperature is higher (6000 K), and when 40% is spotted, the effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, how does the presence of spots affect the overall temperature? Oh, because the spots are cooler regions, so the average or effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. But in this problem, when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K, so that's the T we should use in the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 decreases. So n1/n2 goes down when there are spots. Since the temperature is lower, how does that affect the ratio?

Let me think. The Boltzmann factor is exponential of (-ΔE/(kT)). If T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative (since T is in the denominator). So the exponential term becomes smaller, meaning that the ratio n1/n2 becomes smaller. Because n1 is the lower level and n2 is the higher (since E2 > E1). So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases because the Boltzmann factor is smaller, so fewer atoms are in the higher energy state relative to the lower one. Wait, no. Let's see: the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So if T decreases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative. So the exponential term is smaller. So (n1/n2) is smaller. So when the star has spots, T is lower, and so the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. That's exactly what the problem says, so that makes sense.

So the question is, what's the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_has_spots.

Let me denote R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1
