Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions, right?

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form the corresponding acid.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with CN- (from NaCN), it's typically a nucleophilic addition. But wait, for such reactions, the conditions are important. Oh right, when a ketone adds a cyanide, it usually forms a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed under specific conditions. I think that the reaction between a ketone and CN- requires an acid catalyst. So, the reagent A in the first reaction should be an acid, like H3O+ (which is what you get when H2SO4 is used as a catalyst and then worked up with water, but in this case, the option might just give H3O+ as A).

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is used in other kinds of reactionsâ€”like maybe the reduction of a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure. Oh, wait, I think when you have a ketone reacting with CN- and H3O+, it's an acid-catalyzed addition. So that would make sense. So A is H3O+ for the first reaction.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and H3O+ to form the cyanohydrin. That makes sense because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, and water leaves, forming the cyanohydrin.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B in H2O to become the corresponding acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids, but what reagents are typically used?

Oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually involves strong oxidizing agents. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions, like with H2SO4. Alternatively, other oxidizing agents like (CrO3 in H2SO4) can do this. Wait, but in the options, the reagents listed are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the second reaction, reagent B is used in H2O. So maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction? Oh, wait, nitriles can undergo hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. If it's hydrolysis, nitriles can convert into amides or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions.

Wait, under acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carbox
