Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think this through.

Parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. I remember that the parallax (p) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. So, a star that's closer has a larger parallax, and a farther star has a smaller parallax. The formula is p = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs, right?

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. I think this is asking about the density of stars in a given range of parallax values. So how does the number of stars change as parallax changes?

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. Does that mean uniform in space or uniform in the sky (like on the celestial sphere)? Oh, the question says uniformly distributed in the sky. So I guess they're spread out evenly over the celestial sphere, but their distances would vary.

Parallax is related to distance. So for a star at distance d, its parallax p is 1/d. So if I consider a small range of parallax, say from p to p + dp, I need to find how many stars fall into that range.

Let me think about the volume involved. The number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region. Since the distribution is uniform in the sky, stars are uniformly spread out in space, but I think here it's more about their apparent distribution on the sky, not their actual spatial distribution. Wait, no, wait. Uniform distribution in the sky might mean that their positions on the celestial sphere are uniform, but their distances can vary.

Wait, perhaps it's a question about the distribution in terms of distance. Let me think: if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density would be uniform. But the question says they're uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, that's a bit different. Wait, maybe it's an angular distribution? So, in terms of solid angle, they're uniformly spread. But how does that relate to distance?

Wait, maybe I should approach this from the perspective of how parallax relates to distance and the number of stars you observe.

If I consider the number of stars with a parallax between p and p + dp, what's the corresponding distance range?

Since p = 1/d, the distance d = 1/p. So, when p increases (parallax), the distance d decreases (they're closer
