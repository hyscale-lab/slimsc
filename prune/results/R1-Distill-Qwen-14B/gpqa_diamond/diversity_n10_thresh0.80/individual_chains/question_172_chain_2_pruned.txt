Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? And the question says something about iron atoms being twice as excited in a specific energy level in star_1 compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation here refers to the energy level of the iron atoms. 

The energy difference between those levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. And the question is about the effective temperatures of the stars, T1 and T2, assuming LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles (like electrons or atoms) follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. 

So, the key here is probably the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), right? Since E2 is higher than E1, so (E2-E1) is positive. So if the higher energy state is more populated, that would imply a higher temperature because the exponent would be less negative, making the ratio larger.

In the question, it's stated that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, does that mean that the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2? Or does it mean the excitation energy is twice as high? I think it means the population in that specific energy level is higher. So for a given transition, the ratio of the populations is given.

So, for each star, the ratio of the populations of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) would follow the Boltzmann equation. Let's say the excited state is state 2 and the ground state is state 1. So for star_1, the ratio (n2/n1)_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio (n2/n1)_2. Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So perhaps the number of atoms in an excited state (n2) is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Wait, no, I think the problem says that the excitation is twice
