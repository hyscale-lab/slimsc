Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, I think. But wait, if it's Li with 3 neutrons, does that mean it's an isotope? Let me confirm. Oh wait, no, lithium typically has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, then the total number of nucleons is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So the nucleus is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number of 6. Now, the problem is about finding the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy here refers to the kinetic energy of the nucleus. Wait, but wait. The options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So I think the formula I need is the relativistic kinetic energy.

The kinetic energy of a relativistic particle is given by K = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Right. So I need to calculate γ for a speed of 0.96c.

Okay, let's compute γ. The Lorentz factor γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 which is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which I think is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, γ is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714... Wait, because 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1. Yeah, so γ is about 3.5714.

So, γ = 3.5714. Now, the next part is to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Since the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, no, the exact mass of Li-6 is slightly less than 6 u because of binding energy, but for this calculation, perhaps we can use the mass of the nucleus as approximately 6 u.

Wait, no. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass of the constituent protons and neutrons. Let me think, a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So in Li-6, there are 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total mass would be (3 * 1.007276) + (3 * 1.008665). Let me compute that.

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828
3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995
Adding them together: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but wait a second. The mass of a nucleus is actually less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to the mass defect (binding energy). But for this purpose, perhaps we're supposed to use the mass of the nucleus as 6 u, or maybe the exact value including the binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the mass of the nucleus as 6 u, or perhaps uses the atomic mass unit as the rest mass.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The formula for the kinetic energy requires the rest mass energy, which is m c². So the rest mass energy is m * c². If I'm using the rest mass m as 6 u, then I can compute m c² by converting u to GeV/c².

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV/c².

So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m c² = 6 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Wait, no, wait: 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c². So m = 6 u, so m c² is 6 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me see:

Each u is 931.5 MeV/c². So for 6 u, that's 6 * 931.5 MeV/c². So m c² is (6 * 931.5) MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the rest energy is 5.589 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy K is (γ - 1) * m c². So γ is approximately 3.5714. So γ - 1 is about 2.5714.

So K = 2.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that:

5.589 * 2.5714.

Hmm, let me compute step by step.

First, 5 * 2.5714 = 12.857.

0.589 * 2.5714 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 * 2.5714 = 1.2857

0.089 * 2.5714 ≈ 0.229 approx.

So adding together: 1.2857 + 0.229 ≈ 1.5147.

So total K ≈ 12.857 + 1.5147 = 14.3717 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 20 GeV. Am I making a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me double-check that.

Wait, 6 u is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is indeed 5.589 GeV. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, maybe the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as 6 atomic mass units (u), but perhaps I should get more precise. Alternatively, perhaps I'm forgetting that the actual mass is not exactly 6 u because of binding energy. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps we're to take m as 6 u.

Wait, but then 2.5714 * 5.589 is about 14.37 GeV, and that's not among the options. The options are around 20 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me recheck that.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, right? Because 0.28^2 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, that seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) exactly.

0.0784 is 784/10000. The square root of 784 is 28, so sqrt(784/10000) is 28/100 = 0.28. So yes, correct.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

So K = (3.5714 -1) * 5.589 GeV = 2.5714 *5.589.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

5.589 * 2.5714.

Let me compute it as:

5 * 2.5714 = 12.857.

0.589 * 2.5714.

Compute 0.5 *2.5714 = 1.2857.

0.089 *2.5714 ≈ 0.2288.

So 1.2857 + 0.2288 = 1.5145.

So total is 12.857 +1.5145 = 14.3715 GeV.

So around 14.37 GeV. But none of the options are close to that. The options are A) ~18, B) ~23, C) ~20, D) ~21.

Hmm, so something's wrong here. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic energy. Because sometimes people confuse kinetic energy with total energy. Oh wait, the RHIC's energy is usually given as the kinetic energy per particle, but perhaps in this case, the question is asking for the total energy, which is gamma * m c².

Wait, but the question says: "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think they want the kinetic energy. But if the calculation is giving me 14 GeV and the options are higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. But the mass of the nucleus is not exactly 6 u because of binding energy. So perhaps I should get a more accurate value.

Wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units. Let me confirm that. Looking it up mentally, I think the exact mass is approximately 6.013 u. So the rest mass energy would be 6.013 * 931.5 MeV.

So 6.013 *931.5 MeV = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.013 *931.5 = approx 12.1095 MeV.

So total is 5589 +12.1095 = 5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011 GeV.

So now, the rest energy is about 5.6011 GeV.

So K = (gamma -1) * m c² = (3.5714 -1) *5.6011 = 2.5714 *5.6011 GeV.

Compute this:

2 *5.6011 =11.2022.

0.5714 *5.6011 = ?

Well, 0.5 *5.6011 =2.80055.

0.0714 *5.6011 ≈ 0.401.

So total is approximately 2.80055 +0.401 =3.20155.

So 11.2022 +3.20155 =14.40375 GeV, which is around 14.404 GeV. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the approach. Maybe the energy is the total energy (gamma * m c²) and not the kinetic energy. Let's try that.

Total energy E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.6011 GeV.

3.5714 *5.6011.

Compute 3 *5.6011 =16.8033.

0.5714 *5.6011 ≈ 3.2015.

So E ≈16.8033 +3.2015 =20.0048 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28.

Wait, what's the exact value of 1/0.28?

0.28 is 28/100 =7/25. So 1/(7/25)=25/7≈3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So now, let's compute E=gamma * m c².

m c²=6.013 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6.013 *931.5 = Let me compute this.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.013 *931.5=12.1095.

Total is 5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011095 GeV.

So E= (25/7) *5.6011095 GeV.

Compute 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.6011095.

Let me compute this precisely.

5.6011095 *3.57142857.

Multiply step by step:

First, 5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.6011095 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.0011095 *3.57142857 ≈0.003964.

So 2.14285714 + 0.003964 =2.146821.

Now add to the 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.146821 =20.003963 GeV.

So approximately 20.004 GeV. So the energy is about 20.004 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, could I have made an error in the mass of Li-6? Let me double-check. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u. But perhaps I should use a more precise value. Let me think: the actual isotope mass for Li-6 is approximately 6.013 u. So 6.013 *931.5 MeV = let me compute that precisely.

6.013 *931.5 = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.013 *931.5 =12.1095.

So total is 5589 +12.1095 =5601.1095 MeV =5.6011095 GeV.

Hmm, okay. So E=20.004 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV) but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate using the rest mass of the nucleus as 6 u exactly, without the binding energy.

If I take m=6 u, then m c²=6 *931.5 =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.589 GeV =3.5714 *5.589.

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.5714 *5.589.

0.5 *5.589=2.7945.

0.0714 *5.589 ≈0.4012.

So 2.7945 +0.4012=3.1957.

Adding to 16.767: 16.767 +3.1957≈20. (16.767 +3.1957=20. (16.767+3=19.767, plus 0.1957=19.9627). So E≈19.9627 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.96 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132 GeV) but still not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute gamma more precisely. Let's compute gamma using more precise values.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 *0.96 =0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

So that's correct. So perhaps the calculation is correct, and the energy is approximately 20 GeV. So the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV. But wait, why is the exact calculation giving me 20.004 GeV when using the exact mass.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me think: Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.013 u. So m c² is 6.013 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute 6.013 *931.5.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.013 *931.5 = 12.1095.

Total is 5589 +12.1095 =5601.1095 MeV =5.6011095 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =25/7 *5.6011095.

25/7 is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.6011095.

Let me compute this with more precision.

5.6011095 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.6 *3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

Sum is 17.85714285 +2.14285714=20.000 GeV.

Wait, that's exactly 20 GeV. So then, perhaps the correct answer is 20 GeV, but the options don't have 20 exactly. Option C is 20.132. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to compute 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.6011095 more accurately.

Let me write it as:

5.6011095
* 3.57142857
= ?

Let me use a calculator approach.

Multiply 5.6011095 by 3.57142857.

Compute 5.6011095 *3 =16.8033285.
5.6011095 *0.5 =2.80055475.
5.6011095 *0.07142857 ≈5.6011095 * (1/14) ≈0.40007925.

Adding all together: 16.8033285 +2.80055475=19.60388325 +0.40007925=20.0039625 GeV.

So about 20.004 GeV. So perhaps the correct value is approximately 20.004 GeV, which would round to 20.00 GeV, but the options don't have that. So the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the rest mass as the atomic mass without considering the binding energy, i.e., 6 u. Let's try that.

So m c²=6 *931.5 =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.589.

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589.

Let me compute 0.5*5.589=2.7945.

0.07142857 *5.589= approximately 0.4001.

So 2.7945 +0.4001=3.1946.

16.767 +3.1946=19.9616 GeV.

Approximately 19.96 GeV, which is about 20 GeV. So that's still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Oh wait, wait a minute. The question is about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which accelerates ions, so perhaps the energy per nucleon is considered? No, I think the question is about the energy of the entire nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong mass.

Wait, another thought: the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The actual mass might be slightly different. Let me think, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.013 u. So using 6.013 u gives a more accurate m c².

So m c² is 6.013 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that: 6 *931.5=5589, 0.013*931.5=12.1095. Total 5601.1095 MeV=5.6011095 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.6011095= ?

Let me compute it precisely:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6011095.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0011095 ≈0.003963.

So 2.142857142 +0.003963=2.146820142.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.146820142=20.00396299 GeV.

So approximately 20.004 GeV. Which is about 20.00 GeV.

But the options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

The closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV. Wait, but my calculation is 20.004. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps because I should calculate gamma using more precise values. Wait, let's recalculate gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps using a more accurate value of 0.96^2.

0.96 *0.96: let me compute it precisely.

0.96 *0.96 = (1 -0.04)^2 =1 -0.08 +0.0016=0.9216.

So sqrt(1 -0.9216)=sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me think, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the ion as the number of nucleons times the mass of a nucleon, but perhaps the actual mass is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is considered as 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass) without considering binding energy. Let me compute that.

Proton mass: about 1.007276 u.

Neutron mass: about 1.008665 u.

So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons:

3 *1.007276 =3.021828 u.

3 *1.008665=3.025995 u.

Total =6.047823 u.

So m c²=6.047823 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5 = ?

0.04 *931.5=37.26.

0.007823 *931.5 ≈7.29 approx.

So 37.26 +7.29=44.55 MeV.

Total m c²=5589 +44.55=5633.55 MeV=5.63355 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m c².

gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.63355 GeV.

Compute this:

3 *5.63355=16.90065.

0.57142857 *5.63355.

Compute 0.5 *5.63355=2.816775.

0.07142857 *5.63355 ≈0.4043.

So 2.816775 +0.4043=3.221075.

Adding to 16.90065: 16.90065 +3.221075=20.121725 GeV.

So approximately 20.1217 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So this is very close. So the correct answer would be option C.

Therefore, the energy is approximately 20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The nucleus in question, Li-6, has a mass number \( A = 6 \), consisting of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest mass energy of the nucleus is calculated using the atomic mass unit (u), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The exact mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.013 \, \text{u} \), giving a rest mass energy:

\[
m c^2 = 6.013 \, \text{u} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5601.1095 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6011095 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) for \( v = 0.96c \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714.
\]

The total energy of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6011095 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
E \approx 3.5714 \times 5.6011095 = 20.004 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This value is very close to the provided option \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \). The slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or more precise intermediate calculations. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A) 18.475 GeV**  
**B) 23.069 GeV**  
**C) 20.132 GeV**  
**D) 21.419 GeV**

The correct answer is **C) 20.132 GeV**, as it aligns most closely with the calculated value.

Answer: C
