Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, I remember neutrinos are produced in various processes in the Sun, right? The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago. And we're supposed to find the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). 

Wait, the pp-III branch... I think the proton-proton chain has multiple branches. Oh right, the main pp-I branch is the most significant, producing the bulk of the Sun's energy. But there's also the pp-II and pp-III branches. PP-III involves heavier elements, maybe like carbon or nitrogen? Or wait, I think the pp-III branch is the part where the CNO cycle comes into play. Or was it the other way around? No, the CNO cycle is a separate process. Maybe the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton chain, perhaps involving boron or something else. 

Wait, actually, I think the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton chain. The main process, pp-I, goes from two protons fusing into deuterium, then capturing another proton to form helium-3, and then two helium-3s fusing into helium-4. But if the conditions are right, some of the helium-3 might instead undergo a different reaction, like capturing an electron and a neutron (but wait, that doesn't make sense. Neutron? No, wait, maybe capturing a photon or something else). Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is when a helium-3 captures two protons to form carbon-5, which then decays, but that's the CNO cycle perhaps. 

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is the part where a helium-3 and a helium-3 fuse, but in a different way than the main branch. Or maybe it's the part where a helium-3 captures a neutron? No, neutrons are rare in the sun. Alternatively, maybe it's the part where a helium-3 and a helium-4 fuse, but that doesn't fit either. I'm a bit fuzzy on this detail.

But regardless, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly
