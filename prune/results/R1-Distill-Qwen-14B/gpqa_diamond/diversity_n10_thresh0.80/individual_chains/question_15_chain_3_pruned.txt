Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass. But the stars they're orbiting are different. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. Oh, right, more massive stars usually have larger radii, but in this case, they're the same. So the host stars are similar in size despite the mass difference.

The transit probability formula I think is something like (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some factor related to the orbital distance. Or wait, maybe it's more about the orbital distance and the star's size. I think the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. The probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (something), where a is the semi-major axis or orbital period plays into that.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that simplifies. So it becomes (R_p / R_s)^2 times something else. Or wait, no, the probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the distance from the star to the observer, but
