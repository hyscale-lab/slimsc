Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the abundance of elements in different energy states can be explained using the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The number of atoms in an excited state is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which depends on the temperature and the energy difference between levels.

The energy difference given is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh, because 1.38e-23 J is the same as k (Boltzmann constant) times a temperature of 1 K. Because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So, the energy difference ΔE is k*T, where T is 1 K. So ΔE = k * T_0, where T_0 is 1 K.

Wait, but in the problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, ΔE = k*T_0, which implies T_0 is 1 K here. Hmm, but maybe that's a red herring because the equation is probably more about the ratio of the populations.

So the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) to the ground state (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann equation: n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where g's are the statistical weights. If the question says that star_1 has twice as excited atoms as star_2, perhaps we're considering the same transition for both stars, so g_upper and g_lower are the same for both. So the ratio for each star would be 2 and 1 respectively, or maybe the ratio of (n_upper/n_lower) for star1 is twice that of star2.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So for star_1, n_upper is twice as much as for star_2. Or wait, perhaps the ratio is (n_upper)_1 / (n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper
