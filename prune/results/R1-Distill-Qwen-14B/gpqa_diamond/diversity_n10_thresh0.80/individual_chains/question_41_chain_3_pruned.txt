Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. They ask what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. Oh, and c is given as 1, so the speed of light in a vacuum is just 1.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in a medium depending on the medium's velocity. But wait, isn't the speed of light in a medium always less than c? So when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed of the light?

Let me think. The medium is glass with index n. So normally, the speed of light inside the glass is v_glass = c/n, which is 1/n because c is 1 here. But now the glass is moving. So how does the movement of the glass affect the speed of the light as observed in the lab?

Wait, I'm trying to remember if it's like the Doppler effect or something related to relativity. Because if the glass is moving, the light's speed would be measured differently in the lab frame.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about this using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to consider relativity. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v, but what's the speed of light in the glass? Normally it's 1/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that combine?

Wait no, the speed of light in the glass is determined by the medium's properties, not the medium's motion. Or is it? Because velocity is relative; in different frames, velocities add differently.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in the rest frame of the glass. In that frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n (since c is 1, it's 1/n). Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u * v)/cÂ²). But wait, in this case, the light's speed in the glass frame is u, and the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So the lab would see the light moving at u' = (u + v
