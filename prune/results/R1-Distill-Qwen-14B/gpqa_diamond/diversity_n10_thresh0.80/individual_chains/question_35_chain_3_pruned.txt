Okay, so I've got this question about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a specific 2x2 matrix.

So first, let me write down what S looks like. The first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S matrix is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Wait, because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh wait, S looks like the Pauli Y matrix. Oh right, the Pauli matrices, sigma y is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Yes, so S is sigma y, which is the Pauli Y matrix. So, the operator Ay is c times sigma y. So Ay = c·σy.

Now, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are known. The eigenvalues of σy are ±i (because Pauli matrices are Hermitian? Wait no, wait. Wait, Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. Wait, but sigma y is Hermitian, right? Let me check. 

The sigma y matrix is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait, taking the complex conjugate transpose (Hermitian conjugate) of sigma y would be:

[0  i ]
[-i 0 ]

Which is not the same as sigma y. So I think I made a mistake. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, sigma y is actually Hermitian? Because the Hermitian condition is that the matrix equals its conjugate transpose. So for sigma y, each element's complex conjugate is in the mirrored position. Let me compute the conjugate transpose.

Conjugate of 0 is 0. Conjugate of -i is i. So the top row becomes [0, i], and the second row becomes [-i, 0]. Comparing to sigma y, which is [0, -i], [i, 0], the transpose is [0, i; -i, 0
