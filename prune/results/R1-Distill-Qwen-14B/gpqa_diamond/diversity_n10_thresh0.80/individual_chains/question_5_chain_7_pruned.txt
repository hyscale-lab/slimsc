Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors and eigenvalues are a bit tricky for me. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction, but the given components are for P_x, P_y, and P_z. Oh right, because any direction can be expressed in terms of these components.

Wait, no, maybe the operator here is given in terms of its components, and we need to combine them into a single operator along a direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, because the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, so the vector n would have components in x and z, but not y. So, the operator we're looking at is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since the y-component of n is zero.

So, let's think. The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis, I think. Or maybe it's the other way around, like polar coordinates where θ is the angle from the x-axis. Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the spin-1/2 systems are usually considered with the z-axis as the standard. So probably, n would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so φ must be 0 or π. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Or wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the x-axis to the projection in the x-z plane. So maybe it's better to represent n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is between 0 and π/2. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the parametrization. Maybe it doesn't matter for the eigenvector calculation since it's arbitrary.

But wait, the operator P is along n, so it's P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But wait, no, the operator for spin in
