Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and a reagent B along with water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible A and B reagents, and I need to choose the correct pair.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. When ketones react with cyanide, I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is that the ketone's carbonyl group activates the carbon for attack. So, NaCN would supply the CN- ion as the nucleophile.

Wait, but the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Oh right, so this might be a cyanohydrin formation. Cyanohydrin is when a hydroxyl and nitrile group are added to the carbonyl carbon. That requires an acid catalyst, right? Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+ (sulfuric acid maybe). So looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Oh, wait, that's another possibility. What's the role of NaHSO3 in such reactions?

Wait, no, for cyanohydrin formation, the common reagent is HCN and an acid. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses an acid catalyst. So in the first reaction, A is H3O+ or another acid. Let me think: when you add HCN to a ketone in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms the cyanohydrin. So in the first step, butan-2-one plus NaCN and an acid (like H3O+) would form the cyanohydrin. So A is H3O+; that would point towards options A or B.

Wait, but wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. H3O+ would help in protonating the carbonyl. So reagent A is acid, so either option A or B or D. Wait, looking at the options, in option C, A is NaHSO3. I'm not sure about that.

Wait, what's the other possibility? Could the first reaction be a substitution or something else? No, butan-2-one isn't a good electrophile for substitution. It's a ketone, so it's more likely to undergo addition reactions.

So for the first reaction, A is an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

Oxidizing nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong oxidizing agents. Common ones are KMnO4 or CrO3 under acidic conditions. Alternatively, under basic conditions, maybe. But in the presence of water, what reagents would cause that oxidation?

Wait, but in this reaction, B is used along with H2O. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to amides or carboxylic acids. But under basic conditions, they can form amines or ammonium salts. But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be under acidic conditions.

Wait, but the starting material is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So maybe it's a two-step process: first, hydrolysis of the nitrile to an amide, then further oxidation? Or perhaps it's an oxidation of the nitrile group directly to the acid.

Wait, no. Alternatively, nitrile hydrolysis can be done in acidic or basic conditions. For example, using H2SO4 (which is H3O+), heating, and water. The reaction would convert the nitrile into a carboxylic acid. But wait, in the presence of a strong acid, like H2SO4, the nitrile would hydrolyze, but also, considering the structure, maybe it's more about oxidation.

Wait, but another possibility: the nitrile is first converted to an imine or something else, but that's probably not relevant here.

Hmm, let's think. The reagent B is added along with H2O. So what reagents are used for hydrolyzing nitriles to carboxylic acids?

I recall that H2O with HCl and H2O can cause hydrolysis. Wait, but that's in the presence of heat. Alternatively, using H2SO4 as the acid catalyst.

So, if B is HCl, then in the second reaction, the nitrile would undergo hydrolysis in acidic conditions (HCl and H2O) to form the carboxylic acid. So that would mean B is HCl.

Alternatively, if B is acetic acid (CH3COOH), would that work for hydrolysis? I'm not sure. I think that the typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids uses either strong acids like H2SO4 or perhaps using a base like NaOH, but under strongly acidic conditions, especially with heat.

In the options, for the second reaction, possible B reagents are HCl (in options A and C), CH3COOH (options B and D).

So in the first reaction, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Let me think again about the first reaction.

Wait, butan-2-one is treated with NaCN and A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the carbonyl group is converted into two groups: OH and CN. That's definitely a cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. So, H3O+ (option A and B) would be the catalyst. NaHSO3 is another acid, but I'm not sure about its role here. Because NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite; it's a weaker acid than H3O+ but can act as a source of H+.

Wait, but another possibility is that NaHSO3 is used as a catalyst in the first reaction. Or perhaps it's for a different purpose.

Wait, but if A is NaHSO3, then the solution would be acidic because HSO4^- is a weak base but can act as an acid. So perhaps it can protonate the carbonyl.

Wait, but in any case, the first reaction needs an acid catalyst.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So, if I'm correct that the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, then options A or B are possible.

In the second reaction, B should be HCl as that's a strong acid, which would facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

So, looking at the options, if B is HCl, then the correct option would be A or C. But wait, A is H3O+ and B is HCl. So option A would have A as H3O+ and B as HCl. That would make sense.

Wait, but the second reaction uses B and H2O. So, if B is HCl, then in the presence of water, it's an acidic condition, which would help the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, which is a mild acid, would that work? I think for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, a strong acid is needed, like HCl. So B should be HCl.

So, the correct reagents would be A = H3O+ and B = HCl. That's option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another possibility is that in the second reaction, the nitrile is being oxidized, not hydrolyzed. Because in the product, the nitrile is converted into a carboxylic acid. Could it be an oxidation reaction?

Wait, let's think about oxidation. Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under strong oxidizing conditions, like using KMnO4 or CrO3 in acidic conditions, with heat. So, in this case, if B is HCl, perhaps it's providing a strong acidic condition, and the oxidation is happening.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is converting to -COOH. So, that's an oxidation.

So, the reagent B must be a strong oxidizing agent. But HCl is not an oxidizing agent. So perhaps this is an oxidation reaction. Wait, but which reagent is B?

Wait, maybe the nitrile is oxidized using a strong acid and an oxidizing agent. For example, KMnO4 in acidic conditions.

But in the options, B is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me reconsider.

In the second reaction, the nitrile group is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. The reaction conditions are B and H2O. So, possible scenarios:

1. Oxidative hydrolysis: using an oxidizing agent in acidic or basic conditions.

2. Hydrolysis under acidic conditions to form the amide, which is then oxidized to the acid.

Wait, but without knowing the exact conditions, perhaps the reagent B is an acid catalyst for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid. Or maybe it's an oxidizing agent.

Wait, another angle: the first reaction requires an acid catalyst, which I think is H3O+ (so A is H3O+). Then, the second reaction uses HCl as the reagent (B is HCl). So that would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is undergoing hydrolysis in acidic conditions. So, HCl as the acid.

But another thought: the nitrile group is adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So perhaps it's a nitrile that's part of a larger structure. So, when B is added with H2O, perhaps the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid via oxidation.

Wait, but without an oxidizing agent, how does that happen? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a ketone, but that's not the case here. The product is a carboxylic acid, so oxidation is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent B is HCl, and under certain conditions, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to the acid. But I'm not sure if HCl alone can do that without a separate oxidizing agent.

Wait, another possibility is that the reagent B is a strong acid, like HCl, and in the presence of water and possibly heat, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. Let me think about the reactions.

Cyanohydrin formation: (CH3)2CO + HCN in presence of acid → (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

The first reaction is correct with H3O+ as A.

Second reaction: nitrile to acid.

If the nitrile is treated with HCl and H2O, perhaps under heat, the nitrile would hydrolyze. Maybe via the following steps: nitrile → amide (under HCl and H2O) → further hydrolysis to acid.

Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions typically gives a carboxylic acid.

So, if B is HCl, then in the second reaction, the nitrile would hydrolyze in the presence of H2O and HCl to form the carboxylic acid.

So, that makes sense. So, A is H3O+ and B is HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought B could be HCl, which would be option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. So that's a possibility.

But another thought: in the second reaction, if the reagent is CH3COOH (acetic acid), would that suffice? I'm not sure. I think nitrile hydrolysis to acid usually requires a strong acid, like H2SO4, or HCl.

So, I'd say that reagent B is HCl, making option A correct.

Wait, but let me think about the first reaction again. If A is NaHSO3, would that work?

Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) is a source of HSO4^- which can act as an acid. Maybe in the first reaction, it's providing the H+ needed. So, perhaps that's possible. But I'm not as sure.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+. So, in the first reaction, would it be sufficient to protonate the carbonyl oxygen? I think H3O+ is a stronger acid, so it's more likely to be the catalyst.

Thus, the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, and the second uses HCl as B. So, option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let's make sure.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Yes, that's the pair I was thinking.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this purpose, as it effectively facilitates the reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a nitrile-to-carboxylic-acid transformation, which typically occurs under acidic hydrolysis conditions. HCl, being a strong acid, provides the necessary acidic environment for this hydrolysis to proceed efficiently. CH₃COOH (acetic acid), being a weaker acid, is less effective for this transformation.

Considering the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This pair is consistent with the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B is not suitable for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid and less effective than H₃O⁺ for the first reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are less suitable than their alternatives in Option A.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
