Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the actual difference, the lines would overlap, and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties. Wait, but the states themselves have their own uncertainties. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state's energy, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let's think differently. When you have two states, each with a certain uncertainty in energy, the minimal energy difference required for them to be distinguishable is when the energy difference is greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if it's less than that sum, the two energy levels would overlap in the uncertainty ranges, making it impossible to resolve them.

But wait, perhaps each state's uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE = ħ/(2 Δt). So for each state, the uncertainty is inversely proportional to their lifetime.

Wait, let me get that right. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/(2π). So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2π Δt).

So for E1, which has a lifetime of 1e-9 seconds, ΔE1 = ħ/(2π * 1e-9). Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2π * 1e-8).

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let's call that ΔE = E2 - E1. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because each state's energy has its own uncertainty, and the energy difference needs to be larger than both so that they don't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty in either state. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

In an experiment, if you have two energy levels, the lines corresponding to their transitions would have a certain width determined by their lifetimes (i.e., uncertainties in energy). To distinguish two lines, their separation must be greater than the sum of their half-widths (or something like that). So in terms of energy, the separation should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps each energy level has a certain uncertainty, and the two levels can be resolved only if the separation is greater than the sum of their uncertainties. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the uncertainty of the system. For example, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurements for each state.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Since the two states have different lifetimes, their uncertainties in energy are different.

Let me try to compute the uncertainties.

Given ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s approximately.

So, for E1: Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 * π * Δt1) ≈ (1.05e-34) / (2 * 3.1416 * 1e-9) .

Let me calculate that:

Denominator: 2 * 3.1416 ≈ 6.2832. Multiply by 1e-9: 6.2832e-9.

So, 1.05e-34 / 6.2832e-9 ≈ (1.05 / 6.2832) * 1e-25.

1.05 /6.2832 ≈ 0.167.

So ΔE1 ≈ 0.167e-25 J.

But wait, the options are in eV. I need to convert Joules to eV. I remember that 1 eV ≈ 1.602e-19 J.

So, 0.167e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (0.167 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV.

0.167 / 1.602 ≈ 0.104.

So ΔE1 ≈ 0.104e-6 eV = 1.04e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 1.04e-7 eV, which is about 1e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 s.

So ΔE2 = ħ/(2π * 1e-8).

Same calculation as before except the denominator's Δt is 1e-8.

Denominator: 2 * π * 1e-8 = 6.2832e-8.

So ħ/(denominator) = 1.05e-34 / 6.2832e-8 ≈ (1.05 /6.2832) * 1e-26.

Same 1.05/6.2832 ≈ 0.167.

So 0.167e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 0.167e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (0.167 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV ≈ 0.104e-7 eV = 1.04e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is about 1e-7 eV, ΔE2 is about 1e-8 eV.

So the sum of the uncertainties is 1e-7 + 1e-8 = 1.1e-7 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than this sum to be resolvable.

Wait, but then the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Wait, no, the energies are E1 and E2, so ΔE = E2 - E1. But if the states are separate, but their energies have uncertainties, then the minimal ΔE for them to be distinguishable would be when ΔE is larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state.

Wait, no, I think more accurately, the energy levels have a certain uncertainty (the width of each line), and to resolve them, the separation between the centers must be larger than the sum of half the widths. Or perhaps the sum of the full widths? Hmm.

Wait, in spectroscopy, the resolving power of a spectrometer is given by the ratio of the separation between two peaks to the width of the peaks. The Rayleigh criterion says that the two maxima of the diffraction pattern (like for a grating) must be separated by at least the width of one peak (at half maximum) for them to be resolvable. So in that case, the separation needs to be greater than the sum of the half-widths.

Wait, but in terms of energy, the energy uncertainty ΔE for each state gives the half-width of the line. So to resolve two peaks, the separation must be greater than the sum of their half-widths.

But wait, in our case, the two states have their own ΔE1 and ΔE2. So the separation between them, ΔE, must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to be resolvable.

Wait, let me think. Each state's energy is a peak with a certain width. For example, E1 has a peak from E1 - ΔE1/2 to E1 + ΔE1/2, and E2 has a peak from E2 - ΔE2/2 to E2 + ΔE2/2. To ensure that the two peaks don't overlap, the lower edge of E2's peak must be above the upper edge of E1's peak, or vice versa. So the separation between the two centers, (E2 - E1), must be greater than (ΔE1/2 + ΔE2/2). So, the minimal separation would be (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2. So, the energy difference must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2.

Wait, but in our case, the options are for the actual energy difference, so ΔE must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2, or perhaps just greater than the sum ΔE1 + ΔE2? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps for two lines to be distinguishable, the separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the two lines' uncertainties would overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

Wait, let me think of it this way. Let’s say E1 has a range from E1 - ΔE1 to E1 + ΔE1, and E2 from E2 - ΔE2 to E2 + ΔE2. For them to be resolvable, the maximum of E1's range (E1 + ΔE1) must be less than the minimum of E2's range (E2 - ΔE2). So E1 + ΔE1 < E2 - ΔE2. Rearranging, E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2. So the separation must be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties.

So for the two energies to be clearly distinguishable, their energy difference must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, calculating this sum.

From before, ΔE1 is approximately 1e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 1e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 1.1e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than 1.1e-7 eV. Looking at the options, which of the choices is larger than 1.1e-7 eV?

Option A is 1e-9 eV. That's 0.001e-6, which is way smaller than 1e-7. So no.

Option B is 1e-11 eV. Even smaller. No.

Option C is 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV, which is larger than 1.1e-7 eV. So yes.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. 0.1e-7 eV, which is smaller than 1.1e-7 eV. So no.

So the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Calculating ΔE1: ħ/(2π Δt1) = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 3.1416 * 1e-9 s) ≈ 1.05e-34 / (6.283e-9) ≈ 1.67e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.67e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.04e-7 eV. So that's correct.

Similarly, ΔE2: ħ/(2π * 1e-8 s) = 1.05e-34 / (6.283e-8) ≈ 1.67e-27 J. In eV, 1.67e-27 /1.602e-19 ≈ 1.04e-8 eV.

So sum is 1.04e-7 + 1.04e-8 = 1.144e-7 eV.

Thus, the required ΔE is greater than 1.144e-7 eV. Among the options, only option C (1e-4 eV = 0.1e-3 eV) is much larger, so it's the correct choice.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly distinguished, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\pi},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy and \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (lifetime of the state). For distinguishability, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy for both states, \( \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \). This ensures that the energy levels do not overlap and can be resolved.

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties in energy
The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2\pi \Delta t}.
\]

For \( E_1 \), with a lifetime \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\pi \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2\pi \cdot 10^{-9}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \), with a lifetime \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\pi \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2\pi \cdot 10^{-8}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Sum of uncertainties
The total uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 1.04 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 1.04 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Required energy difference
For the two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 1.14 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

**Answer: C**
