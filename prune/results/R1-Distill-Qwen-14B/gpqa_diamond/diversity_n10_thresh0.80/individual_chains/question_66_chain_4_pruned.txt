Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators, and these operators are classified based on certain symmetries they must respect.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1, 2, 3, 4, and the possible choices are combinations of these. Let me think through each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think all operators in the SMEFT must conserve Lorentz symmetry. Because if they didn't, the theory would be non-relativistic, which doesn't make sense since the Standard Model is relativistic. So operators must be Lorentz scalars, meaning their tensor structures are Lorentz-invariant. So symmetry 1 is definitely a must.

Next, Poincaré symmetry. Wait, Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh right, because the SMEFT is a field theory, it's supposed to be a Lorentz-invariant theory, which implies Poincaré symmetry. Because Poincaré includes translations, but in the effective theory, the operators are local, so they must respect all Poincaré transformations. So symmetry 2 must also be respected. So options that include both 1 and 2 are possible. Looking at the choices, options A and C include 1 and 2.

Third, CP symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Do SMEFT operators have to respect CP symmetry? I remember that the Standard Model itself doesn't respect CP symmetry in all cases. Like, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So if the SM doesn't, then the SMEFT operators probably don't have to either. So SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. So symmetry 3 isn't necessarily a must, meaning operators don't have to respect it. So options that include 3 would be incorrect. So options B and D are out because they include 3.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT as an effective theory is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model, except where you add the higher-dimension operators. So the SM has some CP violation. So SMEFT operators can have terms that break CP? Or are the operators only allowed to respect the symmetries of the SM? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The SMEFT is built by adding operators that are consistent with the SM's gauge symmetry, but not necessarily all other symmetries like CP. Because the SM itself doesn't have CP as a symmetry. So in SMEFT, operators can violate CP, so the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So symmetry 3 is not a must. So any option including 3 is wrong.

Now, symmetry 4 is CPT symmetry. Wait, I think CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, including the Standard Model. So any operator that respects Lorentz symmetry would automatically respect CPT? Or is that the case? Because CPT symmetry is more about the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Wait, but in the SMEFT, all operators are required to respect CPT symmetry. Because the Standard Model itself respects CPT, and the effective operators don't break that. So 4 is a must.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all operators respect? 1 Lorentz, 2 Poincaré, and 4 CPT. So options that include 1,2,4 are correct.

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2 → includes 1 and 2, but not 4.

C) 1,2,4 → yes, this includes all three.

D) 1,3,4 → no, includes 3 which isn't required.

Wait, but earlier I thought Poincaré is included when you have Lorentz symmetry. Wait, does Poincaré symmetry automatically come into play because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant QFT? Because Poincaré includes translations, but in SMEFT, since it's a field theory, the operators are local, so I think Poincaré symmetry is already a given. So, do all
