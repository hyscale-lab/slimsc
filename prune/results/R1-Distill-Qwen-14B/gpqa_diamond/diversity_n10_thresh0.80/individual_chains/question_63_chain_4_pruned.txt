Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations, but wait, this says the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond vibrations, so it's a bit more complex.

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state absorbing a photon and transitioning to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of the absorbed photon. The options are given as A to D with different p values.

Let me break it down. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. When it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state? In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, I think the fundamental state is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. The next state would be the first excited state. But how does the energy transition work? I remember that for such a model, the energy levels are quantized and given by a combination of rotation and vibration. The total energy would be the sum of rotational energy (E_rot) and vibrational energy (E_vib).

But wait, the problem might be simplifying. Oh, perhaps the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor, but the non-rigid part might affect the moment of inertia. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model includes vibrational modes, so the bond length isn't fixed but can change, which affects the moment of inertia. Hmm, but for the purpose of finding the energy transition, maybe I should consider both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. For a diatomic molecule, the fundamental vibrational state is n=0 (ground state), and the rotational state is usually J=0 (but I might be mixing that up). So when it absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational state, rotational state, or both. But the question specifies the "next state with the lowest possible energy" which would imply the smallest possible energy increase. So the photon must cause the smallest possible jump.

In quantum mechanics, transitions can be either pure rotational, pure vibrational, or a combination. The pure vibrational transition would require a photon with energy equal to the difference between vibrational levels, which is usually higher than rotational transitions because bond vibrations have higher energy.

Wait, no, that's not right. The rotational energy levels are closer together than vibrational ones. So a pure rotational transition would require a photon of lower energy than a pure vibrational transition. But if the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), the next state could be J=1 (rotational) or n=1 (vibrational). The question is about the lowest possible energy transition. So which transition requires less energy: a rotational or a vibrational one?

The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. So the energy difference for the first vibrational transition (n=0 to n=1) is h*w. For the first rotational transition (J=0 to J=1), the energy difference is 2B (since E_rot goes from 0 to 2B).

Wait, so which is smaller, h*w or 2B? That depends on the values. Let's compute both.

Given w is 4e14 rad/s. h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So E_vib = h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now for B, the rotational constant. Rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass and R is the bond length.

Wait, let's compute μ first. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) = (40)/(22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu. But I need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

Then, I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². So I = 3.015e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Now, B is ħ²/(2I), where ħ is h/(2π). ħ ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.206e-46) = let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.206e-46 = 2.412e-46.

So B ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.412e-46) ) ≈ (1.112 / 2.412) *
