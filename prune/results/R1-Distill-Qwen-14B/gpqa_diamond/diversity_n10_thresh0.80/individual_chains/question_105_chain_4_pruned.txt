Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about a star with some dark spots and how it relates to the brightness variations we observe, similar to those from an exoplanet transit. Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of its star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness, which we can detect. But in this case, the star itself has spots, which also affect the brightness when the star rotates.

The problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar is the same as our Sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is 20%, right? So that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. And the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, while the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. They say that if the star weren't spotted, what exoplanet radius would produce the same signal? So, I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that of a planet transit.

First, let me think about how the spots affect the brightness. When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, causing a dip in brightness. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light. So the total brightness will depend on how much of the star is covered by these cooler regions.

The star's total luminosity without spots would be Lstar = 4πRstar²σTeff^4. But with spots, some fraction is cooler. The spots' area is 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, one hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface, right? So 20% of 50% is 10% of the total surface. Wait, no—no, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of a hemisphere. But wait, the area of a hemisphere is 2πR², and the total surface is 4πR². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, or 10%. Oh, so the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

But wait, the star is rotating, so only a part of the spotted hemisphere is visible at any time. Because it's a rotational modulation, when the spotted side is facing us, the brightness dips. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is facing us. So the brightness variation would be when the spots are fully visible, which is when the star's rotation brings that hemisphere into view.

Alternatively, maybe the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spotted side comes into view and the unspotted side is away. Wait, but the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So I think that the star has spots covering 20% of a single hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the amount of spots visible varies between 0 and 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait
