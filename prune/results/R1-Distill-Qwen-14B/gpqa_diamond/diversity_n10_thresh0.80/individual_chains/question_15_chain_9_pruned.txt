Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They have limited time, so they need to pick the one more likely to transit.

Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, same masses, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3.

They both have circular orbits. Their host stars have same radii, but different masses. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have same radii. Interesting.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But how does that relate to the other parameters given?

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, more accurately, it's the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius divided by the semi-major axis. But since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, maybe we can approximate it as R_star / a. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another way I've heard is that the probability is roughly (R_star / a), but also considering the inclination. But since RV method detects planets through Doppler shifts, which gives a lower mass limit and doesn't depend on inclination, except that the RV method is more sensitive to planets with higher masses or shorter periods, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, I think the transit probability is actually (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet << R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. So P ∝ R_star / a.

But wait, I should think about how the semi-major axis relates to the orbital period. Using Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_star + M_planet)) / (4π²). Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So a^3 is proportional to M_star * P^2. So a = (M_star * P²)^(1/3) * some constant.

So a is proportional to (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

Now, the transit probability P_transit is proportional to (R_star) / a. So substituting a from above, P_transit ∝ R_star / [ (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) ].

But wait, the question says both host stars have the same radii. So R_star is same for both. So P_transit ∝ 1 / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3) )

So for each planet, let's compute this ratio.

Let's denote:

For Planet_1: M1 is 2 * M2 (since Planet_1's
