Okay, so I need to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question involves a star with certain characteristics. So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where E2 is the energy of level 2, E1 is the energy of level 1, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near ultraviolet, I think. So the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. 

Let me calculate the energy difference (E2 - E1) using that wavelength. 

The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 m). Let me compute that.

First, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m:
1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but that's per photon. To get the energy difference in terms of eV (electron volts), maybe I should convert that. Because when dealing with thermal energies, eV is more convenient.

1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So:

1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, wait, that seems high. Hmm. Wait wait, the wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 0.1448 nm. That's in the near UV, so the energy would be around 8.5 eV? Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) =

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.373e-18 J is (1.373e-18)/(1.602e-19) = about 8.57 eV.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference between two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 is higher than E1 by 8.57 eV. That seems like a big energy jump. But maybe that's correct for some ions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the ionization energy. But Ti neutral is Ti I. The ionization energy for Ti I is about 7.1 eV. So an 8.5 eV photon would have enough energy to ionize it, but that's a detail for now.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), because n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight. So n1/n2 = (g1
