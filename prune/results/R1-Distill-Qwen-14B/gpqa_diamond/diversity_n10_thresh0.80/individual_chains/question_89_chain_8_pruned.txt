Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me break it down.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3. Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C should be an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it's likely an E2 mechanism. The product would be an alkene because two bromides are eliminated with two hydroxides taking their place, but wait, since it's KOH, the hydroxide would deprotonate and the bromides leave, forming a double bond.

So the product after KOH treatment is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Also, the NMR and IR spectra give clues. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's not just an alkene elimination, but something else. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a diene. But wait, the IR has 1720, which is more like a ketone or an ester. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: if elimination occurs, but maybe it's forming a carbonyl. Wait, wait, elimination of HBr twice would form a diene, but if it's a different reaction, like a substitution. No, KOH in such conditions is more likely elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged bicyclic compound. When heated with KOH, the bromides could eliminate, forming a more conjugated structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, forming an alkene. But then what would give a carbonyl group in the IR?

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some cyclization. Or perhaps a different mechanism. Alternatively, the product could be an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Wait, the IR's 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the first reaction forms an
