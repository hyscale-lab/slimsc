Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the setup: a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light's speed in the glass is slower than c because of the refractive index.

I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n. But wait, this is when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. Here, the medium is moving. So I think this is a scenario where I need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Right, because when objects are moving relative to the observer, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula is v' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the object in the medium's frame, and v is the medium's velocity relative to the observer.

Wait no, wait. Let me get this right. The medium is moving with velocity v relative to the lab. The light's velocity in the medium is u = c/n. But in which direction? Since the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion, when the medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is also
