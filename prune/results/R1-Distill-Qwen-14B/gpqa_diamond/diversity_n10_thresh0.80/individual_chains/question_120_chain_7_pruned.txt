Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. I remember that means the stars are spread out evenly, right? So their density is the same everywhere.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Oh wait, parallax is related to distance. I think parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if I have a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think their number density in space is constant. Wait, but how does that translate to the number in a given parallax range?

Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars depends on the volume. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a region is proportional to the volume of that region.

So, for a given parallax range, what's the corresponding volume? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx goes from p to p + dp, the distance goes from 1/p to 1/(p + dp). Wait, maybe I should model this mathematically.

Let me consider a thin shell at distance d. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dd, where dd is the thickness. But wait, the question is about parallax, so d = 1/plx. So, plx = 1/d. So, when plx increases, d decreases.

So, the volume element in terms of plx would involve dV in terms of plx. Let's see. So, d is 1/plx, so d = 1/p. Then, dd (change in d) would be the derivative of d with respect to p. So, dd = - (1/(p^2)) dp. Wait, because d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

The number of stars in a volume dV is proportional to dV, since the density is uniform. So, dN = n * dV, where n is the number density.

What's dV in terms of plx? Let me think about it. The volume between distance d and d+dd is 4πd² dd. Substituting d=1/p, we get 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ), but wait, the negative indicates direction, but since we're talking about a small increment, maybe I can ignore the sign and just take the magnitude. So, dV = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp ? Wait, that can't be right. Let me recast the variables.

Let me let p = 1/d. So, d = 1/p. Then, when p increases by dp, d decreases by dd = - dp / p². So, the change in d is -dp/p².

The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/p, and dd = (- dp)/p², we get:

dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp/p² ) 
= 4π (1/p²) * (- dp/p²)
= -4π dp / p^4

But since we're considering a positive dp (i.e., a small increase in p), the volume element becomes positive, so dV = 4π dp / p^4.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can express the number of stars in a range of p as the number per unit volume multiplied by the volume in that p range.

Since the galaxy is uniformly filled with stars, the number density n is a constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n * dV.

But dV is the volume corresponding to a change in p. So, dV = 4π (d)^2 dd, where d=1/p, and dd = - dp/(p²). So:

dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * (dp / p²) ) 
= 4π dp / p^4

So dN = n * dV = n * (4π dp / p^4 )

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So, it's dN/dp. Which would be n * (4π / p^4 )

Hmm, but that would imply that the number of stars per unit parallax is inversely proportional to p^4. So, the number decreases as p^4 increases.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that would match.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me think again about the setup.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density is uniform. So the
