Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step. 

The question says that the unknown compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a broad peak around 3000 cm^-1, which I remember usually corresponds to O-H stretching. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate hydrogen bonding, so this might be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or something like that. Oh wait, but the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which is often a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or something else. 

Wait, if there are two strong peaks around 1700 and 1650, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Or perhaps it's a conjugated system. For example, maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a ketone or ester, but the exact positions can vary. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic ring's stretching, like C=C stretching. So maybe it's an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, probably in an alkene or maybe in a ring like aromatic. 

The mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is a common m/z for something like a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, wait. 45 could be (CH3O) which has a molecular weight of 31 (CH3O is 15+16=31?), no wait. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a carbonyl group. No, wait. Let me think about common fragments. For example, CH2=O (formyl group) would be 30, but that's not 45. Wait, maybe it's an ethyl group or something else. Or maybe it's a fragment like C3H7 or something. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to a (CH2)2O or something else. Wait, m/z 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 31. Hmm, no. Wait, let me calculate. The molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So the possible molecular formulas are all C6H something O.

Wait, the mass spectrum fragment is at 45. Let's see: molecular ion peaks are usually the molecular weight, but sometimes fragments. For the molecular formula, let's compute the molecular weights.

C6H12O: (6*12) + (12*1) + (16) = 72 +12 +16=100 g/mol.

C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

C6H12O2: 72 +12 +32=116.

So the possible molecular weights are 100, 98, 114, 116.

The fragment at 45 would be a part of the molecule, so maybe a smaller fragment. Let's see what 45 could be. 45 is the molecular weight of something like C3H7O2? No, wait, C3H7O2 would be 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16*2=32. 36+7+32=75. Hmm, no. Alternatively, 45 is C3H3O (3*12=36, 3=3, 16=16; 36+3+16=55. No. Wait, 45 can be broken down into:

45 = 12 * 3 + 12 + 3. Hmm, maybe (CH3)2CO â€“ that's 58. Wait, maybe it's CH3COO- as a fragment, but that's 60. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, think about common fragments. 45 could be (CH2)2O, which is 48. No, that's not right. Wait, (CH3)2CO is 58. Hmm. Or maybe a ketene group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetylation fragment. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone, like CH3CO- would be 43 (44 if you include a Cl, but no). Alternatively, maybe the fragment is something else.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 6*12 +12 +32= 72+12=84, +32=116. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 116. The fragment at 45 could be a part of this. Let's see: maybe a (CH2O) group. Wait, CH2O is formaldehyde, which is 30. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe a fragment from a diethyl group. Or maybe the molecule has an ester group, like O-CO-O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a (CH3CO) group. Let's calculate: CH3CO is 58? Wait, CH3CO is 12*2 + 1*4 + 16 = 24 +4 +16=44. So 44 is close to 45, but not exactly. Wait, maybe an oxygen is included. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH2O) group but with some other atoms.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is a (CH3COO-) group. Let's calculate: CH3COO- is 60. Hmm, but the peak is at 45, which is lower. Maybe the fragment is a smaller part, like a (CH3O) group, but that is 31. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 comes from a CH2=CH-O- group. Let me calculate: CH2=CHO- would be 45? Wait, CH2=CH-O- is 12*2 +1*4 +16 = 24 +
