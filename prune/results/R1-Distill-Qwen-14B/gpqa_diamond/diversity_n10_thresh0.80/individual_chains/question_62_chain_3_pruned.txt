Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. So, the main chain is cyclohexane with a substituent and a carbonyl group. Wait, the formula is a bit complex. Let me parse it: the cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group (so an aldehyde at position 1) and another substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexane ring.

Looking at the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond attached). So, structure is cyclohexane-CCâ‰¡CH.

The question is about the sequence of reagents needed to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's think about the reactions that could take us there.

First, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2OH group. Wait, the substituent is cyclohexyl (CH2OH) attached to the main cyclohexane. Or wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, meaning it's a CH2 group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl substituent. So, the substituent is CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexyl? No, wait, maybe it's CH2 connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) attached to the main cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group that's substituted with a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the main ring has a substituent at position 1 which is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), and also a carbaldehyde group.

Wait, no. Let me try again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group at position 1. Then, at position 1 of the cyclohexane, there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the structure is: the main cyclohexane ring has an aldehyde group. The substituent at position 1 (same carbon as the aldehyde?) is a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl.

But wait, cyclohexyl is a six-membered ring. So, it's a
