Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

Hmm. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is usually around pH 7, but maybe a bit higher because the salt formed (acetate) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The initial solution is a dilution of acetic acid. So first, I should calculate the concentration after dilution.

The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. To find the new concentration, I can use M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40? Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol? Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Oh wait, perhaps better to calculate in moles.

Molarity is moles per liter. So initial moles of acetic acid = 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, total volume is 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So diluted to 0.025 M.

Then, during titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is
