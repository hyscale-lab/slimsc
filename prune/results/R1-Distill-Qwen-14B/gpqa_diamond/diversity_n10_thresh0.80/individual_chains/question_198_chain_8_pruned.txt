Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes and determining the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species in the solution. Let me break down what I know.

First, let's understand the problem. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think these β values are for the complexes [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n increases with each β.

Wait, stability constant β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. For the first complex, it would be β1, then β2 for the second, and so on. So, each β corresponds to adding another SCN- ligand.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm not entirely sure which complex that is. Dithiocyanato usually implies two SCN- ligands. So that's probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which is the second complex. But wait, the options don't directly say that, but the wording says "blue dithiocyanato" which I think refers to the second complex.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer is a percentage. So we need to find the mole fraction or the proportion of the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex relative to all possible Co species.

Hmm, I think the general approach is to calculate the distribution of each complex based on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN^-.

Wait, the formation of the complexes is stepwise. The first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, then the second [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on. Each step has its own stability constant, and the overall stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise β's up to n.

Wait, no. Wait, the β given are the overall stability constants for each complex. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+; β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+; β3 is for [Co(SCN)_3]^3+; β4 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^4+.

So, each β is for the complex with n SCN- ligands, where n=1,2,3,4. So the overall formation constant for each is given as β1, β2, etc.

So, the problem is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (the second complex) among all Co species.

The total cobalt species will include all possible complexes from n=0 (free Co^2+) up to n=4, plus any uncomplexed Co^2+.

Wait, no, wait. The total concentration of Co includes all the species: free Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4+. Because each complex forms stepwise, and the distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

So, to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), we need to calculate the fraction of Co that is in the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ form.

The approach is to model the distribution of each complex using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Let me think about how to model this. We can consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the concept of the formation constants.

The general formula for the fraction of each complex is determined by the concentration of Co, the concentration of SCN, and the stability constants.

Wait, but the concentrations are given as [Co] = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. But wait, [Co] is the total concentration of all Co species. So [Co] = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^3+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^4+.

But since the solution is in a relatively low concentration of Co and high concentration of SCN, the complexes are likely to form, and the higher-order complexes may be more prevalent.

To calculate the fractions, we can use the concept of the formation of each complex step by step.

Let me think step by step.

First, we can write the formation of each complex:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ with β1 = 9.

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_
