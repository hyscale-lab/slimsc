Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let me draw that structure mentally. So, it's a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group attached to a cyclohexyl group through a CH(OH)-CH2- group? Or wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH and another CH2. Wait, maybe it's more like the cyclohexane has a substituent that's a CH group, which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Or perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group, and another substituent as an aldehyde. No, wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Let me parse the name again.

The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. The substituent is at the 1 position, which is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, the cyclohexane ring has an aldehyde group, and attached to the same carbon (position 1) is a CH2 group which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde at C1 and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to that same C1. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexyl?

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring where the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) methyl group. Or maybe, the substituent is a CH2 group that's attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Hmm, maybe the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-OH
