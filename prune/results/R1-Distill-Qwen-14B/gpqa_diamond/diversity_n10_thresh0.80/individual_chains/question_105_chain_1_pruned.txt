Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm.

Alright, the question is about a star with some dark spots. The star has the same radius as the Sun, right? So R_star is the same as the Sun's radius, which I think is about 7e5 km, but maybe the exact number isn't necessary here.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. Oh wait, dark spots would be cooler, so the spot temperature must be 5000K, I guess. Because the difference is 1000K, and the star is 6000K, so spots are 5000K.

The filling factor is 20%, which means the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere they're on. Wait, the question says only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So the total area covered by spots is 20% of a hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface area, then the spots cover 0.2 * (π R² / 2 ) = 0.1 π R². So the spot area is 10% of the star's total surface area.

Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So each hemisphere (like the front and back) is 50% of the star's surface. So if the filling factor is 20%, then the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the total spot area is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4π R²) ), wait no, perhaps the filling factor is the fraction of the total surface area. Wait, no, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%". Oh, so the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2π R² (since the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², each hemisphere is half, so 2π R²). So spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². But wait, the total area of the star is 4 π R², so the spot fraction is 0.4 pi R²
