Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about three different reactions, all Michael additions, and I need to figure out the products for each, then match them with the options given.

First, I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → A.

Wait, the Michael addition typically involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So I think dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile here because it's a good donor, and the other compound would be the Michael acceptor.

Let me recall. Dimethyl malonate has the structure CH2(COOEt)2. It's a good nucleophile because the enolate form is stabilized by two adjacent ester groups. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, with the E geometry, and the p-tolyl group on the acrylate.

In the Michael addition, the enolate attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the acrylate's beta position. Let me draw this out.

The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so the carbonyl is at C3. The enolate will attack the C2 (beta) position. That would form a new bond between the C of the enolate and C2.

Wait, but the enolate is from dimethyl malonate. So the enolate is: CH- (with two ester groups on either side). So when it attacks the acrylate's beta position, the structure would combine. Let me think about the connectivity.

So dimethyl malonate's enolate is CH2(COOEt)–. It attacks the acrylate at the beta (middle) carbon. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The enolate attacks the CH2=CH– part. Wait, no, wait. The acrylate is CH2=CH–COOCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=CH–COOCH3, with the double bond between C1 and C2, and the carbonyl at C3.

So the Michael addition would proceed by the enolate attacking the beta carbon (C2) of the acrylate. So the enolate's carbon would form a bond with C2.

So the product would be a new molecule where the enolate has added across the double bond. Let's see: the starting materials are dimethyl malonate (which has two ester groups) and the acrylate, which is another ester.

So when the enolate attacks, the structure would form a new carbon-carbon bond. The enolate has two ester groups, so the product after protonation would have three ester groups, I think.

Wait, perhaps it's better to visualize it. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. Its enolate is CH–[COOEt]2. This enolate attacks the beta carbon (CH2=CH–) of the acrylate.

So the acrylate is CH2=CH–COOCH3. After the attack, the enolate's carbon (from CH2(COOEt)2–) would bond with the CH2 in CH2=CH, so that the double bond becomes single, and the enolate's carbon adds to it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the structure after addition. The product would have a structure where the enolate's carbon (from mal
