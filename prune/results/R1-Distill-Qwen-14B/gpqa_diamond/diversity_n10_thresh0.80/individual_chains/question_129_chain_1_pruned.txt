Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with compound A and ending with compound E. I need to figure out what compound E is, based on the given options and the reaction steps. There are also some hints provided, so I should pay attention to those.

Let me list out the reactions first:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR spectra: A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, E around 1715 cm^-1.

Let me start by analyzing each reaction step.

First, the reaction of A with HCN gives B. HCN is a nucleophile and typically adds to carbonyl groups. So I'm thinking that A might have a ketone group because HCN adding to a ketone would give a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but that would produce a different structure, perhaps. So if A is a ketone, then B would have a CN group attached where the carbonyl was.

Wait, but another possibility is that A is an ester or another carbonyl-containing compound. But since HCN adds to ketones, maybe that's the starting point.

Next, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. H2 with Pd is hydrogenation. If B has a nitrile group (from HCN addition), then hydrogenation would reduce the nitrile to an amine. Wait, no, wait. Wait, HCN adds to a carbonyl group to form a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol with a cyanide group adjacent. Wait, no, correction: when a ketone reacts with HCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with an -OH group and a -CN group on
