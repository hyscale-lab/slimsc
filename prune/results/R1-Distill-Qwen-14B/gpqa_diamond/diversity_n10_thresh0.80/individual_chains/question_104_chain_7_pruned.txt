Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's presence.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. So, the planets have similar masses, and the stars are identical in mass. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is: How much longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Wait, I think the RV shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is given by something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ something... Wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

I recall the formula for semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that for two planets, the ratio of their velocities can be related to the ratio of their periods. Since both stars are the same mass and both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), perhaps the masses are the same or can be considered the same for this problem. Also, the orbits are circular, so e is zero, which I think makes the denominator in K's formula just 1. So, sin i is 1 (edge-on orbits) because that's when the maximum velocity is observed, right?

So, the formula for K (velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I'm trying to simulate thinking without resources. Let me think again.

The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the star's velocity. The formula is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π) ) ]^(-1/3) * [ (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps that's not the exact formula. Maybe I should consider Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period and the semi-major axis.

Kepler's third law in the form for a star-planet system (since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's) is:

P² = (4π²/G M_*) ) * a³

Where a is the semi-major axis of the
