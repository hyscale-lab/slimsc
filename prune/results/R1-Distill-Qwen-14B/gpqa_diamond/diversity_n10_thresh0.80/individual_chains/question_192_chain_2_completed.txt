Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's see.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s from the conductor's center, and the cavity's radius is r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, point P is outside the conductor, so its distance from the conductor's center is L. But it's also at a distance l from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta. Oh, and l and L are both greater than R.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, it initially has no net charge. But when a charge is placed inside the cavity, it induces charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right. The inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge of equal magnitude but opposite sign, so -q. But wait, no, the conductor was initially neutral, so the inner surface would have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then the outer surface must have +q to balance it, because the conductor as a whole is neutral? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero.

Wait, when a charge +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor's material can't have a net charge inside; the electric field inside the conductor (the material) must be zero. So the inner surface has -q, and since the overall conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. So the +q is on the outer surface.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere. If the cavity is off-center, meaning s is not zero, then the inner surface charge is -q. But because the cavity is not at the center, the inner charge distribution might be asymmetric. But wait, the conductor's material is a conductor, so does that affect the distribution?

Wait, no. The conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the inner surface must arrange themselves to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the inner surface has -q, but because the cavity is not at the center, the -q would be somewhere. Wait, no, I think in this case, the inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, but its distribution might not be uniform. But when considering the electric field outside the conductor, I think the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the outer surface is a sphere. Because the conductor is spherical, the outer surface can have a uniform charge distribution regardless of the cavity's position.

Wait, maybe not. If the cavity is off-center, the inner surface would have a non-uniform charge distribution. But the outer surface, being a sphere, would still have a uniform charge distribution because any external fields would be from the point charge q. But wait, no, the outer surface is a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. So the outer surface's charge distribution is determined by external fields and symmetry.

Wait, but the point charge is inside the cavity. So the outer surface of the conductor, being a sphere, would have a uniform charge distribution of +q, right? Because the conductor was initially neutral and the inner surface has -q, so the outer must have +q.

Wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q because the total conductor is uncharged. But wait, that's a net charge of zero for the conductor. So the inner surface is -q, the outer is +q, making the total zero.

Wait, no, that would make the conductor's net charge zero. Because the initial conductor is neutral, adding +q inside the cavity induces -q on the inner surface, and the outer surface must have +q so that the total charge of the conductor is (-q) + (+q) = 0. Hmm, that makes sense.

But wait, the conductor was neutral before the charge was placed inside. So now, the inner surface of the conductor has -q, and the outer surface has +q, since the total must be zero. So the conductor's net charge is zero, but it has these induced charges.

Now, the question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. So outside the conductor, the electric field would be due to the charges on the outer surface. Since the outer surface is a sphere with radius R and charge +q, the electric field outside should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Because of the spherical symmetry, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, so the electric field outside is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²), where L is the distance from the center to point P.

Wait, but what about the position of the cavity? The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta. So the geometry is a bit more complicated. Hmm, but since the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, the electric field outside depends only on the distance from the center of the conductor, not on the position of the cavity.

Wait, no. Wait, another thought. Because the cavity is off-center, the inner induced charge is -q but not uniformly distributed. The outer induced charge is +q, but because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface is symmetric. So for any point outside the sphere, the field would be as if all the charge were at the center. So point P's field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a uniformly charged sphere. So regardless of where the inner charge is, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform. So any point outside the conductor feels a field as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

So the answer would be option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but what about the position of P relative to the cavity's center? The options have expressions that involve l and s and theta. Could that influence the field?

Hmm. Maybe if the conductor wasn't a sphere, but in this case, it's a sphere. So the outer surface's symmetry ensures that the field outside depends only on L.

Wait, another approach: Using the superposition principle. The total electric field outside the conductor would be the sum of the field due to the charge in the cavity and the induced charges on the conductor.

But wait, the conductor's induced charges: the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the net field outside should be due to the outer surface's +q, because the inner surface's -q would create a field inside the conductor, which is zero.

Wait, more accurately, the inner surface's field is only felt within the conductor. Outside, only the outer surface's charge affects the field. So the field at P is due to the +q charge on the outer surface, which is a sphere.

So yes, the field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, let me check the other options. Option A has (l - s cos theta)^2 in the denominator. That would be the case if the charge were at a certain position relative to P, but since the outer surface is a sphere, the distance from P to the center is L, and the field depends only on that.

Option C has (l + s cos theta)^2. Hmm, not sure, but probably not the right approach.

Option D is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / l². That would be the case if the field were due to the charge in the cavity, but since P is outside the conductor, the conductor's induced charges shield it from the inner charge. So the field outside should only be due to the outer charge, not the inner.

So yes, the correct answer is B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is offset from the conductor's center by a distance $s$, and the radius of the cavity is $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center and $l$ from the cavity's center. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges**: Since the conductor is initially neutral, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor, being a sphere, uniformly distributes a charge of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center. The outer surface's uniform charge distribution ensures that the electric field outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Relevance of Geometry**: While the cavity is off-center (with $s \neq 0$), the outer surface's uniform charge distribution ensures that the electric field outside the conductor is independent of the cavity's position or the point $P$'s specific location relative to the cavity. The field at $P$ depends solely on $L$, the distance from $P$ to the conductor's center.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which would apply if the field were directly influenced by the cavity's position. However, the outer surface's symmetry ensures this is not the case.
   - **Option B**: Matches the expected field for a point charge $+q$ at the center of a sphere, given by $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, where $L$ is the distance from the center to $P$. This is correct.
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is not relevant here due to the outer surface's uniform charge distribution.
   - **Option D**: Suggests the field depends on $l^2$, the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center. However, the conductor's shielding effect ensures that the field outside depends only on $L$, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as the electric field at $P$ is determined solely by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from $P$ to the conductor's center.

Answer: B
