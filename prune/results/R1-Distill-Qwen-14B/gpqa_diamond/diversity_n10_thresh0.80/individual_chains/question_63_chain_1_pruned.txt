Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching states after absorbing a photon. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, or is it the rigid rotor and then vibration? I think the non-rigid rotor allows for bond length changes, but in this case, they give a bond length R, so maybe it's treated as a rigid rotor for the rotational part, but the vibration is considered. Hmm, but the question is about the fundamental state and switching to the next state. Oh wait, maybe it's about the energy levels in rotation or vibration?

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, right? So for a diatomic molecule, the ground state is usually the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), I think. So when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next lowest energy state. But what's the next state? Because the energy levels can change in either rotation or vibration.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia, and J is the rotational quantum number. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (v + 1/2), where v is the vibrational
