Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, this seems like a 2-dimensional metric because it's written in terms of dx² and dy². Oh right, so it's a 2D spacetime, probably a slice of something.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So, the line element depends on the coordinates x and y. I think this looks similar to the metric for a sphere, but maybe with some scaling factors. Wait, or is it a hyperbolic metric? No, because the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests it's a sphere-like structure but scaled.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like in hyperbolic geometry. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, a pseudosphere might be a higher-dimensional object, but in this question, it's 2D.

Wait, the term "pseudosphere of radius r=2" — I think that might be a term used in some contexts, like in 2D, perhaps a hyperbolic plane? Or maybe it's a sphere in a different metric.

Wait, the metric here is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let's think about the standard metric for a sphere. The standard metric for a 2D sphere of radius a is ds² = a² (dx² + dy²)/( (a² - x² - y² )) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard metric for, say, spherical coordinates is a bit different. Wait, maybe it's more like the metric for a sphere embedded in 3D, but perhaps expressed in 2D coordinates.

Alternatively, think about conformally flat metrics. Because this metric is conformally flat, as it's a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So the area element in 2D would be the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dxdy. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is just (32/(4-x² - y² )) squared times something? Wait, no, the determinant for a 2D metric diag(A, A) is A². Wait, in 2D, the metric tensor is:

g = [ A 0 ]
     [0 A ]

So determinant is A². So the square root of the determinant is A, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²) here. So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but the area would then be the integral of this over the region where the metric is defined. So the denominator 4 - x² - y² must be positive to have real values, so 4 - x² - y² >0 → x² + y² <4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the area would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of 32/(4 -x² -y²) dx dy.

Hmm, so that's a double integral. Let's change to polar coordinates for easier integration. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r². So the integral becomes:

Integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2 (since r² <4 → r<2) of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So let's compute this. The integral is 32 * ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the angular integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

Now the radial integral: ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=4}^{u=0} (1/u) (-1/2) du → because the limits are from 4 to 0, and the negative sign reverses them, we get (1/2) ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

Which is (1/2) [ln u ] from 0 to4. Wait, but ln u as u approaches 0 is negative infinity. Oh wait, that's a problem. So the integral ∫0^4 (1/u) du is divergent. So the radial integral is (1/2)(ln 4 - ln 0) → which is (1/2)(finite - (-infinity)) = infinity.

So the area element is 32 * 2π * [divergent integral] → which is infinite. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, but in this metric, the radius might be related to the curvature. Let me think. The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²). If we consider this as a 2D Lorentzian metric, perhaps it's a sphere in 2D with some properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere's radius being 2 is connected to the denominator 4. Let me think, 4 is (2)^2. So maybe the radius is 2, which is tied to the denominator.

But regardless, the area came out to be divergent because the integral is infinite. So the area is infinite. Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the correct answer would be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D spacetime. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we compute the area element in this metric. For a conformally flat metric, the area element is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\), and thus the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of integration is determined by the condition \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which corresponds to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). This is a circle of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the angular integral:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-1/2}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges because \(\ln u\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the radial integral is infinite, and the total area is:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \infty = +\infty.
\]

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
