Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength for a black body, which relates to temperature.

Then, the radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is how fast they're moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect the observed luminosity or the calculation here?

The question says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor, and we need to find that factor from the options given.

Hmm, let's think about what affects luminosity. I remember that the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh wait, but σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and R is radius, T is temperature. So L depends on R squared and T to the fourth power.

But wait, the stars are being treated as black bodies. So the key variables are radius and temperature. Also, their peak wavelengths are the same. Because the peak wavelength λ_max is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if their λ_max is the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, T is same. Oh, interesting, so T1 = T2.

Wait, but the question says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So that's the same as saying T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

So, since T is same for both, the luminosity ratio would depend only on their radii. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. So if T is same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2: R1 = 1.5 R2.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23. Hmm, but wait, am I missing anything else?

Oh, wait, the question also mentions the radial velocities. How does that play in?

The radial velocity is the speed at which the star moves towards or away from us. When a star has a high radial velocity, it can cause a Doppler shift in its emitted light. So the observed wavelength would shift.

Wait, but wait. The peak wavelengths are determined by the star's temperature, right? So if a star is moving towards us, its emitted light is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the radial velocities affect the observed temperature, which then affects the observed luminosity.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Each star emits light with a certain peak wavelength based on their actual temperature. But if the star is moving towards us (or away), the observed wavelength shifts.

So for Star_1, radial velocity is 0 km/s. So its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away or towards us, the observed wavelength would change.

Wait, no. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that's the observed λ_max for each star. So for each star, their observed λ_max is the same. But their actual emitted λ_max depends on their temperatures.

So, let's model this. Let's denote the actual temperature of Star_1 as T1, and Star_2 as T2. The observed λ_max for each would be shifted due to their radial velocities.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ_max (after Doppler shift) is the same for both stars. So the observed wavelengths are same. But their actual (intrinsic) temperatures may be different.

Wait, no. Let's see. The problem says: "they are the same." So the observed λ_max for both stars is same. So their actual λ_max (emitted) would have been shifted by their respective velocities.

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me try to model it.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity (in units where c is 1, or in km/s but scaled appropriately). But this is for non-relativistic speeds, which is the case here because 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s). So we can approximate it as λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r / c), assuming v_r is in the same direction as the velocity (if moving away, v_r is positive; moving towards, it's negative).

Wait, but the problem is that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Let me denote the emitted λ_max for Star_1 as λ1_emit, and for Star_2 as λ2_emit. The observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1_obs = λ1_emit (1 - v_r1 / c ), since Star_1 has v_r1=0, so λ1_obs = λ1
