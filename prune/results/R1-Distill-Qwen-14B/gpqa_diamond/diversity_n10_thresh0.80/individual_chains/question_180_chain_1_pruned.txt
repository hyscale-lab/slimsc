Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. 

The question says there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. Out of these, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, so since all the particles are identical and have the same charge, I'm thinking this has to do with electric potential energy. Because when you have charges arranged in space, their potential energy contributes to the system's total energy.

Wait, so the 13th charge is fixed at point P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of those 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge at P.

I remember that the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula for potential energy: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since all the charges are the same, each pair will have the same potential energy.

But wait, in this case, how many pairs are we considering? Let me think. The 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges at 2m away will have a potential energy interaction with the fixed charge. Also, the 12 charges themselves are at 2m from P, but are they all at the same point? I don't think so; because if they are constrained to stay at 2m, but not necessarily at the same location, their mutual distances could vary. Oh, but wait, the problem says they are each at 2m from P but their mutual distances might not be specified. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, but the question asks for the minimum energy of the system. So maybe I should minimize the potential energy. I remember that for a system of charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So to minimize the total potential energy, the charges should be arranged in such a way that the potential energy is as low as possible.

But if all the 12 charges are placed as far apart as possible from each other, that would minimize repulsion. Wait, but in this case, each
