Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves finding probabilities of measuring a particle in certain eigenstates and then calculating the average value of an operator. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the state vector is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities are involved. So, to normalize, I have to calculate the magnitude squared of each component and sum them up.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let's compute their magnitudes. 

For the first term, (1+i): the magnitude is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). So the square is 2.

Second term, (2-i): magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). Square is 5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator's matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin up and down states. So the matrix looks like:
[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Hmm, that's a spin operator in the x-direction. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so scaling it by ħ/2. So the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the operator A in question.

So the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x>, corresponding to eigenvalues. Let me recall: σ_x |+x> = |+x>, so A |+x> = (ħ/2)|+x>, and similarly A |-x> = -(ħ/2)|-x>.

But wait, in our case, the operator A has elements A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as I thought. So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are ±ħ/2. The probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the state |alpha> in each eigenstate.

Wait, but how do I express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A? Because operator A's eigenstates are different from |up> and |down>. 

So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. Alternatively, perhaps compute the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

Let me find the expressions for |+x> and |-x>. 

The eigenstates of σ_x are:
|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>,
