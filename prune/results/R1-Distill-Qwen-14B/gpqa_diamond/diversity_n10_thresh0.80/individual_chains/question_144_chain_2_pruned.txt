Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance and calculating the mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says X is a meson resonance. We're given E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. So, I need to find the mean decay distance.

I remember that the mean decay distance (or mean proper decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I think is L = v * τ * c, but wait, no, actually, the mean proper decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime, but I might be mixing terms here. Or wait, since particles are moving, it's the speed multiplied by the lifetime. Oh, right, but the proper lifetime is when the particle is at rest. So the mean decay length L is v multiplied by the lifetime τ multiplied by the speed of light? Or is it just c multiplied by the lifetime? Hmm, maybe I should get the proper formula.

Wait, the mean decay length is given by L = (c * τ) * β, where β is v/c. Because the particle is moving, so the actual distance it travels before decaying depends on its speed. So L = cτβ. Alternatively, another approach is to use the relation between the particle's lifetime and its energy.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is the mean decay length L = (c * Γ^{-1}) * (something). Wait, no, Γ is the decay width, which is related to the lifetime. Oh right, the uncertainty principle says Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, let's correct the formula: the relation between the decay width Γ and the lifetime τ is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the decay length. But wait, the particle is moving with some velocity, so the observed decay length is L = v * τ. Oh, but v depends on the energy of the particle. Because E_X is given as 8 GeV, which is the energy of the meson.

So first, I need to find the velocity of the meson. The energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass of the
