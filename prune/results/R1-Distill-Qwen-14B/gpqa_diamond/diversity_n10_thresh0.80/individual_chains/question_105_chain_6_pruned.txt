Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because the star is spotted, when it rotates, the brightness changes, which can look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The task is to find what the radius of a planet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots.

So, the problem is about comparing the photometric variations caused by star spots to those caused by a planet. The key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the signal) for both cases and set them equal, then solve for the planet's radius.

First, I need to remember how the brightness variation works for both cases.

When a star has spots, the spots are cooler, so when they rotate into our view, the total brightness decreases. The amount depends on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

For a planet transiting in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The blocked area is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. The change in brightness is this area times the star's flux.

Wait, but in the case of spots, the variation is due to the changing visibility of the spots as the star rotates. So, the star's brightness goes down when more spots are visible, and up when fewer are. But when we're considering the amplitude of the variation, perhaps it's the maximum change compared to the unspotted star.

Let me think about the star without spots first. If the star were unspotted, its flux would be F = σTeff^4 * (4πRstar²) / (4πD²), but since D is the distance, when we consider the flux change, D cancels out. So the total flux is proportional to Rstar² * Teff^4.

When the star has spots, each spot has a lower temperature. Let's model the spots as regions with temperature T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20%, so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.2. Wait, but the problem says only one hemisphere is covered in spots. Hmm, that might complicate things. Because when the star rotates, the visible spots change. Let me reread that part.

The star has one hemisphere (so half the surface area) covered with spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. Oh, okay, so filling factor f is 0.2. So the whole star's surface has two hemispheres, each 50% of the area. One hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots. So the total spotted area is (0.5 * 4πR²) * 0.2 = 0.4π R².

Wait, let's think again. The star's surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is the area 2πR². If the filling factor is 20%, then the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4π R² / 4π R² = 0.1, or 10% of the entire star's surface.

But when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since it's only one hemisphere, when the star is viewed from the side, only that hemisphere's spots are visible. So when the star is at a certain rotational phase, the spots might be in front or behind, affecting the observed flux.

Wait, the question says that the star's photometric time-series will show periodic variations due to rotation. The amplitude of these variations is similar to what a planet would cause. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

So, let's compute the amplitude caused by the spots, and then find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

The flux without any spots is F0. The flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 - (fraction of spotted area) * (ΔF per spot).

Wait, each spot emits less flux. Let's compute the flux with and without the spots.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * (4πRstar²) / (4πD²) ) = σTeff^4 Rstar² / D².

When spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (number of spotted regions) * (their area) * (their flux per unit area).

Each spot has area A_spot and emits F_spot = σ T_spot^4, per unit area.

But wait, the star is a sphere, so each spot's area is a fraction of the total area, and the flux is the sum over all spots.

Alternatively, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions plus the flux from the spotted regions.

F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * σ T_spot^4 / (σ Teff^4) * F0.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible.

The fractional change ΔF/F0 is equal to the fractional area of spots (f) multiplied by (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4).

Because the spots contribute less flux. So the change in flux when the spots are visible is the number of spots times their area times their lower flux.

Wait, but since the spots are on a hemisphere, and when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Let me think. Since the observer sees one hemisphere at a time, but the spots are on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are blocking. So the maximum dimming occurs when the spots are fully visible.

So the maximum amplitude (maximum decrease in flux) would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is in view. So the observed flux when the spots are fully visible is F = F0 - (f * F_spot).

But let me think more carefully.

The unspotted part of that hemisphere contributes its full flux. The spotted part contributes less.

Wait, the star is covered with spots in one hemisphere, but when we look at the star, we see either that hemisphere or the other. So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F0. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F0 * (1 - f) + f * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me model the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

The entire star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one with spots (covering 20% of that hemisphere) and one without. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F = (1 - f) * F0 * (1/2) + f * F_spot * (1/2) + (other hemisphere) which is F0 * (1/2).

Wait, maybe a better way is to model the entire star. The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π R²)/(4π D²) ) = σ Teff^4 R² / D².

When a fraction f of the surface is covered by spots, the total flux is:

F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * σ T_spot^4 * (R² / D²) * (1/(4π)) * 4π R² * (f / (4π R²))).

Wait, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to compute the fractional change, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, wait, the amplitude is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view. The other hemisphere is unspotted and emits at F0. The spotted hemisphere emits less in the areas covered by spots.

Alternatively, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F0. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F0*(1 - f) + f * F_spot, where F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spot.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F = (1 - f) * (F0) +
