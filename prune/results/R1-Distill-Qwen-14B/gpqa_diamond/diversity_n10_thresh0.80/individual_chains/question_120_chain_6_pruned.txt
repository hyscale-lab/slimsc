Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's see. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are different power laws, from 1 over parallax squared up to the fourth power.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us because plx = 1/distance. So as plx increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. Hmm. So if I consider a range of parallaxes, how does the count of stars in that range vary with plx.

Wait, I think I remember something about the distribution of stars in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, then the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume.

But how do we relate this to parallax? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so higher parallax means closer stars. So let's model this.

Suppose stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density n is constant. The volume element in spherical coordinates would be something like 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in a shell between r and r + dr is n * 4π r² dr.

But wait, the question is about parallax. Since plx = 1/d (d is distance), then d = 1/plx. So as plx increases (from, say, plx to plx + dplx), the distance decreases from d to d - dd, where dd = 1/(plx^2) dplx?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of plx. Let's set d = 1/plx. Then for a small change in plx, dplx, the range in plx is dplx, and the corresponding change in distance is dd = -d^2 dplx, because d = 1/plx, so dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dd = -d² dplx.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the number of stars per unit plx. So perhaps I should express the volume in terms of plx.

Let me think: The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is 4π d² dr * n. But since d is 1/plx, dr = - d² dplx, because d = 1/plx → dr = -1/(plx²) dplx. So substituting, the number of stars in that thin shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/(plx^2)) dplx * n. Wait, but the number can't be negative, so maybe I should take absolute value. So it becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx * n.

Wait, but that gives me 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number of stars per unit plx (like dplx) would be proportional to 1/plx^4. That would correspond to option A.

Wait, but that seems really high. Let me see if I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me try a different approach. The number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx is the number of stars in the volume between d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx. So the volume of that shell is 4π (d + dd)^2 - 4π d^2. Expanding that gives 4π [d² + 2 d dd + (dd)^2 - d²] = 4π [2 d dd + (dd)^2]. Since dd is small, (dd)^2 is negligible, so the volume is approximately 4π * 2 d dd.

But since dd is the change in distance, which is - (1/plx²) dplx as before. So substituting, the volume is 4π * 2 d * (-1/plx^2) dplx. But since d = 1/plx, this becomes 4π * 2 (1/plx) * (-1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but the volume can't be negative, so perhaps I should take the absolute value of dd. So the volume is 4π * 2 (1/plx) (1/plx²) dplx = 8π (1/plx^3) dplx.

Wait, so the number of stars in that shell is n * volume, so 8π n (1/plx^3) dplx. So the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^3. That would be option D.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results here. Earlier I thought it was 1/plx^4, but now I'm getting 1/plx^3.

Hmm. Maybe I messed up the substitution steps. Let's be more careful. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is 4π d² dr * n. So when d =
