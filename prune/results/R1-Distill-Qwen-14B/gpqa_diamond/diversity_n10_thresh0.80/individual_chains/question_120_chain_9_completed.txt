Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same throughout space. So, they don't cluster more in some areas than others. Now, the main point is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws: 1 over plx to the 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, which means that a larger parallax means a closer star. Oh wait no, wait: no, higher parallax means closer because nearby stars have larger parallaxes. Because the parallax formula is plx = 1/d (where d is in parsecs). Right.

So, the question is about the number of stars per unit plx. Let's think about this. If stars are uniformly distributed, does that mean that their number depends on how much volume a certain plx range corresponds to?

Wait, I remember that the number density of stars, n, is the same everywhere. So the number of stars in a certain volume would be n multiplied by that volume.

But since we're looking at parallax, which relates to distance, I need to think about how volume relates to plx. Let's see. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. But wait, when you're in 3D space, the volume element isn't just a simple function of d. Let me think: the volume between distance d and d + dd is the surface area at distance d (which is a sphere with radius d) multiplied by the thickness dd. So the volume element dV is 4πd² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, let's express d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx, and dd = -d² dplx (because plx is inversely proportional to d, so d increases as plx decreases). Wait, maybe I should change variables from d to plx.

So, let's set plx = 1/d. Then, d = 1/plx. The volume element dV in terms of plx would be the surface area at a certain plx multiplied by the change in distance. Wait, plx is in the denominator, so when plx increases (like from 1 to 2), d goes from 1 to 0.5, so the distance is decreasing. Wait, no: higher plx (like 2) means closer to us, so when plx increases, d decreases.

Wait, the volume element in terms of plx would be the surface area (4πd²) times the change in distance (dd). But from plx's point of view, dd is related to dplx. Since d=1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, plugging that in, dV =4πd² * dd =4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx² dplx) )? Wait, let's compute it more carefully.

dV = 4π d² dd

But since d = 1/plx, d² = 1/plx², and dd = (d dplx)/(d/dplx) ) Wait, maybe better to use substitution.

Alternatively, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

So, substituting into dV:

dV =4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx² dplx )

Wait, that gives dV = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the negative sign just tells us the direction of change, so when plx increases, d decreases. For the number of stars, we can ignore the negative sign as we're considering small increments.

So, dV =4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, no. Let me recheck the substitution. Let's compute dV in terms of plx.

So, let me think of dV as the volume between plx and plx + dplx. The volume is the integral from plx to plx + dplx of the surface area at each plx multiplied by the thickness in distance.

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to think about spherical shells. The volume between two plx values, plx and plx + dplx, is the volume of the sphere with radius 1/plx minus the sphere with radius 1/(plx + dplx).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because plx is 1/d, so the distance d is 1/plx. So if plx increases, the distance for the outer shell is smaller. That complicates things, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider a thin shell at a certain plx. The volume of the shell (dV) at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Now, plx = 1/d → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, dV = 4π d² * (-1/plx² dplx )

But d=1/plx → d² =1/plx².

So, substituting:

dV =4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx² dplx )

Which is:

dV = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx

Again, the negative sign is just about the direction, so the magnitude is 4π/(plx^4) dplx.

But since the density of stars is uniform, the number of stars in that volume is n * dV. So, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to dV, which is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking about the number of stars per unit range of plx (i.e., per dplx). So, for a small range dplx, the number of stars is n * dV, which is n*(4π/(plx^4) ) * dplx. So the number per unit plx is (n *4π) / plx^4.

But wait, the options given are just the dependence on plx. So the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A) ~ 1/plx^4, B) 1/plx^2, etc. So option A is 1 over plx to the fourth. So that's the conclusion.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think. The question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax". So perhaps it's the number of stars in a given plx interval (like plx to plx + dplx) per unit plx (dplx).

So, the number of stars is n * dV. And dV is proportional to 1/plx^4 dplx.

So the number per unit plx (dV per dplx) is (n *4π ) * (1/plx^4) dplx. So when you take the number per unit plx (dV), it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer would be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The number of stars in a certain range of plx would depend on the volume available for stars in that plx range.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is between the number per unit distance and per unit parallax.

Wait, another approach: the distance modulus. The flux from a star depends on its distance, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of solid angles. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a certain solid angle would be proportional to the solid angle and the depth along that direction.

Wait, maybe another approach is to think about how the number of stars observed with parallax between plx and plx + dplx varies with plx.

The number of stars N in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx would be the surface area of the shell (which is 4π (1/plx)^2 ) multiplied by the thickness in distance (which is the change in distance corresponding to the change in plx, which is (d d) = - (1/plx^2) dplx, but we take the absolute value) multiplied by the volume density of stars.

So N = n * (4π (1/plx)^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx )

Because the thickness in distance is (1/plx) - (1/(plx + dplx)) ≈ (d d) = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, but the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr, where r is the radius. Here, r is 1/plx, so dr = -(1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx² dplx) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars N is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number per unit plx (dplx) is (n *4π) / plx^4. So N per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which matches option A.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me see: when plx increases, the distance decreases, so each unit of plx corresponds to a smaller distance step. So the volume element (dV) is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the number of stars in that dV is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A) ~ 1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

The volume element \( dV \) between two distances \( d \) and \( d + dd \) is given by the surface area of a sphere at distance \( d \) multiplied by the thickness \( dd \):  
\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dd.
\]  
Expressing \( d \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we have \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), so \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the expression for \( dV \), we get:  
\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]  
The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but for our purposes, we are interested in the magnitude. Thus, the volume element in terms of \( \text{plx} \) is:  
\[
dV = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]  

Since the number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume, the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:  
**A) ~ \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \)**.
