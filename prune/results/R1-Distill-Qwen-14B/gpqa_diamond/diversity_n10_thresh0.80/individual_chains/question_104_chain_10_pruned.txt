Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, I guess. But wait, in this case, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so their masses are the same. So the difference must be due to something else.

The problem says both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. So the host stars are identical. The planets have similar masses, so their gravitational influence on the stars should be the same, right? But the Doppler shifts observed are different. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, while Planet #2 caused 7. Wait, so why is the shift different if the masses and star masses are the same?

Oh, I think it's because the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/ (P * (1/(2Ï€)) ) )^(1/3) ), but maybe there's an easier way.

Wait, another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But since the inclination i is the same for both (as they have circular orbits and we can assume edge-on, but I'm not sure if that's a given here), maybe the ratio of their velocities is what matters.

Alternatively, the formula for K is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Let me think of the simplified version. I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ) * something else. Alternatively, since the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, maybe we can ignore the M_p term because they're the same? Or maybe not, because sin i is same if both are edge-on, which I think the problem implies since the orbits are circular and we detected the shifts.

Wait, but both planets have the same mass, and the same star mass. So the only variable is the period. Hmm, but wait, the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star. So if the star is moving faster, the shift is larger. So K is larger when the star's velocity is higher.

The Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. So for the same star mass and planet mass, the velocity of the star (K) depends on the orbital period. I think the formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P * (1 - e^2)^(3/2))) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, but since the eccentricity e is zero for both (they are in circular orbits), that term is 1. Also, M_p is the same for both, M_star is same, so the only variable is the period P. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, let me get the formula right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) )

Hmm, but wait, let
