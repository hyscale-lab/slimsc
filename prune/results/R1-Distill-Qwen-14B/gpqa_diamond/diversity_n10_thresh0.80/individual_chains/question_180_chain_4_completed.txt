Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question involves an isolated system of particles with charges and calculating the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is: there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, 2e is double the elementary charge, right? So each has charge 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs, so that's 3.2e-19 C each. But wait, the problem says 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is at the center, and the others are arranged around it at a distance of 2 meters.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Oh right, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to bring the charges together from infinity. But since all charges are fixed except one, or wait, no, wait. Wait, the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P. So all 12 are the same distance from the central charge, but how are they arranged? Are they on a sphere around P?

Wait, but the problem says "constrained to stay at 2m from P." So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P, but their arrangement—like, are they all equally spaced on a sphere? Probably, because for minimum potential energy, you want the charges as spread out as possible, like in a regular shape. So maybe they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but I'm not sure about the exact arrangement. But wait, for the potential energy calculation, maybe the exact positions don't matter as much as the distances between each pair of charges.

Wait, no, because the potential energy of a system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Oh right, because the potential energy is a pairwise thing. So the total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs of (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij.

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so it's fixed. The other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the distance from each of the 12 to the central charge is 2 meters. But what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Since they're all at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other vary depending on their arrangement. But wait, the problem doesn't specify their mutual distances; it only says they're each 2m from P. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential due to the central charge and not the interactions among the 12 charges? That doesn't sound right.

Wait, no, the problem should include all contributions. But if the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other are free to move as long as they are 2m from P, then their mutual distances can vary. But what's the minimum energy? Oh wait, minimum energy would correspond to the most stable configuration, which is when the potential energy is minimized. But for like charges, the potential energy between them is positive because like charges repel. So to minimize the total potential energy, you'd arrange them so that their mutual repulsion is minimized. Wait, no, wait: for positive charges, the potential energy between them is positive because each pair contributes a positive value. So the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of all these positive terms. Wait, but wait: if the charges are positive, bringing them closer would increase the potential energy. Wait no, wait: the potential energy between two positive charges increases as they get closer because you have to do work against their repulsion. So the potential energy is positive and becomes larger as the distance decreases.

Wait, but in this problem, the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not fixed. So to find the minimum potential energy, you would arrange them as far apart as possible, to minimize the sum of their mutual potential energies. Because each pair of these 12 charges contributes (k * (2e)^2) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j. So to minimize the sum, you want each r_ij as large as possible. But wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their mutual positions can vary as long as they are on the sphere of radius 2m. So the minimum energy would be when the mutual potential energies are as small as possible, which would happen when the charges are as far apart as possible. But wait, when you have multiple charges on a sphere, the maximum distance between any two would be the diameter, which is 4m, but they can't all be at 4m from each other because they're on a sphere. So the minimal sum of mutual potential energies would be achieved when the charges are as spread out as possible, like equally spaced points on the sphere.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy due to the central charge and the 12 charges, not their mutual interactions. Oh wait, but that can't be right because the question is about the minimum energy of the entire system, which includes all interactions.

Wait, maybe the problem is simplifying things by considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge. Because their mutual interactions might be considered negligible or perhaps the problem is designed that way. Let me read the problem again.

The problem states: "What is the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals?" So perhaps the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges with the central charge. Because the 12 charges are identical and each is at 2m from P, their potential energies would each be (k * q1 * q2) / r. So each would contribute (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). Then sum for all 12.

Wait, but wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so each of the 12 charges at 2m away would have a potential energy with respect to the central charge. But also, each of the 12 charges has a potential due to the other 11, so their mutual interactions contribute as well. So the total potential energy U is the sum of the interactions between the central charge and the others, plus the interactions between the 12 others.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy", so perhaps it's the minimum possible potential energy. But if the 12 charges are identical and positive, arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the sum of their mutual potential energies because each pair's potential energy is positive and would be smallest when the charges are as far apart as possible. So the most spread out configuration would give the minimal mutual potential energy. So perhaps in that case, the mutual potential energies sum up to a certain minimum.

But then, the question is whether the problem expects us to calculate just the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, or also their mutual interactions. The problem says "the minimum energy of this system", so I think all interactions must be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies are negligible, but that's unlikely because each of the 12 charges is 2e and the distance between them would be, say, 2m. Let's compute what that would be.

So first, let's compute the potential energy contributed by each of the 12 charges with the central charge. Each has charge 2e, and the distance is 2 meters.

The potential energy for each pair is U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m). Since k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the central charge is U_i = k*(2e)^2 / (2m). So 12 of these would be 12 * [ (k * 4e²) / (2*2) ] ?

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute each term correctly.

Each charge is 2e, so the product q_i q_j is (2e)(2e) = 4e².

The distance between the central charge and each of the 12 is 2m.

So each of the 12 interactions contributes (k * 4e²) / (2m). So per pair, it's (k *4e²)/(2m). Since there are 12 such pairs, the total for these interactions is 12 * (k *4e²)/(2m).

Simplify that: (12 * 4 * k * e² ) / (2 * m) ) = (48 k e²) / (2m) = 24 k e² / m.

Wait, but wait: 12 * (k *4e²)/2m. So 12 * (4k e²)/(2m) )= 12 * (2 k e²) / m. So 24 k e² / m.

Hmm, but then what about the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges? Each pair among the 12 charges contributes (k * (2e)^2)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two of those charges. Since all 12 are on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two can vary. But to find the minimal potential energy, we need to arrange them so that the sum of all mutual potentials is as small as possible.

Wait a minute, but wait: the mutual potential between two positive charges is positive, so the sum of all mutual potentials would be a positive number. To minimize the total energy, which includes both the central charge interactions and the mutual interactions, we need to minimize the sum.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps I should think about the potential energy due to all pairs. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, perhaps because they are constrained to 2m from P, but their mutual distances are fixed. But I don't think that's the case. The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their mutual distances can vary as long as each is 2m from P.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m around P. The mutual distance between any two on the sphere can be as small as possible (if they are close together) or as large as possible (diameter, 4m apart). But for the potential energy between them, since they repel, the potential energy is positive and increases as they get closer. So to minimize the total potential energy, the sum of all mutual potentials would be minimized when the charges are as spread out as possible, maximizing each r_ij. So the configuration with the maximum possible minimal distance between any two charges would give the lowest mutual potential energy.

Wait, but actually, if the charges are placed as far apart as possible on the sphere, then each pair's potential energy is as small as possible (since r is large), thus their sum is minimized. So for the 12 charges on a sphere, the configuration that minimizes the sum of mutual potentials is when they are equally spaced, i.e., forming a regular icosahedron or something similar. But wait, 12 points on a sphere would correspond to an icosahedron arrangement, but I'm not exactly sure. But in any case, the exact calculation of the mutual potential energies would require knowing each r_ij between all pairs, which seems complicated.

But perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions, and only consider the potential between each of the 12 and the central charge. That would make the problem solvable. Let me see: if that's the case, then the total potential energy is 12 times the potential energy between the central charge and one of the others.

So each interaction would be U_i = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) = (k * 4e²) / (2m) = (2 k e²) / m per charge.

But wait, no, wait: 2e is the charge, so q_i is 2e, and the central charge is also 2e, so each pair (central and 12 others) contributes (k * (2e)^2) / (2m) = (k *4e²)/(2m) = (2 k e²)/m per pair.

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total U_central = 12 * (2 k e²) / m = 24 k e² / m.

But then, what about the mutual potential between the 12 charges? Let's compute that as a separate term.

The mutual potential among 12 identical charges arranged on a sphere would be the sum over all pairs. The number of pairs among 12 charges is C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes (k * (2e)^2) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

But if all the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, then the average distance between any two would be the same. Wait, but no, that's not the case. For a regular polyhedron, like a regular icosahedron with 12 vertices, the distances between vertices vary, but perhaps for an approximate calculation, we can take the average distance or use a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the mutual interactions as zero, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are negligible compared to the central charge interactions. Let me compute the values to see which is the case.

First, let's compute U_central.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.6e-19 C.

m = 2 meters.

So U_central = 24 * k * e² / m.

Compute e²: (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So U_central = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 / 2.

Wait, 24 times 8.988e9 is approximately 24 * 8.988e9 ≈ 215.712e9.

Multiply by 2.56e-38: 215.712e9 * 2.56e-38 = 215.712 * 2.56e-29.

215.712 * 2.56 ≈ 552. So 552e-29 = 5.52e-26.

Divide by 2 (because m=2): 5.52e-26 / 2 = 2.76e-26 J.

Wait, but wait: the calculation:

U_central = 24 * (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (1.6e-19 C)^2 / (2 m)

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Compute (2e)^2: (2 *1.6e-19)^2 = (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

Each pair with the central charge contributes (k * (2e)^2) / 2m = (8.988e9 * 10.24e-38) / 2.

Compute 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 8.988 *10.24 * 1e9 *1e-38 = 92.167 * 1e-29 = 9.2167e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.60835e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 4.60835e-28 *12 = 5.530e-27 J.

Wait, wait, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, let me recompute:

Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy with the central charge of U_i = k*(2e)^2 / r.

So (2e) is 3.2e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

So for each U_i, 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 / 2 (because r=2m).

Compute 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 8.988 *10.24 = approx 92.167, times 1e9 *1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 92.167e-29 = 9.2167e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.60835e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12 charges: 4.60835e-28 *12 = 5.53002e-27 J.

So U_central is approximately 5.53e-27 J.

Now, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Let's think about this.

Each pair of the 12 charges contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

The number of pairs is C(12,2) = 66.

Assuming that on average, the distance r_ij is 2m, which might not be the case, but perhaps the problem expects that. Wait, but for 12 points on a sphere, the average distance between pairs is less than 2m * 2 (diameter is 4m), but perhaps for simplicity, the problem assumes that each pair is at 2m. But that's not correct, because if all 12 are on a sphere of radius 2m, their mutual distances would vary. But perhaps the problem is making an approximation, or perhaps it expects us to ignore the mutual interactions.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the mutual potential would be significant. Let me compute it assuming that each pair is at 2m. So each mutual pair's potential energy would be U_ij = k*(2e)^2/(2m) = same as the central charge interaction, which is 4.608e-28 J per pair.

So for 66 pairs, the mutual potential would be 66 *4.608e-28 = let's compute that.

66 *4.608e-28 = approximately 304.0e-28 J = 3.04e-26 J.

So the total potential energy would be U_central + U_mutual = 5.53e-27 + 3.04e-26 = approx 3.59e-26 J.

But wait, the options given are A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Hmm, 3.59e-26 is not among the options. So perhaps the mutual interactions are being ignored. Let's check what happens if we only consider the central charge contributions.

In that case, the total U would be 5.53e-27 J, which is approximately 5.53e-27 J. But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is close but not exactly the same.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let's recompute U_central accurately.

Compute U_central accurately.

Each of the 12 charges has a potential energy with the central charge of (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m).

Let me compute this accurately.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So (2e) = 3.204e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.2657e-38 C².

So per pair, (k * (2e)^2) / (2m) = (8.988e9 * 10.2657e-38) / (2 * 2).

Wait, wait: 8.988e9 * 10.2657e-38 = 8.988 *10.2657 * 1e9 *1e-38 = 92.445 * 1e-29 = 9.2445e-28.

Divide by (2m) which is 4m? Wait no, m is 2m, so denominator is 2m=2*2=4? Wait, no, wait, the denominator is r, which is 2m, so 2m is 2 * 2 m? No, wait no, r is 2 meters. So denominator is 2 meters. So each term is (8.988e9 * 10.2657e-38) / 2.

Wait, no, the denominator is 2, because r is 2m. So:

Compute 8.988e9 * 10.2657e-38 = 8.988 *10.2657 = approx 92.445 → 92.445e-29 = 9.2445e-28.

Divide by 2: 9.2445e-28 /2 = 4.62225e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.62225e-28 *12 = 5.5467e-27 J.

So U_central is approximately 5.547e-27 J.

But that's about 5.55e-27 J. None of the options match that, but option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let's see: the central charge is fixed, and each of the 12 charges is at 2m from it. So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k * (2e)^2 )/(2m). So 12 terms, each 4.62225e-28, sum to 5.5467e-27 J.

But perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2m from each other as well, which would be the case if they are all at the same point, but that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges form a regular dodecahedron, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual interactions, which would make the total energy U = 5.547e-27 J, close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly.

Wait, option B is 2.822e-26, which is 5.547e-27 multiplied by about 5. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering each charge as interacting with the central charge once. Wait, but each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge once, so 12 terms.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the central charge. So perhaps the central charge's potential energy is calculated as the sum of all interactions with the 12 charges, so 12 terms. So that's correct.

But then, perhaps the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are to be considered, but the problem expects us to find the minimal energy, which would be when the mutual potential energies are as small as possible. Wait, but as I thought earlier, for positive charges, their mutual potential energies are positive, so to minimize the total, you would arrange them as far apart as possible, thus making each r_ij as large as possible to minimize the sum of (1/r_ij). But in reality, on a sphere, the maximum minimum r_ij is when the charges are equally spaced, forming a regular polyhedron.

But without knowing the exact distances, perhaps the problem is neglecting the mutual interactions, expecting us to compute only the potential due to the central charge.

If that's the case, then the total energy is approximately 5.547e-27 J, which is 5.547e-27. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is not too far off, but perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the U_central with precise values.

Let me recompute U_central accurately.

U_central = 12 * [ (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m = 2 meters.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19 C)^2 = (3.204)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 10.2657 * 1e-38 = 1.02657e-37 C².

Each term: (8.988e9) * (1.02657e-37) / (2 * 2) → because r = 2m.

Wait, denominator is 2 meters.

So (8.988e9) * (1.02657e-37) = 8.988 * 1.02657 = approx 9.244e-28.

Divide by 2: 9.244e-28 / 2 = 4.622e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 4.622e-28 *12 = 5.546e-27 J.

So U_central is 5.546e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher than this value. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider each pair between the 12 charges and the central charge twice, but no, each charge interacts with the central charge once. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute (2e)^2 again.

(2e) = 3.204e-19 C.

(3.204e-19)^2 = 10.2657e-38 C² = 1.02657e-37 C².

So 8.988e9 * 1.02657e-37 = 8.988e9 * 1.02657e-37 = (8.988 *1.02657) * 1e-28.

8.988 *1.02657 ≈ 9.244 → 9.244e-28.

Divide by 2 (the 2m denominator) → 4.622e-28 per charge.

12 * 4.622e-28 = 5.546e-27 J.

Hmm.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the 13th charge is fixed at P, and that the 12 are fixed at 2m from P. So perhaps the potential energy is only that between the central charge and the 12 others, and the mutual interactions are zero. But that doesn't make sense because the mutual interactions would be present.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges to be at a distance of 2m from each other, but that would only happen if they are all at the same point, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular hexagon or some other structure where the mutual distances are known, but I don't think that's given in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the potential energy due to the central charge, and not the mutual interactions. Let's assume that for a moment.

So the total energy would be U_central =5.546e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the value again.

Wait, perhaps the charges are 2e, but what about the sign? The problem says each has charge 2e. Since e is positive, all are positive. So they repel each other. So the mutual potential energies are positive.

But if the problem is considering that the mutual potential energies are the same as the central charge contributions, perhaps the mutual energy is 66 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), which is 66 *4.622e-28 = 3.047e-26 J.

Adding that to the U_central of 5.546e-27 J gives 3.59e-26 J + 5.546e-27 J = 4.14e-26 J, which doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions, thus the answer would be U_central =5.546e-27 J. The closest option is option C, 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thing: perhaps the charges are 2e, but arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2m from the central charge, but the mutual distances are 2m as well. That is, all the 12 charges are 2m apart from each other. But that's impossible on a sphere of radius 2m because the maximum distance between any two points on the sphere is 4m.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m, but their mutual distances are 2m as well. That would imply that the points are arranged in a regular polyhedron where each edge is 2m. For example, perhaps a regular tetrahedron, but with 12 points, maybe an icosahedron. But regardless, the mutual distance would not be 2m in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 2m, so each pair of the 12 charges is 2m apart. But that would require all 12 charges to be arranged on a sphere of radius 1m, because if two points are 2m apart on a sphere, the radius must be 1m (since the diameter is 2m). But the problem states that the 12 are at 2m from P, so that can't be. So this approach is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem asks for the minimum energy. The minimum could be when the mutual potential energies are minimized, which would be when the charges are as far apart as possible. So perhaps each pair of the 12 charges is at 4m apart (diametrically opposite points on the sphere), but that's only possible if all charges are at opposite ends, which isn't feasible for 12 charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are zero, but that's only possible if charges are negative, but the problem states they are positive.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to calculate only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others. Then the answer would be approximately 5.546e-27 J, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the charge is 2e, but I used 3.2e-19 C. Let me check that. e is 1.6e-19 C, so 2e is 3.2e-19 C, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the potential energy using the formula U = (1/(4πε0)) * (q1 q2)/r. So k is 1/(4πε0) =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recompute:

(2e)² = (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 = 1.024e-37.

k * (2e)^2 = 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = 9.2167e-28.

Divide by r=2m: 9.2167e-28 / 2 =4.60835e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 5.53002e-27 J.

Hmm. So again, about 5.53e-27 J.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2m from P, but arranged in such a way that each is at the same point as the central charge, but that's impossible because then they would all be on top of it, which would make r_ij negligible, leading to extremely high potential energies. That can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energies and only consider the central charge interactions. So the minimal energy would be approximately 5.53e-27 J, but that isn't an option. The closest option is option C, 7.056e-27 J, which is about 27% higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in charge calculation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the central charge's potential energy twice, once as q_i and once as q_j. But no, each pair is counted once. So perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the central charge.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total potential energy as the sum of all possible pairs, including the central charge and the 12 others, and the mutual pairs among the 12.

So the total U is U_central + U_mutual.

We calculated U_central as 5.546e-27 J.

U_mutual is 66 * (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij_avg.

But without knowing r_ij_avg, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that all mutual distances are 2m. Then U_mutual would be 66 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 66 * (8.988e9 * 4e²)/(2 *2).

Wait, let me compute that.

(2e)^2 is 4e², but wait, e is 1.6e-19, so (2e)^2 is 4*(1.6e-19)^2 = 4*2.56e-38 = 1.024e-37 C².

So U_mutual per pair is (8.988e9 * 1.024e-37) / (2 * 2) = (9.216e-28) / 4 = 2.304e-28 J per mutual pair.

Multiply by 66: 66 * 2.304e-28 = 1.519e-26 J.

Adding U_central: 5.546e-27 +1.519e-26 = 2.0736e-26 J, which is approximately 2.07e-26 J. The closest option is option B: 2.822e-26, which is about 35% higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential is calculated with r_ij = 2m, which would give each mutual pair U_ij = (k*(2e)^2)/2 = 4.608e-28 J. So 66 pairs contribute 66*4.608e-28 = 3.04e-26 J.

Total U = U_central (5.546e-27) + mutual (3.04e-26) = 3.595e-26 J. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential is being ignored because the problem states that the 12 charges are at a fixed distance from P, and their mutual distances are not varying, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions, and the answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J. But that's about 5.5e-27 * 1.28, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of U_central. Let's compute it again.

U_central = 12 * [ (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m) ]

k =8.988e9, (2e)^2= (3.2e-19)^2=1.024e-37.

So each term is (8.988e9 * 1.024e-37) / (2 *2) → because r=2m.

Wait, no. The denominator is r=2m, so per term: (8.988e9) * (1.024e-37) / 2.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = 9.216e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.608e-28 per charge.

Multiply by 12: 5.53e-27 J.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about five times larger than U_central. Maybe I missed a factor of 5 somewhere. How?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. If the 12 charges are each interacting with the central charge, it's 12 terms, each contributing U = (k * (2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, but perhaps the formula is (k * q1 * q2)/r, and since the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e, each term is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4e² k)/(2m) = 2e² k/m.

So for each of the 12, it's 2e² k /m.

So for 12, it's 24 e² k / m.

Wait, let me compute that.

24 * e² * k / m.

e =1.6e-19, e²=2.56e-38.

k=8.988e9, m=2.

So 24 * (2.56e-38) * (8.988e9) / 2.

Compute 24 * 2.56e-38 =61.44e-38 =6.144e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 6.144e-37 * 8.988e9 = approx 55.22e-28 = 5.522e-27.

Divide by 2: 2.761e-27 J.

Wait, that's different from before. So U_central would be 2.76e-27 J.

But earlier, I thought it was 5.53e-27 J. Now this approach is giving me 2.76e-27 J.

Wait, why the discrepancy? Oh! Because I think I confused the number of terms. Each of the 12 charges is interacting with the central charge once, so 12 terms. So:

U_central = 12 * [ (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2m) ].

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as U_central = (k * (2e) * sum of all other charges) / r.

Sum of other charges is 12 * 2e =24e.

So U_central = k * (2e) * (24e) / (2m).

Which is k * 2e * 24e / (2m) = k * (48 e²) / (2m) ) = k *24 e² / m.

Wait, that makes sense.

So U_central = (8.988e9) * (24 * (1.6e-19)^2) / 2.

Compute 24*(1.6e-19)^2 =24*(2.56e-38)=61.44e-38=6.144e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 6.144e-37 *8.988e9 = 55.22e-28 =5.522e-27.

Divide by 2: 2.761e-27 J.

Wait, so U_central is 2.76e-27 J.

But that's different from the previous calculation. Hmm. So which is correct?

Ah! I think I see the mistake. Earlier, I considered each of the 12 charges contributing U_i = (k * (2e)^2 )/(2m). Which would be correct. But when I tried to compute it as U_central = k * (2e) * (sum of 12*(2e)) / (2m), that's wrong because the sum would be 12*(2e) =24e, but the formula is U = k * (q1 * q2)/r, where q2 is the sum of the other charges. Wait, no. That's correct because the central charge is fixed, and each of the 12 is a point charge. Alternatively, the total potential energy is the sum over all pairs between the central charge and the 12 others. So U_central = sum_{i=1 to 12} [ k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) ) ] = 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)] = 12 * [2 k e²/(m)].

Wait, that's the same as before, giving 5.53e-27 J.

So I think the correct approach is the first one, giving U_central =5.53e-27 J.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider only the mutual potential energies, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as a single point charge located at the center. Wait, no, the 12 are each at 2m from P, so they are on a sphere around P.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum potential energy, which would be when the system is as stable as possible, meaning the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual repulsion is minimized. Which would be when they are as spread out as possible. But without knowing the exact distances, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the mutual interactions.

In that case, the answer would be approximately 5.53e-27 J, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is referring to the potential energy per charge, but that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to compute the potential energy as (12 choose 2) * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)]. So each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), but this would give a much larger value.

Wait, (12 choose 2) is 66. So 66 * (8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 )/(2 *2).

Compute (3.2e-19)^2 =1.024e-37.

So 66 * (8.988e9 * 1.024e-37) /4.

Compute 8.988e9 *1.024e-37 =9.216e-28.

Divide by4: 2.304e-28.

Multiply by 66: 1.518e-26 J.

But adding that to the U_central of 5.53e-27 J gives 1.518e-26 +5.53e-27 =2.07e-26 J. Still no matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting only the U_mutual, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Option A:5.645e-26 → 5.6e-26.

Option B:2.822e-26 → 2.8e-26.

Option C:7.056e-27 →7.0e-27.

Option D:122.330 → way bigger.

Wait, the U_central I calculated was approximately5.53e-27 J. So option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher.

Hmm. Maybe I should recheck the calculation one more time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, such as 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let's see:

Using k=9e9.

U_central =12 * [ (9e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 ] / (2 *2).

(3.2e-19)^2=1.024e-37.

So 9e9 * 1.024e-37 =9.216e-28.

Divide by 4: 2.304e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.7648e-27 J.

That's about2.76e-27 J, which is close to option B's 2.82e-26 J, but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as twice what I calculated. For example, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including both the central charge and the mutual interactions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for gravitational potential energy, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 charges arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2m from the others as well as from the central charge, but that's impossible, as earlier discussed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are at a distance of 2m from each other as well, but that would require a very tight arrangement, which isn't possible.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the problem is intended to have the potential energy calculated as the sum of the central charge interactions and the mutual interactions, but the mutual interactions are calculated assuming a regular tetrahedron-like arrangement, giving a specific average distance.

But without specific information, this approach is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions, leading to the U_central being 5.54e-27 J. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point as the central charge, but that would make r=0, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the charges are 2e, but the central charge is fixed, so the 12 others are each 2e, but the central is 2e as well. So when calculating the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the central charge as fixed and not contributing to the potential energy, but that's not correct because the central charge contributes to the potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 charges arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2m from the central charge and from each other, which is impossible, so perhaps the problem is flawed.

Given all that, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate only the central charge interactions, leading to U_central =5.53e-27 J, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the formula U = (k * q1 * q2)/r, and considering that each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge once. So 12 terms, each (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So, 12 * (8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 )/(2 *2).

Compute (3.2e-19)^2 = 1.024e-37.

So, 8.988e9 *1.024e-37 =9.216e-28.

Divide by 4 (since denominator is 2m): 2.304e-28 per term.

Multiply by 12: 2.7648e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.76e-27 J. The closest option is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is about 2.5 times larger.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents.

Wait, let me compute it step by step again:

(2e) =3.2e-19 C.

(2e)^2=10.24e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

r=2m.

Each term: (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / (2*2) = (8.988e9 *10.24e-38) /4.

Compute 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =9.216e-28.

Divide by 4: 2.304e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.7648e-27 J.

So, U_central is 2.76e-27 J.

But option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, wait, wait. (2e) is 3.2e-19 C. So (2e)^2 is (3.2e-19)^2 =10.24e-38 C². Correct.

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Each term: (8.988e9 *10.24e-38) / (2*2) = (9.216e-28) /4 =2.304e-28.

Multiply by 12:2.7648e-27 J.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each pair contributes twice, once as q1 and once as q2, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to calculate the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the central charge, and mutual pairs, but I'm not sure.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps the problem expects me to choose the closest option, which would be option C:7.056e-27 J, but that's about 2.5 times larger than 2.76e-27 J.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 24 instead of 12. Let me see.

If U_central =24 * [k*(2e)^2)/(2m)].

Wait, 24 * [ (8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 ) /4 ].

So 24 * 2.304e-28 =5.5296e-27 J.

But that's back to the initial calculation.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26 J. But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation with more precise numbers.

Let me compute using more precise values:

k=8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602176634e-19 C.

So (2e) =3.204353268e-19 C.

(2e)^2= (3.204353268e-19)^2=10.2653603e-38 C².

r=2m.

Each term: (8.9875517879e9) * (10.2653603e-38) / (2 * 2) = (8.9875517879e9 *10.2653603e-38) /4.

Compute 8.9875517879e9 *10.2653603e-38:

= (8.9875517879 *10.2653603) * 1e9 *1e-38

= 92.444556 * 1e-29

=9.2444556e-28.

Divide by4: 9.2444556e-28 /4 =2.3111139e-28.

Multiply by12: 2.3111139e-28 *12 =2.77333668e-27 J.

So U_central =2.773e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27 J, but that's about 2.5 times larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the sum of all pairs, including the mutual interactions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy with the central charge, and the mutual interactions. But without knowing the exact distances, it's hard to compute.

Given all that, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26 J. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, let me compute 2.773e-27 J *10 ≈ 2.77e-26, which is close to option B:2.822e-26.

But why would I multiply by 10? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of charges. Let me recheck: there are 12 charges, each interacting with the central charge once.

Wait, perhaps I should compute U_central as 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), which is 12 * (8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 )/(2*2).

Which is 12 * (8.988e9 *10.24e-38 )/4.

Compute 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =9.216e-28.

Divide by4:2.304e-28.

Multiply by12: 2.7648e-27 J.

So I'm back to the same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the energy in a different unit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me check:

(2e) is 3.2e-19 C.

(2e)^2 is 10.24e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

r=2m.

Each term: (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) = 9.216e-28.

Divide by 2m=2: 4.608e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.53e-27 J.

Hmm. So I think the correct answer is approximately 5.53e-27 J, but none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only the mutual potential energies, leading to a larger value.

But without further information, I'm not sure. Given that, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the calculations I've done. The closest option to my U_central calculation is none, but perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.

But wait, 7.056e-27 is 2.76e-27 multiplied by approximately 2.56. Which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement: the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the central charge, and the mutual distances are such that the potential energy is zero. But that's not possible because like charges have positive potential energies.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to go with the calculation I did earlier, which gives U_central=5.53e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, considering some factor I missed.

After much deliberation, I think the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26 J. But I'm not entirely sure.


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a central charge fixed at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system includes contributions from the interactions between the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, as well as the mutual interactions between the 12 surrounding charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Between the Central Charge and the 12 Surrounding Charges**:
   - Each surrounding charge interacts with the central charge with a potential energy given by:
     \[
     U_{\text{central}} = \frac{k \cdot (2e)^2}{r}
     \]
     where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).
   - Substituting \( (2e)^2 = (3.2 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 1.024 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{C}^2 \), the potential energy for one pair is:
     \[
     U_{\text{central, single}} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 1.024 \times 10^{-37}}{2} = 4.608 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - Since there are 12 such charges, the total contribution is:
     \[
     U_{\text{central, total}} = 12 \cdot 4.608 \times 10^{-28} = 5.53 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Surrounding Charges**:
   - The mutual potential energy between each pair of surrounding charges is given by:
     \[
     U_{\text{mutual, single}} = \frac{k \cdot (2e)^2}{r_{\text{mutual}}}
     \]
     where \( r_{\text{mutual}} \) is the distance between two surrounding charges.
   - The problem does not specify the exact arrangement of the 12 charges, but to minimize the total potential energy, the charges should be spread out as much as possible. Assuming the charges are equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 m, the average distance \( r_{\text{mutual}} \) can be approximated. However, without explicit information, the mutual potential energy is difficult to compute precisely.

3. **Total Potential Energy**:
   - The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the contributions from the central charge interactions and the mutual interactions:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{central, total}} + U_{\text{mutual, total}}
     \]
   - If the mutual interactions are ignored (as the problem may implicitly assume), the total energy is approximately:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} \approx 5.53 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - This value does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, if the mutual interactions are considered, the total energy would be larger, as the mutual potential energy is positive.

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - **Option A (\( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \))**: This is significantly larger than the calculated \( U_{\text{central, total}} \) and is inconsistent with the problem setup.
   - **Option B (\( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \))**: This is approximately 5 times larger than the calculated \( U_{\text{central, total}} \). It could represent the total energy if mutual interactions are included but does not align with the calculations.
   - **Option C (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \))**: This is about 27% larger than \( U_{\text{central, total}} \). It might reflect an approximation or rounding in the problem setup.
   - **Option D (\( 122.330 \))**: This is orders of magnitude larger and clearly incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible answer, based on the calculations and the provided options, is **Option B (\( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \))**, as it accounts for both the central charge interactions and the mutual interactions, even though the exact derivation is unclear.

ANSWER: B
