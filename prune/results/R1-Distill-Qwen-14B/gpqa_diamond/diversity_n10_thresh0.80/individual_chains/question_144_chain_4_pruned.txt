Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance decay, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the decay length is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think goes something like decay length L = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the lifetime, and β is the velocity relative to the speed of light (so β = v/c).

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the particle's width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should be careful with the units here.

Wait, Γ is the decay width, which is an energy quantity. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure all units are compatible. Also, I think that when using natural units, ħ is in units of GeV·s, but I might need to do some unit conversions.

So let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity β of the meson. For that, I think I can use the energy and mass. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But since E is given in GeV and m is also in GeV/c², maybe it's easier to work in units where c=1, but I'll have to be cautious with units.

Wait, the meson's total energy is E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV/c². So the energy is higher than the rest mass, meaning it's moving relativistically.

The relativistic energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for pc: pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ). Then, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) /
