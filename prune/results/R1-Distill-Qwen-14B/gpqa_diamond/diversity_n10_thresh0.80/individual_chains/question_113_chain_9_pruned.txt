Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to all this. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I'll need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It says there's a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad. Carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H stretch, whereas alcohols have a less broad one. But maybe it's an alcohol.

Then, two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong peak, which makes me think of carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ester or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl? Or maybe it's an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not. Another thought: if it's a carbonyl and another peak nearby, maybe it's an ester or a ketone with some conjugation.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, so the compound probably has a double bond, like an alkene. Maybe it's part of an aromatic ring or an isolated double bond.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for a fragment. Let me think about what gives m/z=45. Maybe a CH3CO+ ion (acetone would give that), but wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which would have molecular weight around 58. Alternatively, another possibility is the fragment could be a ketone group or an aldehyde group. Or maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B
