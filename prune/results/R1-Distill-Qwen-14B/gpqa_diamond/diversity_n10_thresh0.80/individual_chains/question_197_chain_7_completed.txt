Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy stuff yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, specifically for anti-Markovnikov addition. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! When you have an alkene reacting with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it's actually a way to do a Markovnikov addition. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydroxy iodide method, right? No, wait. OH, wait another thought: when you have an alkene reacting with HI in the presence of a red phosphorus, it's for the addition of HI in anti-Markovnikov fashion. Or wait, no—red phosphorus is used in the hydroboration-oxidation maybe? No, that's with BH3. Hmm. Wait, I think that the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is called the oxymercuration? No, oxymercuration uses Hg(OAc)2 and then something else. Oh wait, maybe that's the other way around. Alternatively, I think when you use red phosphorus and HI, it's for the hydroiodination of alkenes, adding HI across the double bond. And the way it adds is that the iodide adds to the less substituted carbon because it's a radical mechanism? Or wait, maybe it's a ionic mechanism. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, I think the reaction of alkenes with HI and red phosphorus leads to the formation of an iodoalkane, but the addition is such that the iodide ends up on the less substituted carbon. Because it's a type of acid-catalyzed addition, maybe? Or perhaps it's a radical addition where the hydrogen abstracts from the more substituted carbon. So, it's a anti-Markovnikov addition. So, the H adds to the more substituted carbon, and the I to the less substituted.

So, the first thing I need to do is figure out what the structure of Compound X is. Because once I have that, I can predict what the product would look like after reacting with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the spectroscopic data provided:

IR: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H stretch. The 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be aromatic C=C stretching.

The 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's probably an aldehyde proton or an acidic proton. But wait, aldehyde is usually around 9-10 ppm. But maybe it's an aromatic proton? No, aromatic protons are lower. Wait, a broad singlet at 10.5 could be an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have O-H protons around 10-12 ppm, and they are broad.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The IR has a peak at 1720, which is around where a carbonyl would be. For a carboxylic acid, that would be the C=O stretch. Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone. But if there's an O-H stretch (from 3400–2500), that's broad—so maybe a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the NMR: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So, we have a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. Wait, wait, but two doublets each integrating to 2H—so probably a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are meta? No, no, because for para substitution, the protons would be as two doublets. Let me think. If it's a para-substituted benzene, each of the two protons adjacent to the substituent would be a doublet. Wait, no. For example, in para-xylene, the aromatic protons are all equivalent, but that's not the case here. Wait, the 8.0 and 7.2 each have 2H, so maybe the ring has two substituents that are in para positions, but each has two protons. Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents in para positions. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a substituent in the para position, and another group attached. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, each with a group. Or maybe it's a meta substitution. Wait, but the two doublets with 2H each suggest that there are two sets of two equivalent protons. So, perhaps the substituents are in the para position, and each substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, causing the adjacent protons to split into two doublets.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Suppose the benzene has a substituent in the para position. For example, if the substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or a carboxylic acid), the ring would have two substituents. Or wait, perhaps it's a single substituent in the para position. No, wait. Let me consider the substituents.

Wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is probably a methyl group next to another CH group. Like in an isopropyl group, but wait, 1.4 is a methyl adjacent to a CH in an isopropyl group. Or maybe it's a CH2CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, looking at all the NMR signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): possible O-H or aldehyde.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): methyl group, possibly adjacent to a CH group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal methyl, like an ethyl group.

So, putting this together: perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a ketone or a carboxylic acid, and an ethyl or isopropyl group attached.

Wait, so the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So possible groups: ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The O-H in the IR (3400–2500) is broad, which suggests it's a carboxylic acid. Because aldehydes have a sharp peak around 2800-2700 (stretch for the C-H in aldehyde), but the broad peak here is more likely a carboxylic O-H.

So if there's a carboxylic acid group, that would explain the 10.5 ppm peak as the -OH proton. So the structure might be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

Looking at the NMR again, we have two doublets in the aromatic region: 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. So perhaps the benzene is para-substituted with a carboxylic acid group and another group, like an isopropyl or ethyl group.

Wait, but the 1H NMR also has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3 group (ethyl). The triplet suggests it's at the end of a chain, like a CH2CH3.

Then there's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), which could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to another CH and perhaps a carbonyl.

Looking at the coupling, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the ring. Wait, here's a thought: perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a CH2CH(CH3)COOH group. Or wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a carbonyl somewhere.

Alternatively, think of the substituent as a -CH2-COOH group. But wait, the NMR doesn't show peaks that would correspond to that.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The IR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and the aromatic ring (C=C). So the degrees of unsaturation would be 4 (aromatic ring is 3, carbonyl is 1, but perhaps some other double bonds or rings?).

Looking at the NMR, the substituents are probably a benzene ring with a side chain. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent that is a -CH2-COOH group. Then the NMR would show the -CH2- as a triplet, but wait, in that case, the 1.7 ppm would be the CH2 next to the COOH. The 2.9 ppm would be the CH next to the COOH. But then, where would the 1.4 and 0.9 ppm signals come from? Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Wait, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: looking for a peak at 0.9 ppm, which is a triplet, so that's probably a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which is a methyl group adjacent to a CH. So that's a typical isopropyl group: CH(CH3)2. Wait, but an isopropyl group's CH would be around 1.4 ppm as a septet, but in our case, it's a doublet. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2CH(CH3) group, which is part of a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. For example, the benzene has a CH2CH(CH3)COOH group.

Wait, let me think again. The IR indicates a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure has a -COOH group. The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which would be the -OH proton. Then the aromatic protons are in two doublets, so the substituent is in the para position relative to the -COOH.

So, the substituent would be in the para position. So the benzene is 4-substituted with a -COOH group. The other substituent is the one causing the other signals.

Now, looking at the other NMR signals:

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H): perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m,2H): likely a CH2 group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl adjacent to a CH (like isopropyl group).

0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that doesn't immediately make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group, but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)COOH group. No, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, but that would be an isopropyl group. But the signals don't exactly fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group, but that might not explain all the peaks.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making a longer chain. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(propyl)benzoic acid. Let me see: the benzoic acid would have the -COOH group at the para position. The substituent is a propyl group. So the substituent would be -CH2CH2CH3. But in that case, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2CH3, which is at 0.9 ppm, and a quartet for the adjacent CH2. But in the given data, the triplet is 3H (0.9 ppm), which fits the CH2CH3. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the middle CH2 in the propyl chain. Then the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) must be another group; maybe an adjacent CH. Hmm, but that doesn't fit a straight propyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the structure would be something like:

Ph-COOH, and in the para position, a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, but that would make the substituent on the benzene a CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me think about the NMR.

The CH2CH(CH2CH3) group would have the following:

- The CH2 adjacent to the ring would be a triplet or something else, but in the given NMR, the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a multiplet. Maybe that's the CH2 next to the CH.

The CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), and the CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H). Then, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH which is split into a multiplet.

Wait, but where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come in? Because 1.4 is a doublet, which suggests it's a methyl group attached to a CH. Like in an isopropyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that's an isobutyl group. But in that case, the isobutyl would have a CH(CH3)2 connected to the benzene via a CH2. So the structure would be 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, let's see:

Benzoic acid at para position, and a isobutyl group attached. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)2.

The NMR of such a structure would have:

- For the isobutyl group: the CH2 next to the ring would split into a quartet if adjacent to two protons. Wait, no, in the isobutyl group, the CH2 is attached to the CH(CH3)2. So, the CH2 would be a triplet, the CH(CH3)2 would be a septet, but that's not matching.

Wait, but in the given NMR, we have:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): maybe the CH in the isobutyl group.

Wait, no. The isobutyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the CH2 is adjacent to the benzene. The CH2 would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH. The CH would be a septet because it's attached to two CH3 groups. The CH3 groups would be a singlet at around 1.4 ppm. But in our data, we have a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is a doublet, meaning it's adjacent to one proton. That doesn't fit an isobutyl group because the CH3 groups are attached to the CH, which would be attached to the CH2. So their protons would be split into septets, not doublets.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. No, that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So the structure would be 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid. Or 4-(isopropyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR again.

If the substituent is a isopropyl group (CH(CH3)2), connected via a CH2 to the benzene ring, then the group would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the CH2 (attached to benzene) would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH which has two Hs). The CH would be a pentet (coupled with two Hs from CH2 and two Hs from adjacent CH3 groups). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the substituent might be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group, making it a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. No, that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group. But that would be a geminal di-substitution, which is not common.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 group, but that's a straight propyl or butyl. But that doesn't match the NMR.

I think I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure. Let me recap the NMR data:

10.5 (bs, 1H) → likely O-H (carboxylic acid)

8.0 (d, 2H) → aromatic protons, likely para to substituent.

7.2 (d, 2H) → same as above.

2.9 (m,1H) → maybe a CH next to something electronegative, like a carbonyl.

1.7 (m,2H) → maybe a CH2 next to a CH.

1.4 (d,3H) → a methyl adjacent to a CH.

0.9 (t,3H) → a terminal CH2CH3.

Hmm. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group. Wait, but that would have the COOH at the end. No, wait, the benzene has the COOH, so the substituent would be another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, let's try to build the structure.

Benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 4. Then, at position 1, a substituent. Let's say the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, but that would make it a longer chain.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Hmm, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet (0.9 ppm), which is a CH2CH3. Then a doublet at 1.4 (3H), which is a CH(CH3) group. Then a multiplet at 1.7 (2H) and 2.9 (1H), which suggests a -CH-CH2- structure.

Putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but then the structure would be benzene with -COOH and -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) groups in para positions.

But let me draw this:

Ph–COOH (para) and Ph–CH2–CH(CH2CH3). But wait, that would make the substituent a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

But then, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the benzene would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH), which would be at around 1.7 ppm? Or perhaps elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. So, the substituent is an isobutyl group attached via a -CH2- to the benzene. So the structure is 4-isobutylbenzoic acid.

So the substituent would be:

Ph–COOH (para) and Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but then the NMR for the substituent would be:

- The CH2 (attached to benzene) would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH group).

- The CH group would be a quintet (coupled with the CH2 and the two CH3 groups).

- The CH3 groups would be singlets, but in reality, they're attached to the same CH, so they would be a septet. But in the data, the CH3 is at 1.4 as a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

So maybe that's not correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group. But that would require a geminal di-substitution, which is less likely.

Wait, let's think about the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) and 2.9 ppm (m,1H). Maybe they form a -CH-CH2- structure, where the CH is adjacent to a carbonyl. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH group. But wait, the COOH is already on the benzene ring. So maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene, and another COOH group elsewhere. But the IR shows only one carbonyl. So no, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent would be a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress. Let's try to consider the options given and see if any match the data.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

So that would be a phenyl group attached to a propanoic acid at position 2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the structure: CH2-COOH attached to the benzene at position 4, but the substituent is at position 2? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the propanoic acid is attached to the benzene in such a way.

But let's think about the NMR of option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So the structure would be benzene with COOH at position 4 and a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) at position 4? No, wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-? No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring. No, wait, the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no. The sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not correct. Wait, the butyl group can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. The sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not correct because butyl is four carbons. Oh, no, the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, but that's five carbons? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, butyl groups: the four carbon chain. The sec-butyl group is the isopropyl group attached via the CH2. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. No, that's incorrect. Wait, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's a pentyl group. I'm getting confused. Let me think: butyl groups have four carbons. The primary butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. The secondary butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the main chain. Wait, no. Let me draw it correctly.

Butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3. So, four carbons in a straight chain.

- sec-butyl: the branching is on the second carbon. So, it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that's five carbons. No, wait, no. Wait, butyl is four carbons. So, sec-butyl would be CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that's three carbons. I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think again. The four carbons in a butyl group:

The primary butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3.

The secondary butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's four carbons. Wait, no. Wait, the secondary butyl would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's five carbons. No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the structure of a sec-butyl group is:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the main chain. No, that's not correct. Maybe I should look it up in my notes, but I can't right now. So perhaps the sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH2-? No, I'm not getting this right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the ring, making a secondary butyl group. But that would only be three carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me look at the options and see which structures fit the given NMR and IR data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group attached at position 4? Wait, no, because in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. So 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the COOH at position 1 and the sec-butyl at position 4.

So the substituents are at para positions.

The substituent (sec-butyl) would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, I think that's actually a pentyl group. I'm getting stuck on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a secondary propyl group.

But in any case, looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The substituent would be a sec-butyl group at the para position relative to the COOH.

In that case, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. No, that can't be right because the substituent would be too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. But that would be a secondary isopropyl group, which is three carbons.

So, how would the NMR look for 4-(isopropyl)benzoic acid?

The substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)2 attached to the ring. So, the substituent is an isopropyl group attached via a CH2.

Wait, that would give:

- The CH2 (attached to ring) as a triplet, because it's next to a CH with two Hs.

- The CH in the isopropyl group would be a septet, as it's next to two CH3 groups.

- The CH3 groups would be a singlet around 1.4 ppm (but in our data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which suggests coupling with one proton).

Hmm, that doesn't fit. Because in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), suggesting a methyl adjacent to a CH, which is adjacent to another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the substituent is a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data again.

We have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3 group.

A doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH, which is attached to something else.

A multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

A multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) is likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.

So putting this together, the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. So the structure would be benzene with COOH and this substituent in para positions.

In that case, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

So the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, but butyl is four carbons. So -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- would be four carbons if it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. No, that would be five carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. But that's a primary butyl group, not a sec-butyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group attached directly to the ring, but that would be a secondary substituent.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reaction first, because once I know the structure, I can predict the product.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which I think is for hydroxy iodide addition but more likely for anti-Markovnikov addition of HI. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes. Wait, no, actually, HI is a strong acid and can add across double bonds. Red phosphorus is sometimes used as a catalyst for certain reactions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a different reaction. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction? No, that's for reducing carbonyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's for the preparation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, no. Another thought: when an alkene reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it's for the formation of a vicinal diiodide. Because red phosphorus can help in the reaction where HI adds twice to the alkene, leading to a diiodide. Oh, but wait, that's not correct because I is a good leaving group, and the reaction would stop after the first addition.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The reaction of an alkene with HI in the presence of red phosphorus is for the anti-Markovnikov addition of H and I. So, the less substituted carbon gets the I.

So, the product would be an iodoalkane where the iodide is on the less substituted carbon.

So, if the starting compound has an alkene, after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, we get an iodide added in the anti-Markovnikov fashion.

But wait, looking at the options, the products are all substituted benzenes. So perhaps the reaction is leading to substitution on the aromatic ring.

Wait, no, that can't be. So perhaps the starting compound has an alkene adjacent to the aromatic ring.

Wait, but the initial compound's structure isn't clear yet. So perhaps I should figure out the structure first.

Let me try to think of the IR and NMR again.

IR:

- 3400–2500 cm-1: broad, probably O-H (carboxylic acid).

- 1720 cm-1: C=O (carboxylic acid).

- 1610 and 1450 cm-1: aromatic C=C stretching.

So, it's an aromatic compound with a carboxylic acid group and possibly an alkene or another group.

Wait, wait a second. Another possibility: the compound is a cinnamic acid derivative. Because cinnamic acid has a benzene ring, a propenoic acid group, and a COOH group. But I'm not sure if that fits the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a benzene ring with an ester group, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which could be an ester. But the O-H peak suggests a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid with an alkene substituent.

So, the structure would be something like benzene with a substituent that is a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, it's a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propenoic acid group. So, like CH2=CH-COOH attached to the benzene. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a CH2CH3 group, so perhaps there's an ethyl group attached.

Another thought: the structure could be a benzene ring with a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the para position of the COOH on benzene.

The structure would be benzene ring with -COOH at position 1 and -CH2-CH(CH3)2 at position 4.

Wait, no, the substituent for 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would be at position 4 relative to the COOH group at position 1. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. No, that's a butyl group, not a sec-butyl. Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that's five carbons. I'm getting stuck on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group, but that's a geminal di-substitution, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a secondary propyl group.

In that case, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. So the structure is 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid? Not sure.

Anyway, moving on, assuming the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, but the starting compound X has an alkene, because the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, which suggests an addition across a double bond. So, if X has an alkene, then the product after reaction would be an iodoalkane.

Wait, but the options given don't show any iodide. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not adding HI to an alkene, but something else. Oh! Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a halogenation of the aromatic ring. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI do that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that typically uses AlCl3 as a catalyst.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think: red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation? No, that's with other conditions.

Wait, I think I was wrong earlier. Red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydroxy iodide method, which is a type of hydrohalogenation. But wait, hydrohalogenation usually adds across double bonds. So, if the starting compound has a double bond, the product would be an iodoalkane.

So, the initial structure of X must have a double bond. But looking at the NMR data, is there any indication of an alkene?

The IR shows peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the range for aromatic C=C. So, the compound has an aromatic ring, but perhaps also an alkene elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks in the range typical for alkenes (around 5 ppm). So maybe the alkene is part of a substituent on the aromatic ring.

So, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group or something similar.

But the problem is that I'm not seeing clear signals in the NMR that would indicate an alkene. So perhaps the starting compound doesn't have an alkene. Hmm. That complicates things.

Wait, but the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus. So, if the starting compound doesn't have an alkene, perhaps the reaction is something else. Maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is a benzene ring with a side chain that has a double bond, like a vinyl group.

But without an NMR signal indicating an alkene, this is hard.

Wait, perhaps the double bond is part of a carbonyl group. No, that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound has a conjugated diene. But again, the NMR doesn't show that.

Wait, perhaps the IR peak at 1720 is an ester group, but the broad peak suggests a carboxylic acid.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think about each option.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with an ethyl group in para position, and a propanoic acid group attached at position 2.

So, it's benzene-2-COOH, with a 4-ethyl substituent.

The NMR would show:

- For the ethyl group: triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH2CH3), quartet at 1.3 ppm (CH2), and triplet at 1.6 ppm (CH next to ring).

But I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl is at position 4, and the propanoic acid is at position 2.

But I'm not sure.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, that's cumene, right? Benzene with isopropyl and methyl groups in para positions.

But the IR would have peaks for an aromatic ring, but no carbonyl. So the IR in the problem has a peak at 1720, which can't be explained by this structure. So option B is probably not correct.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring in the para position to the COOH.

The substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, but that would require five carbons, which is a pentyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the ring (attached to the substituent) as a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH).

- The CH would be a multiplet, perhaps around 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2CH3 group would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have adjacent CH3 groups, but I'm not sure.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

That's a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.

But the IR of the starting compound shows a carbonyl, which this structure doesn't have. So this option is unlikely.

Wait, but the starting compound is X, and the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, so the product must be something else. But the options are given as the products.

Wait, perhaps X is an alkene-containing compound, and the reaction adds HI across the double bond.

So, if X has a double bond adjacent to a substituent on the benzene ring, then the product would be an iodoalkane.

But given the options, perhaps the product isn't an iodide, but rather a substitution on the ring.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Assuming that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but that doesn't have a double bond. So the reaction can't proceed. So perhaps X has a double bond in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group with a double bond. No, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group with a double bond, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps X has a vinyl group attached to the benzene. For example, benzene with a -CH2-CH2-COOH group. But that doesn't fit with the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps X is a styrene derivative. For example, styrene has a vinyl group attached to benzene.

But in the given NMR, we have a broad peak at 10.5, which would be a COOH group. So perhaps X is a vinyl benzoic acid.

Hmm. Let me try to think: if X is something like 4-vinylbenzoic acid, then the substituent would be a vinyl group (CH2=CH-).

Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would add HI across the double bond.

In anti-Markovnikov addition, the I would add to the less substituted carbon.

So, for CH2=CH-, adding HI would give CH2-I-CH2-H. But wait, no, the addition would be anti-Markovnikov, so the H adds to the more substituted carbon and I to the less.

So, CH2=CH- benzene would become CH2-I-CH2- benzene.

Wait, but that would give a CH2-I-CH2- substituent.

Wait, but in the case of 4-vinylbenzoic acid, the structure is benzene with COOH at position 1 and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 4.

Adding HI across the double bond would give benzene with COOH and a CH2-I-CH2- group.

So the product would have a CH2-I-CH2- substituent at position 4.

But that doesn't match any of the options. The options are all substituted benzoic acids or benzene derivatives without iodine.

So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a different structure. Let me think again.

The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps X has an ethyl group attached.

The multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) suggests a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH.

The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl adjacent to a CH.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene.

Wait, that would make the substituent a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making it a secondary propyl group.

So, the structure would be benzene with COOH and a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group in para positions.

But this doesn't account for the triplet at 0.9 ppm. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

In that case, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

The NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to benzene (let's say at 1.7 ppm, m, 2H) as a multiplet.

- The CH (at 2.9 ppm, m, 1H) is the CH next to the CH2.

- The CH2CH3 group (at 0.9 ppm, triplet, 3H) is the end of the chain.

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), as it's adjacent to the CH.

That fits the NMR data.

So the structure of X would be 4-(3-methylbut-1-enyl)benzoic acid? Or perhaps it's a butyl group with a double bond.

Wait, but X must have a double bond for the reaction with HI and red phosphorus.

Ah, so perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group with a double bond somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group with a double bond between the first and second carbons, making it a propenyl group.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group with a double bond between the CH2 and the next CH2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to proceed.

Assuming X has a double bond in the substituent, and the reaction adds HI across it in an anti-Markovnikov fashion.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, but that's a straight chain. No, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group with a double bond, making it a propenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH=CH2 group attached to the benzene. So, the structure would be 4-(propenyl)benzoic acid.

Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would add HI across the double bond.

In anti-Markovnikov addition, the H would add to the more substituted carbon (the middle CH in CH2=CH2CH2), and the I would add to the less substituted (the CH2 end).

Wait, adding HI to CH2=CH2CH2 (but that's not correct, as the substituent is propenyl, which is CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the ring.

Adding HI would give CH2-I-CH2-CH2- attached to the ring, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the addition would be in a way that the I adds to the less substituted carbon.

So, CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the benzene.

Adding HI: H adds to the more substituted carbon (the middle CH), and I adds to the less substituted (the end CH2).

Wait, perhaps:

CH2=CH-CH2- benzene → after addition → CH2-I-CH2-CH3 benzene.

Wait, no, that would be CH2-I-CH2-CH2- benzene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the first and second carbons, making it CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the ring.

Adding HI in anti-Markovnikov would give CH2-I-CH2-CH2- benzene.

So the product would be 4-(1-iodopropyl)benzoic acid.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D. Let's look.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Which is a benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. If the starting material had a double bond, and the addition placed the iodide, but the options don't have iodide, perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not adding HI but doing something else, like an elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the aromatic ring, but I don't think so.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The correct answer is likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Because the NMR and IR data suggest a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid and a substituent that is a sec-butyl group.

So, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what product is formed? Wait, but the reaction is between X and HI, so perhaps the product is the same as X, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis or something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form an alkene, but that doesn't fit with the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent changes, but I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct structure is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But I'm not entirely confident.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the spectroscopic data provided for Compound X:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Broad region, likely an O-H stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: C=O stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, likely the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet, likely a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group (e.g., carbonyl).
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to a CH.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet, likely a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet, likely a terminal CH₂CH₃ group.

### Structural Analysis:
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid. The substituent on the benzene ring is identified as a **sec-butyl group** (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-) based on the NMR signals:
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to a methyl group adjacent to a CH.
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** corresponds to a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.
- The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to the terminal CH₂CH₃ group.

Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction of an alkene with red phosphorus and HI typically results in **anti-Markovnikov addition** of HI across the double bond. However, the given options do not include any products with iodine, suggesting that the reaction does not involve an alkene. Instead, the reaction likely retains the structure of Compound X, as no evidence of a double bond is found in the spectroscopic data.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which matches the description of Compound X and the given spectroscopic data.

**Answer: C**
