Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents from the options given. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

And the options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagents A and B.

Hmm, let's break this down.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methyl acetone. When it reacts with NaCN, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So perhaps this is a nucleophilic addition where CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon.

In the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, the structure would be something like CH2(CN)(OH)(CH2CH3) or maybe more accurately, I think it's (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH3? Wait, no. Let me draw it. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. After adding CN- and then perhaps an acid workup, it becomes (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see, butane has four carbons. The nitrile is on the second carbon, which also has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So it's CH2(CN)(OH)(CH2CH3) or wait, maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2CH3? No, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on the first. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, let me think about the product.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Because HCN adds to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. Oh wait, that's right! So when a ketone reacts with HCN (or CN-), it forms a cyanohydrin. The reaction involves the attack of the CN- on the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen gets a proton, forming an -OH group. So the product is a cyanohydrin.

So the first step is the formation of the cyanohydrin from the ketone and NaCN. But what role does reagent A play here?

Wait, NaCN is a strong nucleophile, but the reaction might require some conditions. Let me remember: in the presence of an acid catalyst, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic. So, when you add HCN to a ketone, you usually use an acid catalyst. So for the first reaction, A is probably H3O+ (which is an acid), because adding H+ would protonate
