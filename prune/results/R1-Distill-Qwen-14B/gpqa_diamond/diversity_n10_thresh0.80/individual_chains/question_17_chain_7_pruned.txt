Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what it says. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when you have a Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration given is 0.02 M for the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius, and the pH is ideal. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex. So K is very large here, which means the complex is very stable, right? Because a large K means the reaction tends to go to completion.

Wait, so the Ca-EDTA complex is given, and we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Oh right, because when EDTA binds to Ca²+, it forms the complex, so the free Ca²+ concentration would be very low. 

Let me think about the formation reaction. The complex formation equation should be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So K = 5x10^10.

But wait, in the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. 

But wait, in reality, when the complex dissociates, it releases some Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the dissolution would be:

CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4− 

The formation constant K is given, so the dissociation constant would be 1/K, which is 2e-11. 

So the reaction quotient is 1/K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2−] = 2e-11.

Let me set up some variables. Let's say the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium is x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. Because for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced. 

Wait
