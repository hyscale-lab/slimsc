Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I need to find the maximum speed. Let me think about what I know. 

First, a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass oscillates around an equilibrium point with a restoring force proportional to the displacement. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so that's probably not the right approach.

In relativity, things get more complicated because as objects move faster, their relativistic mass increases. Oh wait, but some people might argue about whether to use relativistic mass or not. I think in modern physics, we often consider energy in terms of total energy rather than mass. So maybe I should approach this using energy conservation with relativistic considerations.

The total energy of the particle would be the sum of its rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. At maximum displacement A, the oscillator has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy (since it's at rest there momentarily). At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, the potential energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator... I'm not exactly sure about that. In the non-relativistic case, it's (1/2)kx². But relativistically, maybe the potential energy expression changes? Or is it still the same, and the kinetic energy is treated relativistically?

Alternatively, maybe the problem treats the potential as (1/2)kx² regardless of relativity, but the kinetic energy is calculated using relativistic formulas. So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero because the mass is at rest (in the potential maximum). So total energy E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, no. Wait, when the mass is at x=A, it's at the extreme point, so its velocity is zero. So the kinetic energy is zero, and all the energy is potential. Then, when it's at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy at x=0 is E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But I'm not sure if the potential energy is (1/2)kA² in the relativistic case. Because in relativity, the potential energy expressions can sometimes change, but I think in this problem, they're still assuming the same form for the potential.

Wait, but the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the force is the same as in the non-relativistic case. So the potential energy would still be (1/2)kx², I suppose.

So, the total energy E is mc² plus the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E = mc² + (1
