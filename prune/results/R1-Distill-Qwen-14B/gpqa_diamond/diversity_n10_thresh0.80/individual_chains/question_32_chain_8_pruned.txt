Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, I should use the relativistic energy equations. Let me think about what nucleus X is. Oh right, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. Normal lithium-7 has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, but if X has 3 neutrons, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so lithium-6? Because 3+3=6, yeah. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, but for energy calculations, I think I need the mass of the nucleus. The mass of a nucleus isn't just the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, they're assuming the mass is the rest mass of the nucleus as a whole. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed with that.

So the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate gamma first.

Calculating gamma:
v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)² c² = 0.9216 c²
So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
Then sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Now I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

The rest mass energy is m0 c². I think the problem gives me the mass of X, but wait, it's not directly given. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is the sum of the individual protons and neutrons? Because I don't remember the exact mass of Li-6. Let me think: each proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c², and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Calculating m0:
3 * 1.007276 (protons) = 3.021828 GeV/c²
3 * 1.008665 (neutrons) = 3.025995 GeV/c²
Total m0 = 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait a second. The mass of the nucleus is actually less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy. So the actual rest mass would be a bit less than 6.0478 GeV/c². But I'm not sure if the
