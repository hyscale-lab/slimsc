Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Select the suitable reagents for the following reactions. There are two reactions given, and I need to choose the correct options A and B from the choices provided.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, I think I need to analyze each reaction to determine what reagents are needed.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me write down their structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: the nitrile group (CN) is on the second carbon, which is where the ketone was. So I think this is a substitution reaction where the ketone is being converted into a nitrile.

Wait, but under what conditions? I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones are not typically reactive towards nucleophilic substitution because they have a carbonyl group, which is electron-deficient, but the adjacent carbons don't have good leaving groups unless something is happening.

Wait, but wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If that's reacting with NaCN, which provides CN⁻, perhaps the mechanism is similar to the formation of cyanohydrins.

Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone reacts with CN⁻ under specific conditions. I think the typical reagent for that is HCN, but in this case, NaCN is used. So maybe it's a variation.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me structure that. The molecule would have a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon, which is the second carbon.

So the reaction would be: (CH3)2CO reacting with CN⁻. That would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So yeah, that's a cyanohydrin.

So for the formation of cyanohydrins from ketones, the typical conditions involve an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism is that the ketone's carbonyl is protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN⁻ attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an oxonium intermediate. Then water or another proton source helps deprotonate and form the hydroxyl group.

So in this case, reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is H+ from H3O+). So for reaction A, the reagent is H3O+.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Option B: A is H3O+, B is CH3COOH.

Option C: A is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and HSO3⁻. Wait, but that might be for something else.

Option D: A is NaHSO3, B is CH3COOH. Not sure.

So for the first reaction, A should be H3O+ because it's an acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation.

Now, the second reaction: starting with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, treating with B (which is H2O) gives 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. Under what conditions does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical conditions are either acidic or basic hydrolysis. In acidic conditions, you usually have H2SO4 (concentrated sulfuric acid) and heat, and then you might add H2O. But wait, sometimes it's done with H3O+ and heat, or perhaps HCl as a catalyst.

But wait, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, and the other component is H2O. So B is the catalyst perhaps.

Looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

So what's the typical reagent for that? For nitrile to carboxylic acid, one common method is strong acidic conditions. For example, H2SO4 (concentrated) and heat, or using HCl as a catalyst.
