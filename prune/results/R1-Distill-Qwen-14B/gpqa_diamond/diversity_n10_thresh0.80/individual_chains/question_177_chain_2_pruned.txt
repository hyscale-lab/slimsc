Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses; Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively for Star_1 and Star_2.

The main thing we're supposed to find is the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but wait. The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T would be same, because T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So T1 = T2.

But wait, wait. Wait a minute. Are their temperatures the same? Because if their velocities are different, could that affect their temperatures? Wait, no. The radial velocity is the speed at which they're moving towards or away from us. But that affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, not the intrinsic temperature. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps we're considering the observed wavelengths, which would be shifted due to their velocities.

Wait, let me think. The brightness peak in the spectrum (λ_max) is determined by their temperature. But if the star is moving, the observed λ_max would be different due to Doppler shift. So, maybe T affects the intrinsic λ_max, and the observed λ_max is that shifted by the velocity.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is same. So that would imply that their Doppler-shifted λ_max is the same. But their actual (intrinsic) T could be different, but when considering the Doppler shift, the observed λ's would be same.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to break it down.

Let me recap: Both stars have the same observed peak wavelength. So, λ_observed1 = λ_observed2 = same value, say λ.

But each star's actual (intrinsic) temperature T is related to their own λ, considering their Doppler shifts.

Wait, Doppler shift formula: if a source emits a wavelength λ0, and is moving with velocity v relative to the observer, the observed wavelength λ is given by
