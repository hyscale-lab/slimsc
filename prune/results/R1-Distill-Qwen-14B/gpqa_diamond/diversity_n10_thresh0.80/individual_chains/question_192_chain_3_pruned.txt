Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity is smaller, radius r, and its center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The conductor is initially uncharged, which probably means the total charge is zero.

Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. Its distance from the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is θ.

So, I remember that conductors have some properties when it comes to charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, any charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, but the conductor was initially neutral, so when we add +q inside, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the conductor's material must cancel the internal field. But then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the inner -q.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges would distribute themselves. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity) has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. Or wait, no, the outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly because the conductor is spherical, but that's assuming it's a shell. Wait, no, in this case, the conductor itself is a solid sphere with a cavity, so the outer surface's charge would be uniformly distributed because it's a conductor. So, the outer surface's charge would create an electric field as if all the charge were at the center.

But wait, the external field due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as that of a point charge at the center. So for any point outside the conductor (like point P), the field should be due to the +q charge on the outer surface, which is the same as the field of a point charge q at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field there would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Wait, but that's if the charge distribution is spherical. So looking at the options, option B says that. Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²).

But wait, I should think again. Because the charge inside the cavity is +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, and the outer surface +q. So the total charge outside is +q. So the field outside, at point P, is as if all the charge +q is concentrated at the center of the conductor, so E = k q / L², which is option B.

But wait, is there any consideration about the position of the cavity? Like, the cavity is off-center. Oh right, the center of the cavity is separated by s from the conductor's center. So when the charge +q is placed in the cavity, it's not at the center, but shifted by s. Does that affect the external field?

Wait, wait. The cavity is inside the conductor. So for the induced charges, the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge distribution that cancels the field inside the conductor. But the conductor is a conductor, so the electric field inside it is zero. So the charge on the inner surface of the conductor is induced by the charge +q in the cavity and depends on where the +q is placed. But since the conductor is a conductor, the charges would arrange themselves such that the field inside the conductor is zero.

But wait, the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface's charge distribution would be non-uniform, perhaps. But the outer surface's charge would be uniform because the conductor's outer surface is symmetric. Wait, no, because the conductor is a sphere, any charges on the outer surface would distribute
