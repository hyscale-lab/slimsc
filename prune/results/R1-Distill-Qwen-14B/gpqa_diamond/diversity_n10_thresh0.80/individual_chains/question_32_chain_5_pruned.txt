Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a specific nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the nucleus in question is "Li with 3 neutrons." Wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6 because the atomic number (protons) is 3, and neutrons are 3, so 3+3=6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC when the nucleus X (which is Li-6) is moving at 0.96c. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often a significant fraction of the rest mass energy when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, but wait—do I need to calculate the total energy (which includes rest mass energy) or just the kinetic energy? I think in particle accelerators, they usually refer to the kinetic energy as the energy imparted by the collider. But I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

So, the formula I think I need is the relativistic energy equation. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy (m c²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can compute gamma.

Let me calculate gamma first. So v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Plugging in v=0.96c, v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.
