Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves a series of reactions and then determining the NMR coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen. Let me start by breaking down what each step does.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kinda like a cage structure. 1,3-dibromo means there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

Step 1: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and with dibromides, it probably does an elimination reaction. Wait, but wait, dibromides can undergo dehydrohalogenation, right? So two dehydrohalogenation steps here. Since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when KOH is added, each Br is removed, and we form a double bond. So the product should be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that. But wait, no, wait. When you have vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo), elimination gives an alkene. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, in a molecule, even if they're not adjacent, perhaps each Br can undergo elimination. But for that, maybe each Br is on adjacent positions in the adamantane structure. Wait, adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to three others, making a diamond-like lattice. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the bromines on two bridgehead positions. So when KOH is added, each Br leaves as Br⁻, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond. Wait, but with two Br atoms, maybe two elimination steps occur. Oh wait, no, perhaps each Br is removed, leading to the formation of a diene? Or maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, which when eliminated, forms a double bond. So the product would be something like 1,3-diene in the adamantane structure. But I'm not exactly clear on the structure here.

But looking at the product's NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, the
