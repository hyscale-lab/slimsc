Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me read it again carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. So, the first part is about adding a nitrile group. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh, right! I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it's a nucleophilic addition where the CN- adds to the carbonyl carbon.

But wait, usually when you have a ketone reacting with NaCN, you might get an addition product. But in this case, the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. So, perhaps the reaction is a two-step process: first, the addition of CN- to the ketone to form a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with both an alcohol and a nitrile group.

Wait, so adding NaCN to a ketone typically gives a cyanohydrin. But doesn't that require some acid catalysis? Oh, right, because the reaction is usually acid-catalyzed. So reagent A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, some of the choices for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is just a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4, providing H+.

So, for the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN in the presence of H3O+ (option A or B) would form the cyanohydrin. That makes sense because the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, and then the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. Then, water would remove a proton to form the hydroxyl group.

Now the second reaction: the cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile) is reacting with something (reagent B) in water to form a carboxylic acid. Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) must have been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Ah, I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. There are different ways to hydrolyze nitriles. One common method is using H2O with an acid catalyst, like HCl, under reflux. Another method is using a base, like NaOH, but that usually gives a different product, maybe a salt which can be acidified.

Wait, so for the second reaction, reagent B is added along with H2O. So the nitrile is undergoing hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. The question is, what reagent facilitates this?

Hydrolysis of nitriles to
