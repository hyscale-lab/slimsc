Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark, so that part makes sense.

Okay, let me read the problem again. The production energy is 8 GeV, the mass is 1.2 GeV, and the width is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I think I need to calculate the mean decay length and then figure out which option it matches.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like distance = c * tau * beta, where c is the speed of light, tau is the mean lifetime, and beta is the velocity over the speed of light.

Wait, right! The mean lifetime tau is related to the width Gamma by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy and time give us tau ≈ hbar / Gamma. So tau is inversely proportional to the width. But wait, I should make sure about the units. Gamma is given in MeV, and hbar has units of GeV·seconds or something like that.

Let me jot down the equations:

1. Mean lifetime tau = hbar / Gamma
2. Decay distance L = gamma * beta * c * tau
3. Gamma is the total decay width.

Wait, but what's gamma here? Oh, right, gamma is the Lorentz factor which depends on the particle's energy. Since the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, we need to calculate its gamma.

The particle's energy E is given as 8 GeV. Its rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the Lorentz factor gamma is E/(m c²), but since the units are in GeV, maybe c is already accounted for. Let me think: in particle physics, energies are often expressed in units where c=1, so E = gamma m. So gamma would just be E / m. 

So gamma = E / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Wait, 8 divided by 1.2 is the same as 80/12, which simplifies to 20/3, so about 6.6667.

Now, beta. Beta is v/c. For a relativistic particle, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me compute that. Alternatively, since gamma is large (6.6667), beta is approximately 1, but I think I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, beta can also be found using the relation gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Let me compute 1/gamma squared. gamma is 20/3, so (20/3)^2 is 400/9 ≈44.444. So 1/gamma² = 9/400 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking square root gives sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Hmm, but wait. Alternatively, another approach: since gamma is 20/3, which is about 6.6667, and beta is sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))). Let me compute that more precisely.

gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9. 1/gamma^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775
