Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d is 1/plx.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. Wait, stars are uniformly distributed, so their actual number density in space is the same everywhere. But when we observe them, their distribution in terms of parallax changes because of how parallax relates to distance.

So, let's think about the volume of space between two parallax values. Suppose we consider a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd. The volume of that shell would be 4πd² dd. Because for a sphere, volume is 4/3 π r³, but a thin shell is the derivative, which is 4π r² dr.

Since plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. Let's substitute d. So, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - d(plx)/d plx ) * d plx. Wait, because when plx increases, d decreases. So, perhaps I should express everything in terms of plx.

Alternatively, the volume in terms of plx: the shell at plx is thickness d plx, so the corresponding distance shell would have to account for how d changes with plx. Since d = 1/plx, the derivative dd/d
