Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my parallax and distance relationships, but I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So if the parallax (plx) is small, the star is far away, and if it's large, the star is nearby.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I need to find how the number of stars, N, relates to distance, r. The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Wait, because in astronomy, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Alternatively, plx = 1/(distance in parsecs), right?

So if plx is 1/r, then 1/plx would be r. But the question gives N proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me express N in terms of r. 

Since plx = 1/r, substituting into N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. That would be 1/(1/r^5) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. N varies with 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5, where k is a constant. But since plx is inversely proportional to r, plx = 1/r. So plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. Replacing that into N's equation, N = k * r^5.

So as r increases (distance increases), N increases as r^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm. Wait, the number of stars per unit distance. So what's the relationship between N and r? Since N is proportional to r^5, if you take a small change in r, say dr, how does the number of stars in that dr change?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential relationships. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be the surface density multiplied by the surface area of
