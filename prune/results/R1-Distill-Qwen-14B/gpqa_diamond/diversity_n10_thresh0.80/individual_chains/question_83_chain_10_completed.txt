Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see what I can do. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says: We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D. 

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, you can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. The initial concentration is 0.05 M. Let me compute the new concentration.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. V2 is 40 cm³. So 0.05 *20 /40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Oh, wait, 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, right? And 40 cm³ is 40 mL, so 1 mmol /40 mL = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, during titration with NaOH. The reaction is acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with NaOH (a strong base) to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. Let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: volume (L) * concentration. So 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question isn't just about equivalence. We also need the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the way to equivalence... Let me think. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, actually, wait. The 25% is of the total volume needed for equivalence. So if the equivalence is at 10 cm³, then 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added, that's the 25% point.

At this point, how much has reacted? Let's see, moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol, this means that 0.00025 mol of acid has been neutralized, forming acetate. So the moles of acetic acid left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 mol. 

The total solution volume at this point is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³: 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations would be:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, but wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is the negative log of Ka, which is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ log(5.405e4) → wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 

Using log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So at 25% titration point, the pH is pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025/0.0425)/(0.00075/0.0425) ) → which is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So pH = 4.733 + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. So the first part is around 4.26. So for the 25% point, that's 4.26.

Wait, but wait, I should double-check my calculations. Let me see:

Moles of HA: 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of A^-: 0.00025 mol.

Ratio A^-/HA = (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

So yes, the log is -0.477, so pH ≈4.256. So around 4.26. So that's the first value.

Now the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10.

But wait, wait. Let me compute it accurately: 1e-14 /1.85e-5 → 1/1.85 = approx 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. Now, the concentration of acetate comes from the moles of acetate in solution.

At equivalence, all the initial 0.001 mol of acetic acid is converted to acetate. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) plus 10 cm³ (equivalence point volume) → 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. At equivalence, moles of acetate = moles of acetic acid initially = 0.001 mol. The total solution volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion is a weak base, and we can find the pH by calculating the OH- concentration.

The hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So setting up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let x be the [OH^-] produced. So:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, so x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. So [OH^-] = ~3.288e-6 M.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that. Log(3.288)=0.5166. So log(3.288e-6) is 0.5166 -6 = -5.4834. So pOH is 5.4834.

Then pH =14 -5.4834 =8.5166 ≈8.52.

Wait, but that's higher than I thought. Wait, but wait, the acetate is a weak base, so the solution should be basic, which is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact method instead of the approximation.

The expression is Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x≈1.039e-5. Wait, wait, because sqrt(1.081e-11) is approx 1.039e-5? Wait, let me compute it accurately.

Wait, 1e-5 squared is 1e-10. 1e-5.5 is appr 3.16e-6.

Wait, but wait, 3.288e-6 squared is 1.08e-11, yes. Hmm, so [OH^-] is 3.288e-6, pOH is 5.483, pH is 8.517.

So pH at equivalence is around 8.52. So the two values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but another thought: Could I have messed up the equivalence point calculation? Let me double-check.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. Moles needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol, so volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³. Yes.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the concentration is 0.001 / (40 +10) = 0.001 /50 = 0.02 M. Yes.

So the Kb is correct. So the pH calculation seems right. So the equivalence point would be around 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches our calculations.

Wait, but wait, another thought: When you dilute the acetic acid, the initial concentration is correct. So the initial acetic acid is 0.025 M.

So, all the steps seem correct. Therefore, the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the initial concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the pH at 25% titration. At this point, 25% of the NaOH required to reach the equivalence point has been added. The moles of acetic acid initially present are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \cdot 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required for equivalence is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{moles of NaOH}}{M_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added, neutralizing 25% of the acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total solution volume at this point is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \), the ratio \( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.00025}{0.00075} = \frac{1}{3} \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ion. The total solution volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \). The expression for \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \( x \ll 0.02 \), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02} \implies x^2 = 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
