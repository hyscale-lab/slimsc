Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are given as A to D, each with a different vector.

Wait, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So, the given rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). That looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. It's like a completely classical mixture of the two basis states.

But wait, what does this have to do with geometry in qubit space? I think qubits can be represented as vectors in a 3D space using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector gives a geometric picture where pure states are on the surface of the sphere and mixed states are inside.

Right, the general form of a density matrix for a qubit is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). So the coefficients of the Pauli matrices give the components of r.

Let me write down the given rho again. It's (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me expand that. The |0><0| and |1><1| are diagonal matrices with 1s on the respective positions. So when multiplied by 1/2, they become 1/2 on the diagonal.

But wait, |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], which is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2. So rho equals (I)/2.

Comparing this to the general form (I + r·σ)/2, it must mean that the r·σ is zero. Because (I + 0)/2 is I/2, which matches rho.

So r·σ = 0 implies that each component of r is zero. That's because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each multiplied by their respective components. So if r is (x, y, z), then r·σ = xσx + yσy + zσz. For this to be zero, x, y, z must all be zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. That makes sense because the maximally mixed state is the completely depolarized state, corresponding to the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it: the density matrix for the completely mixed state has no coherence terms, only equal populations in |0> and |1>, which is what this rho is. So the Bloch vector is indeed at the origin.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit, which corresponds to equal probabilities of the qubit being in the states \(\left|0\right\rangle\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle\), with no coherence terms. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit can be described by a Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the components of \(\mathbf{r}\) correspond to the coefficients of the Pauli matrices in the general density matrix form:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

with \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\). For the given \(\rho\), it matches the form \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero. This means the qubit is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the completely depolarized state.

Among the options provided, the vector \((0, 0, 0)\) corresponds to the origin in Bloch sphere coordinates. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
