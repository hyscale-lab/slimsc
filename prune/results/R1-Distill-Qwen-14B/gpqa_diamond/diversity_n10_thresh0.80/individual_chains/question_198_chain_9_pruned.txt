Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The β values here are for complexes [Co(SCN)]^n+, where n increases with each β. So, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^+, [Co(SCN)₃]^{n}, and [Co(SCN)₄]^{n}, but I'm not exactly sure about the charges. But the key is that each higher complex includes an additional SCN- ion.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that refers to the [Co(SCN)₂]^{n} species, but I'm not 100% certain. Oh wait, the blue one is usually the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ or something like that. Regardless, the problem is to find the percentage of a specific complex, which I think is the dithiocyanato, meaning two SCN- ligands.

Wait, but let's clarify. The complexes are Co(SCN)ⁿ+ where n is the number of SCN- attached. So the first complex would be Co(SCN), which is Co with one SCN- attached. So each β is for the step-wise formation: β1 is the formation of Co(SCN)^+, β2 is the formation of Co(SCN)₂^+ (since it's adding another SCN-), and so on. So the beta values are cumulative for each step.

Wait, no: Wait, stability constants are usually for the overall formation. So β1 is K1 for [Co(SCN)]^+ formation from Co²+ and SCN-. Then β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ from [Co(SCN)]^+ and SCN-. So each β is for the next step.

Wait, but the way the values are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the overall formation for each complex is the product of the previous β and the current β? Or perhaps each β is the step-wise formation. I think they're the overall stability constants for each n.

Wait no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The stability constant β for a complex [M(L)_n] is the equilibrium constant for the reaction M^(m+) + n L^− ⇌ [M(L)_n]^(m−n+). So for each complex, the β is the overall formation constant.

So for the first complex
