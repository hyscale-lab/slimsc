Okay, let's try to tackle this Michael addition problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question has three parts, all involving the Michael reaction. I remember that the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, which then tautomerizes or something to give the product.

Let's break down each part one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ A.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. I think dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile in the Michael reaction. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So in the Michael addition, the malonate would act as the donor and the acrylate as the acceptor.

So the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt? Or wait, wait. Wait, the formula for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2CH2? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, right? So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? No, wait, wait. Let me think: the acrylate group is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the middle carbon. So it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OEt? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, but wait, the chain is only three carbons: CH2-CH2- COOEt? No,
