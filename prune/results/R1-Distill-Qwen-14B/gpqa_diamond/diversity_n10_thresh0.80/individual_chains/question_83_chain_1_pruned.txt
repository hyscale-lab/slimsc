Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about titration, which I remember involves adding a solution to another to see when they react completely. Let me read the problem again.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, right. So first, I need to figure out the concentrations and moles involved here.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, initial setup: before any titration, we've diluted the acetic acid. Let me calculate the concentration after dilution.

Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Wait, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³ because we added 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of solution. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. No, actually, wait. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and adding 20 cm³ of water makes the total volume 40 cm³. Correct.

So after dilution, concentration of acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the way to the equivalence point.

I need to find out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration.

Wait, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid present.

So, moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (40 cm³ is
