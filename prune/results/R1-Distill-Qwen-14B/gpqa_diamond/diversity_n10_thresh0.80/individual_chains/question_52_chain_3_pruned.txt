Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots on its surface affects the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The main thing I remember from my studies is that the ratio of populations in different energy levels depends on temperature, and this is described by the Boltzmann equation.

So, the star's parameters are: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. But maybe those don't matter directly for this problem. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, is the 5500 K the average? Because spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere.

The question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They want to know by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, the problem gives the transition wavelength as about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. That's probably for calculating the energy difference between the levels using the Planck equation.

I think the key here is the Boltzmann equation, which relates the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels. The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

where:
n2 is the number of atoms in level 2,
n1 in level 1,
g2 and g1 are the statistical weights,
E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
k is Boltzmann's constant,
T is the temperature.

Since the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots vs. when it doesn't, I'm assuming that the statistical weights (g2/g1) are constants and can be ignored for the ratio calculation. So the ratio depends on the exponential term.

Let me denote the initial ratio (without spots) as R1 and the ratio with spots as R2. The question states that R1/R2 is the factor by which the ratio changes. So we're looking for R1/R2 = [n1/n2 when no spots] / [n1/n2 when spots? Wait, wait a second. Wait, the ratio is n2/n1, I think. Let me read the question again.

"Astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So R2 = (n2/n1)_spots is less than R1 = (n2/n1)_no_spots. So the factor is R1/R2.

Wait, but wait. The ratio is n2/n1. When the temperature decreases, what happens to this ratio? Let's think about it. The exponential term is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the term smaller. So n2/n1 decreases when T goes down. Which matches the problem statement.

So R1 is at 6000 K, R2 at 5500 K.

We can model R1/R2 as [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) ) ]

Wait wait, let me compute that step by step.

R1 = n2/n1 without spots = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = n2/n1 with spots = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) 

= exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Because T2 is 5500 K and T1 is 6000 K, so 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1. So 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) is positive.

So R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(5500) - 1/6000) )

But wait, ΔE is the energy difference E2 - E1. Let me write it as ΔE = E2 - E1.

So, to compute this exponent, I need to find ΔE in terms of the given wavelength. The transition between the levels corresponds to a photon of wavelength λ ≈ 1448 Å. 

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. 

But wait, the energy difference ΔE is equal to the photon's energy. Because when an atom absorbs a photon of energy E, it transitions from a lower energy level to a higher one. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So, substituting ΔE = hc/λ.

But let me compute ΔE/(k) in terms of temperature, perhaps? Because the exponent involves ΔE/(k), which is a dimensionless quantity.

Let me compute hc/(λ k). Because then, ΔE/(k) would be hc/(λ k).

Wait, let me compute that numerically.

First, hc is a constant. Let me recall the value. hc is approximately 12400 eV·Å. Wait, yes, because hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm, and 1
