Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says X is a meson resonance. We're supposed to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so I'm guessing we'll have to convert some units at some point.

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel. Oh right, the formula involves the lifetime (τ) and the speed (βc) of the particle. The mean decay length should be the product of τ and βc.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? I think there's a relationship between the width Γ and τ. Oh yes, the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The natural linewidth (Γ) is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something like that. Units are going to be a bit tricky here.

Let me jot down the formula. Mean decay distance is L = c * τ * β. Because τ is the lifetime, and β is the particle's speed relative to the speed of light. So first, I need to find β, and then calculate τ, then multiply by c and β.

But wait, how do I get β? I think relativistic dynamics is involved. The energy E of the particle is given, so perhaps we can find its momentum and then compute β.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). But I also know that E² = (pc)² c² + (m c²)². So E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / c.

Wait, but E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c² respectively. So maybe I should work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1 to make calculations easier,
