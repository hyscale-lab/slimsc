Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is about 1.38e-23 J. And we're supposed to find the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2 under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor describes the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like N_i / N_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote this as ΔE. So ΔE = E_2 - E_1, assuming E_2 is higher.

The problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. I think that means the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is higher in star_1. So maybe in star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that in star_2's excited state.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me define the ratio for each star. For star_1, the ratio would be (N_upper)/(N_lower) = 2 (since it's twice as excited). For star_2, let's say the ratio is (N_upper)/(N_lower) = x. But wait, the problem says star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. So maybe x is 1, and star_1 is 2. So star_1 has a higher ratio than star_2.

But wait, I think the actual setup is that the excitation level is twice as much, so perhaps the ratio N_upper/N_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2." So perhaps in star_1, the population in the excited state is twice that in star_2 for the same level. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.
