Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that the question gives some information about the apparent magnitudes each can observe.

Let me read through the question again. It says that ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 V mag, so apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17, I guess. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent magnitude up to 16. So a star has to have an apparent V magnitude <=16 to be seen by HIRES. And for ESPRESSO, it's <=17.

Wait wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, so that means apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. Same with HIRES, brighter than 16 means V mag <=16.

So the star needs to have an apparent V magnitude <=16 to be detected by HIRES, and <=17 for ESPRESSO. So any star that's <=16 can be seen by both. But wait, the question asks which stars can be detected with both. So the same star must be observable by both instruments.

So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are <=16 for both, but wait, no, because each spectrograph has different limits. Wait, the star must have apparent magnitude <=17 to be seen by ESPRESSO, and <=16 to be seen by HIRES. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16, because that's the stricter condition.

Wait no, no. Because both spectrographs can observe the same star if the star's apparent magnitude is within both's limits. So if a star's apparent V mag is <=16, both can observe it. If it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag must be <=16.

So now I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star.

Let's go through each star.

Star1: RA=15 deg, DEC=-75, absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

Wait, absolute magnitude is
