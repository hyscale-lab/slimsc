Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The broad range between 3400–2500 suggests an O-H stretch, probably from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H peak around 2500-3000. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which makes me think it's a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong downfield shift, probably the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid. The broad singlet (bs) fits because in D2O, the O-H would be exchanged and a singlet. So this supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. The splitting pattern (doublet for each) indicates that each set of protons is adjacent to one substituent. So probably, a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm. This might be a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe part of an ester or ketone group, but wait, the IR suggests a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH next to an oxygen in an ether or something.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, lower field. Maybe part of a chain, like adjacent to a CH group or near a carbonyl.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, likely a CH3 group attached to something that splits the peak into a doublet. Maybe a methyl group attached to a CH group, like in an isobutyl structure.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, probably a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together: The benzene ring is para-substituted. The substituents are likely a carboxylic acid group and some alkyl group. The IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720, which fits a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹, and the O-H is broad. So that fits with the data.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2. So for a para-substituted benzene, if one substituent is a carboxylic acid and the other is an alkyl group, then the two sets of protons would be ortho to each substituent. The more electronegative substituent (the carboxylic acid) would cause the adjacent protons to be downfield. So the 8.0 ppm protons are probably next to the COOH group, and the 7.2 ppm are next to the alkyl group.

So the structure would be something like para-substituted with COOH and an alkyl group. Now, looking at the alkyl groups in the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen or another substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another CH2, perhaps part of a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to something, and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH2CH3.

Wait, let's think about the 1.4 ppm and 0.9 ppm. The 1.4 is a doublet, which suggests it's attached to a neighboring proton. So maybe it's a CH(CH3)2 group? Or perhaps a CH2CH(CH3)2?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and an isobutyl group attached. Let me think: The isobutyl group is (CH2CH(CH2CH3))? No, wait, isobutyl is (CH2)2CH(CH3). Hmm, maybe not. Wait, isobutyl is (CH2CH2)CH2? No, wait, isobutyl is (CH2)CH2CH(CH3)?

Wait, structure of isobutyl: the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. No, wait, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3) attached via the CH2. So the structure would be benzene with a COOH group and an isobutyl group in the para positions.

But wait, the NMR doesn't have a clear triplet for the ethyl group. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which would be the end of a CH2CH2 group. So perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, the NMR shows:

- 0.9 t (3H): that's a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group.

- 1.4 d (3H): a CH3 attached to a CH group.

- The 1.7 m (2H): perhaps the CH2 adjacent to the CH group.

- 2.9 m (1H): the CH group.

So this would suggest a structure like CH2CH2CH3 connected to a CH, which is connected to the benzene ring. Wait, the chain would be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring? No, wait, perhaps the chain is like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but then the 1.7 would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH, which is split by neighboring protons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group. Let's think about the possible structure.

If the benzene ring has a COOH group and a butyl group in the para positions, then the butyl group would have a certain structure. But the NMR doesn't have a triplet for the ethyl group at 0.9 ppm, which usually suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me think about the substituents. The substituent would be a butyl group attached to the benzene.

If it's a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the benzene has a COOH group and a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group in the para positions.

Wait, but the NMR shows:

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). That could be the two protons on the CH2 group next to the CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): the CH group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): the CH3 attached to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): the terminal CH2CH3.

So the structure of the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, no. Let me draw it: the benzene ring has a COOH group and a substituent that is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no. The substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but attached where? Let me think: the substituent is a group connected to benzene, so it's benzene-CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, that would make it a butyl group. Or maybe benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3), but that's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. No, wait: the structure of sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2- no, wait, no. Wait, butyl groups have four carbons. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

A butyl group can be straight-chain (n-butyl), iso-butyl, or sec-butyl.

- n-Butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, no. iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- no, wait iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-? No, wait, iso-butyl is actually (CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Butyl groups:

1. n-Butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH2-

2. iso-Butyl: -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- (I think this is correct, but I'm not sure.)

3. sec-Butyl: -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-

Wait, no. Alternatively, the substituent could be a tert-butyl group, but that's more bulky. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let's think about the NMR:
