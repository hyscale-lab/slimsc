Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has different magnitude limits. Let me think about what I know.

ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, so that's stars with apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so stars with apparent V mag ≤16. So any star that's brighter than 17 in V can be seen by ESPRESSO, but only those brighter than 16 can be seen by HIRES.

Wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is, say, magnitude 15, both can see it. But a star at 16.5 would only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star if not already given, considering any extinction (dust reddening) which affects the observed magnitude.

Looking at the options:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) at 10 pc. So since it's at 10 pc, m = M =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5, which is ≤17 and ≤16. So it can be seen by both. Because 15.5 is less than 16 as well. Wait wait, no wait, HIRES can only see up to 16. So m must be ≤16 for both. 15.5 is okay for both, so Star1 is observable by both. Wait, but wait, no. HIRES can handle up to 16, so Star1's m=15.5 is within both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. That's higher than 16. So HIRES can't see it (since it only goes up to 16). But ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so Star2 is only seen by ESPRESSO. So Star2 is out.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but it's located at 15 pc, and has E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, wait, no. Wait, Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, no: Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but there's extinction. Oh wait no, Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but that's before extinction? Or is that the observed apparent V? Wait, the problem says for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, but E(B-V) is 0.6. So the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So the extinction A_v = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_true + A_v.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, no. No, because the given apparent V is already the observed one. Or is it? Let me read again.

Wait, the question says for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, that might mean that the intrinsic apparent magnitude is higher. Because extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. So if the observed m is 15.5, but the extinction is 1.86, the intrinsic m (without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v = 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about it differently. The apparent magnitude given already accounts for extinction? Or not? Because the problem states that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. But I'm not sure whether the given apparent magnitude is the observed (after extinction) or the intrinsic (before extinction). Wait, the note says that the total absorption in V is related to E(B-V) with coefficient 3.1. So A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V). So if the star's light is dimmed by extinction, the apparent magnitude would be brighter? No, wait, extinction dims the star, so the apparent magnitude becomes larger (since higher magnitude means dimmer). So the observed apparent magnitude is m = m_intrinsic + A_v.

So if the problem states that Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6, that would imply that the intrinsic apparent magnitude is m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v. Because extinction adds to the magnitude.

Wait, no, I think I got it backward. Let me think in terms of flux. The observed flux is F_observed = F_intrinsic * 10^(-0.4 * A_v). So the apparent magnitude increases (because it's dimmer) by A_v. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v.

Therefore, if Star3's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, and A_v is 1.86, that would mean that the intrinsic apparent magnitude is 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But that can't be right because the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be the magnitude without extinction. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the extinction affects the apparent magnitude. A star without extinction has a certain apparent magnitude. If there's extinction, the star appears dimmer, so the apparent magnitude increases.

So, for Star3: The given apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but that's after extinction. So to find the intrinsic apparent magnitude, which is what the star would look like without extinction, we subtract the extinction. Because m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v. So m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86 =13.64.

But wait, wait, the actual question is about whether the star can be observed. So the observable magnitude is the apparent magnitude as observed (m_observed). Because the telescopes detect the light as it is. So if the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, regardless of the extinction, that's the value used. Wait, but no, the extinction is part of the star's observed brightness. So perhaps the given apparent magnitude already includes the extinction. So, in that case, Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is below both 16 and 17, so it's detectable by both. But wait, wait. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the star's apparent magnitude as seen from Earth is the m_observed, which includes extinction. So when the question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6, that apparent magnitude is after the extinction. So for the purpose of determining if the star is visible by the spectrographs, we use that m_observed value.

So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is ≤16 and ≤17. So both telescopes can detect it.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the given apparent magnitude in Star3 is the intrinsic one, meaning the actual brightness without extinction, and the extinction is making it dimmer. So Star3's intrinsic apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the observed apparent magnitude is higher. So in that case, m_observed =15.5 + 1.86 =17.36. Which is above 17, so only ESPRESSO can see it (since ESPRESSO goes up to 17).

But I'm not sure whether the given apparent magnitude for Star3 is the observed or intrinsic. The question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". But in reality, the observed apparent magnitude includes extinction. So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed value, meaning that the extinction has already been accounted for. Or does it mean the star's apparent magnitude before extinction?

Wait, the way the problem is written, for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is given. So I think the 15.5 is the observed (after extinction) magnitude. Because if the apparent magnitude were 15.5 without considering extinction, then the observed would be higher.

So, in that case, Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which is within both telescopes' limits.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Let's consider Star3's parameters. It's RA 11h, DEC 48, apparent V 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc. So the E(B-V) relates to the extinction. So extinction A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V) =1.86 mag.

If the apparent magnitude m_obs is 15.5, but without extinction, the star would appear brighter. So m_intrinsic = m_obs - A_v =15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But I'm not sure if that's relevant because the telescopes observe the star as it appears, which is m_obs.

Wait, but the question is about the star's apparent magnitude as observed. So for both telescopes, the apparent magnitude is what matters. So for Star3, it's 15.5, which is okay for both.

Wait, but wait another scenario: perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the extinction makes it dimmer. So if the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) is 15.5, then the observed would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is beyond ESPRESSO's limit of 17. So Star3 would only be detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

But that contradicts. So how can I figure out which scenario is correct?

The problem states: "the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So the absorption (extinction) A_v =3.1 * E(B-V). So Star3's A_v is 1.86.

Now, the apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. So the question is: is this the observed apparent magnitude (m_obs) including A_v, or the intrinsic (m_intrinsic)?

In astronomy, when someone gives the apparent magnitude, it's usually the observed one, which includes extinction. So I think in this problem, Star3's m_obs is 15.5. So it's under both 16 and 17, so both telescopes can see it.

Wait, but let's consider Star4. Star4: RA 85, DEC -48. Absolute V mag 15.5. Distance 10 pc. So since absolute magnitude is M=15.5, and distance is 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude m = M =15.5. Then, E(B-V)=0.4, so A_v=3.1*0.4=1.24. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the observed m 16.74. Which is above HIRES's limit (16) but under ESPRESSO's 17. So for Star4, m_obs is 16.74. So HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because if the absolute magnitude is 15.5 and the distance is 10 pc, the apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5. But extinction makes it appear dimmer, so m_obs =15.5 +1.24 =16.74.

So for Star4, m_obs is 16.74. So ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.74 <17), but HIRES can't (16.74>16). So Star4 is only detected by ESPRESSO.

But wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So Star4 is only detected by ESPRESSO, so it can't be a correct answer when considering both.

Wait, but wait, the question says "apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 with HIRES." So stars with m ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Hmm, wait, the way it's phrased, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" — but in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So "brighter than 17" would be m <17. Similarly, brighter than 16 is m <16.

So for ESPRESSO, m ≤17. For HIRES, m ≤16.

So Star1: m_obs=15.5 → both can see.

Star2: m_obs=16.5 → ESPRESSO can see (16.5 ≤17), but HIRES can't (16.5>16).

Star3: m_obs=15.5 → both can see.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → ESPRESSO can see, HIRES can't.

Star5: Absolute V mag=16.5, distance 5 pc. So apparent magnitude without extinction would be m = M +5*(log10(d/10)) =16.5 +5*(log10(5/10))=16.5 +5*(log10(0.5))= 16.5 +5*(-0.3010)≈16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0. Then, E(B-V)=? Wait, Star5's parameters: absolute V mag=16.5, distance 5 pc. No mention of E(B-V), so E(B-V)=0. So the apparent magnitude is 15.0. So m_obs=15.0. So both telescopes can detect it.

Wait, Star5's m_obs is 15.0, which is ≤16 and ≤17. So both can see it.

Wait, but let me check all the stars again:

Star1: m_obs=15.5 → both can see.

Star2: m_obs=16.5 → ESPRESSO can (16.5 ≤17), but HIRES can't.

Star3: m_obs=15.5 → both can see.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m_obs=15.0 → both can see.

So which options have stars that are detectable by both?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, so no. So A is wrong.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Both can be seen by both, so yes.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2 only by ESPRESSO, so no.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 only by ESPRESSO, so no.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake with Star3's m_obs?

Because Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but it has E(B-V)=0.6. So does that affect the m_obs? Because the given m_obs is 15.5, which is already the extinction-included value. Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the extinction makes it appear dimmer.

Wait, that's a crucial point. If Star3's apparent V is 15.5 without considering extinction, then the observed would be 15.5 +1.86 =17.36, which is above both telescopes' limits. But that can't be right because 17.36 is above ESPRESSO's limit (17), so only stars with m ≤17 are detected. So 17.36 would not be detected by ESPRESSO either. But that can't be, because the problem states that Star3's apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So how to interpret this?

Wait, maybe the problem gives the apparent V magnitude as the observed value. So the 15.5 already includes the extinction. So when the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag", that's the observed (after extinction) value. So in that case, Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is within both telescopes' limits.

Alternatively, if the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), then the observed would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is beyond both's limits. But that would mean Star3 can't be detected by either, which seems unlikely.

But the way the problem is written, Star3's apparent V is given. So I think it's the observed value. So for Star3, m_obs=15.5 → both can detect.

But let me go back to the problem statement. For Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. It also says, "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So the absorption, A_v =3.1 * E(B-V)= 1.86.

So Star3's m_obs is given as 15.5, which includes the extinction. So m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_v → m_intrinsic=15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But when considering detection, the m_obs is what matters, which is 15.5. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, but no, wait! Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because if the star's apparent magnitude as observed is 15.5, then that's the value we should use. Because that's the brightness as it appears to us. The extinction is already accounted for in that value. So Star3's m_obs=15.5, which is within both's limits.

So now, the list:

Stars detectable by both:

Star1: m_obs=15.5 → yes.

Star3: m_obs=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m_obs=15.0 → yes.

Wait, but wait, Star5's E(B-V) is zero. So Star5's m_obs is 15.0, which is within both.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star5's m_obs is 15.0. Let me recalculate.

Star5: absolute V is 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Apparent magnitude without extinction is m = M +5 log10(d/10) =16.5 +5*(log10(5/10)) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505=14.995. So m= ~15.0.

And no extinction (E(B-V)=0), so m_obs=15.0.

So Star5 is detectable by both.

So which stars can both telescopes detect? Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both yes.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m_obs=16.74, which is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So option B has Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is detectable by both. Star5's m_obs is 15.0. So option B is correct.

But wait, the options don't include both Star1 and Star5. So if Star1 and Star5 are both detectable, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck each star:

Star1: m_obs=15.5, detectable by both.

Star2: m_obs=16.5 → ESPRESSO only.

Star3: m_obs=15.5 → both.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m_obs=15.0 → both.

So which options pair stars detectable by both:

Possible pairs are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

Is there any other option that includes any two of these three?

Yes, option B is correct.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the telescopes' respective limits:

- **ESPRESSO** can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 17.
- **HIRES** can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤ 16.

Thus, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤ 16 to be detectable by both telescopes. Additionally, we account for extinction (if provided) to calculate the observed apparent magnitude.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 10 pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 (since absolute magnitude equals apparent magnitude at 10 pc).  
   - No extinction mentioned.  
   - Observed apparent magnitude = 15.5.  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 16.5.  
   - No extinction mentioned.  
   - Observed apparent magnitude = 16.5.  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO (16.5 ≤ 17) but not by HIRES (16.5 > 16).

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 15.5, E(B-V) = 0.6.  
   - Extinction in V band, \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude = 15.5 (already accounts for extinction).  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 10 pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 (since absolute magnitude equals apparent magnitude at 10 pc).  
   - E(B-V) = 0.4, \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74.  
   - Detectable by ESPRESSO (16.74 ≤ 17) but not by HIRES (16.74 > 16).

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 16.5, distance = 5 pc.  
   - Apparent V magnitude = \( M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 \approx 15.0 \).  
   - No extinction mentioned.  
   - Observed apparent magnitude = 15.0.  
   - Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1, Star3, and Star5**. Among the options provided, **Star3 and Star5** are the correct pair.

**Answer: B**
