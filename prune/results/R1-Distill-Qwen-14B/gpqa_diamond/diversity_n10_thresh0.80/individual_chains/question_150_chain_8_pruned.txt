Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. Let me read through the question carefully.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's helpful. So, the compound has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. The NMR data is given, and after reacting with certain reagents, we need to find the final product. The options are A to D.

The reagents are in three steps. Step 1 is NaNO2 and HCl. Oh wait, that's usually a nitrous acid treatment. For aromatic amines, that's a diazotization reaction. But wait, under what conditions? If it's at low temperature (like 0-5Â°C), it forms a diazonium salt. But if it's at higher temps, maybe something else happens. But in this case, step 1 is diazotization.

Then step 2 is H2O. So maybe hydrolysis? Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions. In aqueous conditions, maybe it's a hydrolysis to form a phenol, but that depends on other factors like the presence of other reagents.

Step 3 is aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds like a nucleophilic substitution or elimination reaction. Or perhaps some kind of elimination, like the formation of a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data now. Let me list the signals:

9.72 ppm: a triplet, 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Or maybe an aromatic proton in a strongly deshielded environment.

6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H. Maybe aromatic protons. Let's see, if there are two protons as a doublet, perhaps adjacent to substituents.

6.51 ppm: doublet, 2H. Another aromatic pair.

6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H. Broad indicates possibly exchange with D2O or maybe an -OH group. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substituents causing broad coupling, but I'm not sure.

3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H. This is likely a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe next to an oxygen, like an ether or aldehyde?

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. DOU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2= 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from one ring and two double bonds, or other combinations. But likely, it's a benzene ring (3 DOU) plus a double bond and another ring or a carbonyl.

Looking at the NMR, the 9.72 ppm is a triplet. Aldehyde protons are typically around 9-
