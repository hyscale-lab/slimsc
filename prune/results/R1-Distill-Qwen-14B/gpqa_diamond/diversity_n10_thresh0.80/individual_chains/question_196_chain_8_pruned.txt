Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is found when all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't use the classical formulas directly.

The question gives that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², right? But in relativity, things get more complicated because kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, in relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy would then be E - mc², which is (gamma - 1)mc².

So, the potential energy at maximum displacement (x=A) should equal the kinetic energy at maximum speed. So, (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1)mc². 

Let me write that down:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc²

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

(1/2)kA² = [ (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ] * mc²

Hmm, I need to solve for v_max. Let me rearrange this equation.

Let me denote beta as v/c for simplicity. So, beta = v/c. Then, sqrt(1 - beta²) is the denominator in gamma.

So, equation becomes:

(1/2)kA² = [ (1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)) - 1 ] * mc²

Let me divide both sides by mc²:

( k A² ) / (2 mc² ) = [ (1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)) - 1 ] 

Let me rearrange the right side:

[ (1 - sqrt(1 - beta²)) / sqrt(1 - beta²) ) ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to move terms around. Let's move the 1 to the other side.

( k A² )/(2 mc² ) + 1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² )

Let me take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² ) ]

Hmm, square both sides:

1 - beta² = 1 / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 mc² )) )^2 ]

So,

beta² = 1 - 1/[ (1 + (k A²/(2 mc² )) )^2 ]

Let me compute 1 - [1/(something squared)]. Let me compute the denominator:

Denominator = [ (1 + (k A²/(2 mc² )) ) ]² = 1 + (2 * k A²/(2 mc² )) + (k A²/(2 mc² ))^2 

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write beta in terms of v_max/c.

Alternatively, to express beta as sqrt(1 - (1/(denominator))^2 ), but maybe I'm getting too tangled. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, they express v_max in terms of c multiplied by some square roots. Let me see which expression matches what I have.

Option C is sqrt(kA²/m), which is the classical maximum speed. But since we're in relativistic case, that's probably not the right answer unless kA²/(2m) is small, but the question doesn't specify that. So I can't choose C.

Looking at the other options:

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )^2 )

Wait, but my expression has denominator involving (1 + (kA²/(2 mc² )) ), squared. 

Wait, let's re-examine my steps. After I have:

beta² = 1 - 1/( [1 + (k A²/(2 mc² )) ]² )

Which can be written as:

beta² = [ (1 + (k A²/(2 mc² )) )² - 1 ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 mc² )) )² ]

Wait, numerator is (a² - 1), which is (a-1)(a+1), where a = [ 1 + (k A²/(2 mc² )) ]

Wait, let me compute a² -1:

a² = [ (1 + x) ]^2 = 1 + 2x + x^2, so a² -1 = 2x + x², where x is kA²/(2 mc² )

Hmm, but perhaps another approach. Let me express beta as sqrt(1 - (1/(a)^2)), where a is (1 + x ), x being kA²/(2 mc² )

Wait, so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(a^2)) = sqrt( (a² -1)/a² ) ) = sqrt( (a² -1) ) / a

So, beta = sqrt( (a² - 1) ) / a 

But a = [ 1 + (kA²/(2 mc² )) ]

Hmm, perhaps substitute a into the expression.

Alternatively, let me write v_max = beta c.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( (a² -1) ) / a 

= c * sqrt( ( [1 + x]^2 -1 ) ) / [1 +x ] 

where x = k A²/(2 mc² )

Expanding [1 + x]^2 -1 = 1 + 2x +x² -1 = 2x + x² = x (2 + x )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( x (2 + x) ) / [1 +x ]

Let me substitute x = kA²/(2 mc² )

So,

sqrt( x (2 + x) ) = sqrt( [kA²/(2 mc² ) ] * [ 2 + kA²/(2 mc² ) ] )

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute the numerator inside the square root:

x (2 +x) = (kA²/(2 mc² )) * [ 2 + (kA²/(2 mc² )) ]

= (kA²/(2 mc² )) * [ (4 mc² + k A² ) / (2 mc² ) )

= (kA² (4 mc² + k A² )) ) / (4 m² c^4 )

Hmm, getting complicated. Maybe it's better to see which option matches the expression I have.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: c*sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )² )

Wait, let me compute 1 - (kA^2/(2m))= 1 - x * 2 m c² / (k A² ) ? Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me see:

Wait, in the denominator inside the square root of option A, it's (1 - (kA²/(2m)) )². But in our expression, the denominator is [1 + (kA^2/(2 mc² )) ]².

So option A seems different. Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2mc²)) )) which inside is simpler but with 2mc².

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier when I set PE = KE, in relativistic terms, PE is (1/2)k A², which is correct. KE is (gamma -1) mc².

So,

(1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc² → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² )

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² )

Square both sides:

1/(1 - beta²) = [1 + (k A²/(2 mc² )) ]²

So,

1 - beta² = 1 / [
