Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λf f̄(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y)

Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh right, probably it's something like an interaction term where X couples to fermion fields. The exact terms might be a bit tricky, but the key thing is that the boson X interacts with fermions, which would mean it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So the question is about what particles X can decay into at the lowest order.

I remember that for a particle to decay into a pair of particles, the total energy (which is the mass of the decaying particle) must be at least equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. So for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if twice the fermion mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list out all the possible fermions and their approximate masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): similar, around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): around 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are too light, but since the mass is negligible, but in practice, for high-energy physics, they can be considered as having zero mass.

Wait, but the interaction term involves ψ_f, which I suppose are fermion fields. The Lagrangian as given might imply that X couples to all charged fermions, or perhaps only the ones with a certain property. Wait, the term given is -λf f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe the interaction is between X and fermions ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion that it couples to.

But wait, the actual coupling would depend on the type of interaction. For example, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to fermions via Yukawa interactions. The Higgs can decay into any fermion pair as long as the energy allows it and the fermions are charged under the Higgs's symmetry. But in this case, the problem doesn't specify the interaction type beyond the Lagrangian given.

But for the purpose of this problem, I think we can assume that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the kinematics allow it. So the possible decay products would be any fermion pair where the combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So let's
