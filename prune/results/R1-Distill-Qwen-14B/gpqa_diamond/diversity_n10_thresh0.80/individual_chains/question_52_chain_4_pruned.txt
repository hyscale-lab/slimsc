Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me first read the question carefully.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They observe that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe visible range. And the photosphere is in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the usual rules of thermal emission apply.

Hmm, okay. So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this case, when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. Wait, but the spots are cooler regions, right? So if 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff would be lower. But how does the observed ratio change?

Wait, the observed ratio decreases when there are spots. The ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1? The question says the ratio decreases. Let me think.

Wait, the ratio is the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 versus level 2. So, when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) goes down. So, the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present.

Wait, but why would the ratio change? Because the temperature changes. Because when the spots are present, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. But wait, the photosphere where the Ti lines form might be at a different temperature than the overall effective temperature.

Wait, but the question says that the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. So the photosphere's temperature is lower when spots are present.

Wait, but wait. The star's surface is covered by spots, which are cooler. So the overall effective temperature (which is the average) goes down. So the photosphere's temperature would be lower when spots are present. But how does that affect the excitation of the Ti atoms.

Because the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels depends on the temperature. At lower temperatures, the higher energy level (E2) has fewer atoms because thermal energy is lower, so the ratio n2/n1 is lower.

Wait, let's think about the ratio. Let's say the two energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)). So if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, n1/n2 increases because if n2/n1 is smaller, then n1/n2 is larger.

Wait, but the question says the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. Wait, that implies that when T decreases, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Hmm, that would mean that the ratio is n2/n1? Because when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, so n1/n2 increases.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:

The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels is n2/n1. When T decreases, n2/n1 decreases because the exponential term becomes smaller. So if the observed ratio (n2/n1) is lower when there are spots, that would be consistent with a lower T.

But the question says that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, no. Wait, the question says when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's see: the ratio is (n_level1) / (n_level2). So when the star has spots, this ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So during spots, n1/n2 is lower than when the star is spotless.

Wait, but wait. For a given transition, if the lower level is level 1 and the upper is level 2, then the ratio (n1/n2) is higher when T is lower. Because if temperature is lower, fewer atoms can be excited to the higher level. So n2 is lower, so n1/n2 would be higher.

But the question says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if the ratio is lower when the star has spots, that implies that the temperature is higher. Because when the star has spots, the overall photospheric T is lower. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, maybe I got the transition wrong. Or perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1). Let me think again.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Let's see, 1448 Å is about 144.8 nm, which is in the near-ultraviolet. Titanium lines in this region are probably formed in the photosphere, and the excitation is temperature-sensitive.

If the star's photospheric temperature decreases when spots are present, then the ionization and excitation states of atoms would change. Lower temperatures would lead to less excitation to higher energy levels. So for a given transition from level 1 to level 2 (assuming E2 > E1), the number of atoms in level 2 (n2) would decrease. So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease, and n1/n2 would increase.

But the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is n2/n1, then when the star has spots, n2/n1 goes down. So the ratio when spotless (T=6000 K) is higher than when spotted (T=5500 K).

Wait, but the question says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio is n1/n2. Wait, no. Let me figure this out.

Let me think of an example. Suppose level 1 is lower energy, level 2 higher. So when T is higher, more atoms are in level 2. So n2/n1 increases with T.

So when T is 6000 K, n2/n1 is higher than when T is 5500 K. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so n2/n1 is lower. Therefore, the ratio n2/n1 decreases when the star has spots. So the observed ratio (n2/n1) is lower when spotted.

But the question says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. If n2/n1 is lower when spotted, that means n1/n2 is higher, because it's the reciprocal. So if the observed ratio (n1/n2) is decreasing when the star has spots, that would mean that n1/n2 is lower when T is lower. Which would mean that as T decreases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, that seems contradictory. Because, from the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 is (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So as T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes a larger positive number (since E2 > E1). So exp of that would increase, making n1/n2 increase. So if T decreases, n1/n2 increases, so the ratio (n1/n2) would be higher when T is lower.

But the question says when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So that's conflicting. So perhaps I'm getting the levels mixed up.

Wait, perhaps the transition is considered as level 2 to level 1. Or maybe the way the ratio is presented is swapped.

Wait, let's consider that the transition is from level 2 to level 1, so it's an emission line. Then the ratio would involve n2 and n1. But in terms of excitation, if the star is hotter, more atoms are in level 2, so for an emission line, higher temperature would mean more emission.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the excitation temperature. The observed line strength depends on the ratio of the populations. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio that's observed is (n2)/(n1), the number in the upper level to the lower level. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower, so (n2/n1) decreases. So the ratio when spotless is (6000 K) and spotted is (5500 K).

But the question says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio is (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1), then when (n2/n1) decreases, (n1/n2) increases. So that would mean, when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is higher. But the question says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the situation. Let me denote R as the ratio n1/n2.

In the case without spots, Teff is 6000 K. With spots, Teff is 5500 K. So when T decreases, R changes.

If R = n1/n2, and when T decreases, R increases (because lower T means fewer atoms are excited, so n2 is lower, so R is higher). So
