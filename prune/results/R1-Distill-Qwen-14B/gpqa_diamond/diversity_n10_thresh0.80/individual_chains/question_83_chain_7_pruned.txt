Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

So the question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D. I need to figure out both pH values and match them to the options.

First, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So let's start by calculating the concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and concentration is 0.05 M. Then adding 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³.

The formula for dilution is C1V1 = C2V2. So C2 is (C1V1)/V2. Plugging in the numbers: C2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Wait, 20 divided by 40 is 0.5, so 0.05 * 0.5 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will react with a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Moles = Molarity * Volume. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Now, when titrating, the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence can be found. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles = M * V → V = moles / M. So V = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the problem says we're looking at 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, when you titrate, you're adding 25% of the equivalence volume. So if the equivalence point is at 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³, how much NaOH has reacted with the acetic acid.

How many moles of NaOH have been added? 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, after adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the moles of acetic acid will decrease by 0.00025, and moles of acetate will increase by 0.00025.

So the initial moles after dilution: CH3COOH = 0.001 mol, CH3COO^- = 0.

After adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH:

CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol

CH3COO^- = 0 + 0.00025 = 0.00025 mol

Wait, but wait, the total volume at 25% titration is initial solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³ total. So concentrations would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, to find pH at this point, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73. Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's
