Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the luminosity of a star as a black body relates to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

The problem says both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Wait, the peak wavelength. Oh, right, that's the peak emission according to Wien's law. Wien's displacement law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures should be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, T must be the same, because T = b / λ_max. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. If the stars have the same temperature, then the only factor affecting their luminosity is their radius. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. So since T is the same, L is proportional to R squared. 

But in this problem, Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1 would be (1.5)^2 times L2. 1.5 squared is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but there's more. Oh, wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of
