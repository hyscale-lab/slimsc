Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are points in some space, probably the Bloch sphere, since that's the common geometrical representation for qubits.

Wait, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a single qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent such states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

So, any single qubit state can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ> is |ψ><ψ|. For a mixed state like this one, it's a convex combination of projectors onto different states.

The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's an equal mixture of the states |0> and |1>. I remember that this is actually the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. It has maximum entropy, meaning it's completely uncertain.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the state is at the origin. Because the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Let me think why. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (rx, ry, rz).

So, if ρ has no coherent terms (the off-diagonal terms are zero), then the Bloch vector r must be along the z-axis maybe, but wait, in this case, the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonals are 1/2 each.

Wait, let's compute ρ for this case. The given ρ is:

ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's express each term. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], then multiplied by 1/2: [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. So the matrix is diagonal with entries 1/2 each.

The density matrix for a mixed state with equal probabilities of |0> and |1> would have this form. So in terms of the Bloch vector, the general form is (I + rx X + ry Y + rz Z)/2, where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

Since the given ρ has all off-diagonal elements zero, that means the X and Y terms (which affect the off-diagonal) must be zero. So rx and ry are zero. What about rz?

The diagonal elements are 1/2 + (rz*1)/2. Because the (1,1) element would be (1 + rz)/2, right? Because the Z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so when you multiply by (I + rz Z)/2, the diagonal elements are (1 + rz)/2 and (1 - rz)/2.

In our given ρ, the diagonals are both 1/2. So:

(1 + rz)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + rz = 1 → rz = 0.

Similarly, (1 - rz)/2 = 1/2 → same result. So rz is zero.

So the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin. That would correspond to the completely mixed state, as expected.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state that is an equal probability superposition of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. 

For the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal terms are zero, which implies that \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). The diagonal terms are both \(1/2\), which corresponds to \(r_z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector is \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
