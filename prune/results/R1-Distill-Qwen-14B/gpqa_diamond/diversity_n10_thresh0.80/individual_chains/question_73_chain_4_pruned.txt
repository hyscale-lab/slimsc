Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. I need to calculate both.

First, relative speed. I remember that in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like you do in classical mechanics. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, no, that's if they're moving in the same direction. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the formula is for when you're finding the relative speed of one object from the frame of another. Let me get this right.

If astronaut A is moving at velocity u relative to the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at velocity v in the same direction, then from A's perspective, what is B's speed? So the formula would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), but wait, wait. No, wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So if u is the speed of the first astronaut (0.6c) and v is the speed of the second astronaut (0.5c), then the relative speed of B from A's frame would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, that would give a negative value because v < u. So the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²))?

Wait, no, I think I got it reversed. Let me think again. The formula for velocity addition is: when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check the formula correctly.

The correct formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) when both are moving in the same direction. So if astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute that.

First, calculate the numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. But since speed is a magnitude, maybe the negative indicates direction. But when calculating relative speed, perhaps we take the absolute value. Alternatively, maybe the relative speed is the magnitude, so 0.1c. Wait, no, because if u is larger than v, then from A's frame, B is moving backward, but wait, no, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be how fast B is moving behind A. Or wait, wait no, if u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c, then from the lab frame, A is faster than B. So from A's frame, B is moving backward at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6 * 0.5)), but let me compute this correctly.

Wait, the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)) when you're finding the speed of an object moving at v in the lab frame from the perspective of a frame moving at u. Wait, I think I've got the variables mixed. Let me get the formula right.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is: if frame S' is moving at speed u relative to frame S, then the speed of an object in S' is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c^2)), where v is the object's speed in S. So in this problem, if we're considering the speed of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A's frame, then u is A's speed relative to the lab, which is 0.6c, and v is the speed of B in the lab frame, which is 0.5c. So applying the formula: (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the denominator first. 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3. So (0.3 c²)/(c²) is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

The numerator is 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -0.142857c. The negative indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction from A's perspective, but the speed is 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have relative speed 0.14c, so they're possible.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the relative speed is considered as the magnitude, so 0.14c. So that's the first part done.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm, so the system is the two astronauts. So the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(
