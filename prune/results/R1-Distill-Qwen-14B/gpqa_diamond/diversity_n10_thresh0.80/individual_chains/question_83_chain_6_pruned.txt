Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Hmm, first, I think I need to figure out what the diluted concentration of acetic acid is after mixing. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the volumes. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³.

Wait, right, the formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. So here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³.

Calculating that: 0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol. Then divided by 40 cm³ (since 1 cm³ is 1 mL and M is mmol/cm³), so 1/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Okay, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH. Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, I know that the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed for that. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) → 0.001 mol.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So, moles = M * V → V = moles / M → 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So, at this point, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Wait, another approach: the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.0025 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol of
