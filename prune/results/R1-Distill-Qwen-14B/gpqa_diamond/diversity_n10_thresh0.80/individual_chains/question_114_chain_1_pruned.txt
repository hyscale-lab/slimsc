Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find out which reagents A and B are used in each. The options are A to D, each giving possible reagents.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that nitriles can be formed via some kind of addition. Oh right, the formation of cyanohydrins. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the nitrile group adds to a carbonyl, along with a hydroxyl group.

So the reaction of a ketone with NaCN typically involves an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A and B for reagent A). The mechanism is that the ketone reacts with CN- (from NaCN) in an acid-catalyzed addition. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the nitrile attacks, and after some steps, we get the cyanohydrin. So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+.

Wait, but the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so when the cyanohydrin forms, the nitrile and hydroxyl will be on the same carbon as the ketone. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's count the carbons. Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The cyanohydrin would have the OH and CN added to the same carbon. So structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see: butanenitrile is four carbons, and the hydroxyl and methyl are on carbon 2. So the structure would be (CH(CH3)(OH))CH2CN? Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is CH2(CN)(OH)CH(CH3)2? No, not sure. But regardless, the first step's reagent is H3O+ because it's the acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. So reagent A is H3O+.

So looking at the options, A and B are H3O+ for A. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about. Maybe in some other reaction?

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutan
