Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25 °C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The given Ka for acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are from A to D.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, when you dilute acetic acid with water, the concentration will change. Because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration is halved. So the initial step is to find the new concentration after dilution.

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. When you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration (C1) is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Because 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 1 mmol (since 0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol). Then when you add 20 cm³, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 1 mmol / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about the titration process.

At 25% titration—wait, what does that mean? I think it means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, we need to find the pH at that point.

Wait, no—wait. Actually, when you talk about titration percentage, it's usually the percentage of the volume of titrant added compared to the equivalence point volume. So, perhaps I should first find the equivalence point, then calculate the volumes and moles at 25% of that.

So, let's find the equivalence point first. The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are 40 cm³ * 0.025 M. Wait, 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in L). So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. So, n = 0.001 mol.

Since each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH (because the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), so the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence are also 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

So, when the question says 25% titration, that would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Now, let's calculate the moles of NaOH added: 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. Moles = 0.1 M
