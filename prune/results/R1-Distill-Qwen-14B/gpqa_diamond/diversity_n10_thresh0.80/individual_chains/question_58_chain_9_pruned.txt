Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like when calculations give infinite results. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So, the correct answer is the one that doesn't have these divergences at high energies.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. Since it's a theory that includes gravity, maybe it doesn't run into the same infinities as other quantum theories? Or perhaps it handles things differently. I'm not too sure, but I recall that string theories often avoid some of the problems that other QFTs face because they're background-independent or something like that. But wait, do they still use regularization techniques? I'm not certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small, so perturbative methods work. But do we still need regularization here? I think QCD calculations, especially in loop corrections, can lead to divergences. So regularization must be used to handle those, like using lattice methods or dimensional regularization. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. In QED, when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals, right? That's why renormalization is needed. Regularization is a step in renormalization where you make the divergences explicit so you can subtract them. So QED definitely requires regularization. So C is out.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't involve quantum effects. So regularization techniques are quantum things. In classical electromagnetism, you don't have the same issues of divergent integrals because you're not doing quantum loop calculations. So in classical E&M, you don't need regularization. Because regularization is a way to handle infinities that come up in quantum theories.

So the question is which theory never requires regularization. Since regularization is part of quantum theories, the classical theories wouldn't need it. So option D, Classical Electrodynamics, doesn't require regularization because it's not a
