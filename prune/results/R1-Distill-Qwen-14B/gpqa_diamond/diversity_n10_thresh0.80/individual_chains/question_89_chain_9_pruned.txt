Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves several reactions and then analyzing the NMR of the final product. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, so the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane must have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbon atoms in this structure.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, usually an elimination occurs. Wait, but wait—since it's a dibromide, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Oh right, that's the E2 mechanism. So each Br would leave, and the base would abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since there are two bromines, perhaps two eliminations happen.

Wait, but wait—what's the structure here? Adamantane has a cage structure. If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, eliminating both would form a double bond between those carbons, right? So heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would give 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's more likely to form an allene or a diene? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure, but I think that elimination of two HBr molecules would form a double bond, leading to a diene. Wait, but in adamantane, the positions might not allow for a traditional diene because of the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridgehead elimination.

Wait, wait—another possibility. When dibromides undergo dehydrohalogenation, especially vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens), the reaction can form an alkene via elimination. So, in this case, KOH would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons where the Brs were. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene, but I'm not certain about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridged compound, maybe forming an annulene.

But wait, looking at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H),
