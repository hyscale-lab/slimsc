Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions. Hmm, I'll need to break down each step and see how each transformation affects the structure.

Alright, let's start by summarizing the information given.

The reaction scheme:
- Compound A reacts with HCN to give compound B.
- Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
- Compound C reacts with HNO2 to give compound D.
- Compound D, upon elimination of an inert gas, forms compound E.

The hints provided are:
a) Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR has a peak around 1715.

The options are A to D, all cyclic ketones with various substituents.

First, let's think about what each reaction does.

Starting with compound A. The IR peak at 1750 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone. So A is likely a cyclic ketone. When ketones react with HCN, they typically form cyanohydrins. So compound B would be a cyanohydrin.

Then, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation reaction. In the case of a cyanohydrin, which has a carbonyl group and an adjacent -CN group, hydrogenation would add hydrogen to the double bond (if any) or reduce the nitrile. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Wait, the cyanohydrin has a structure like R2C(OH)-CN. When you hydrogenate that, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to an amine (CH2NH2?), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in the cyanohydrin is being hydrogenated. Wait, wait, perhaps I should consider the structure of B.

Wait, maybe the cyanohydrin doesn't have a double bond. Let me think: when a ketone reacts with HCN, it adds across the carbonyl, so the product is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile adjacent. So for example, cyclopentanone plus HCN would give cyclopentane with an -OH and -CN attached to adjacent carbons. So structure of B would be something like that.

Then, when B is hydrogenated (H2, Pd), what happens? Well, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to an amine group. But wait, nitriles are typically reduced to amines with H2 and a catalyst like Pd. Alternatively, maybe the -CN becomes -CH2NH2, but I think more likely it becomes -CH2NH2 if it's a primary amine, but wait, in this scenario, the nitrile is attached to a carbon adjacent to an OH group. So upon hydrogenation, the CN becomes CH2NH2. But wait, that might not be the case because in the presence
