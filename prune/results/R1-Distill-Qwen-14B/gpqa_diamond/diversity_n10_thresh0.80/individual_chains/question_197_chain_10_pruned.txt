Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X has certain IR and NMR data and reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, let's recall what reaction conditions with red phosphorus and HI typically involve. I think that's a reaction to remove a protective group, maybe a hydroxyl group. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of certain groups, like the removal of a benzyl group or perhaps an elimination reaction. Alternatively, I remember that HI can act as a strong acid and a source of iodide ions, which can lead to various reactions, maybe even a substitution.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are known to be used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for removing carbonyl groups, right? Or wait, no, Wolff-Kishner uses hydrazine and heat. Maybe the reaction here is more about deprotection or some kind of elimination, especially since there's an IR and NMR given for the starting material.

Looking at the IR data of Compound X:

- The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. The broadness might suggest an O-H group. Then, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, like in a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest C=C aromatic rings (since these are around the ranges for aromatic C=C stretching).

So, putting that together, Compound X likely has an aromatic ring (from the NMR data, which I'll get to), a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1), and possibly an O-H group (3400–2500 cm-1). Wait, but the O-H could also be from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid? But the presence of a strong carbonyl might suggest a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 2500-3000, maybe even broader. But wait, in the IR given, the 3400–2500 is a range, so perhaps an O-H stretch, but I'm not sure if it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very high chemical shift. For protons, that region is typically for aldehydes (around 9-10 ppm) or carboxylic acids (which are usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak). The broad singlet suggests it's not split into multiple peaks, so maybe a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, some aldehydes can be around that region, but they're usually upfield compared to car
