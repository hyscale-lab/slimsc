Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods relate based on the given data. Let me think step by step.

Alright, so both stars have the same mass, same as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. Both orbits are circular. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The question gives the shift in the spectral line for each planet. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the radial velocity method detects the star's wobble. The Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for the Doppler shift is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. But since both stars are the same, maybe their velocities relate to the planet masses and orbital periods.

Wait, the velocity amplitude K is given by the Doppler shift. So K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star.

The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P * (1-e²)^(3/2)) ) )^(1/1) ) ) * (1/(1 + (M_planet/M_star)^(1/3))) ) Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to look at the simplified version.

Wait, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_planet << M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ (1) / ( P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ]^(1/1) ) * (1/(1 + (M_planet/M_star)^(1/3))) )

But since e is zero (they have circular orbits), the term (1 - e^2)^(3/2) is 1. So that term drops out.

Wait, I've seen another version of K. Let me think. Another formula I remember is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * ( (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So:

K ≈ (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Since both planets have the same mass and the same star mass, and assuming the same inclination (but since sin i is the same for both, maybe it's just a constant), the
