Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? And the question is about iron atoms being twice as excited in a specific energy level in star_1 compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which I think means that each small region of the photosphere behaves like a blackbody at a certain temperature. So the excitation of atoms in each star's photosphere depends on their respective temperatures.

I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T). Oh right, the formula is:

n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) )

But wait, in this problem, the excited level is higher than the ground state. So if E2 is higher than E1, then E2-E1 is positive. So the higher the temperature, the less the exponential term dampens that ratio. So higher temperatures make the ratio larger, meaning more excitation.

The problem says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So n1/n2 = 2. Wait, n1 would be the number in the higher level (excited) in star_1, and n2 in star_2. So n1/n2 = 2.

So using the Boltzmann equation:

n1/(n1') = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] 

Wait, n1 is the excited state in star_1, n2 is the same in star_2. So the ratio is n1/n2 = 2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Because n1 = N * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and n2 = N * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), where N is some constant for each star. So the ratio n1/n2 is [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T
