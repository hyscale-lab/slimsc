Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is usually a reagent for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no, that's actually H2O and HgSO4. Hmm. Oh wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is more about the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, maybe? Or wait, wait—another thought: I think red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride? Wait, no, that might be another reagent. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Oh right, when a nitrile is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it gets converted into an amine. But wait, could there be another reaction here?

Now, looking at the data given for Compound X: the IR and NMR spectra.

The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H or N-H stretch. But since it's in a certain range, maybe it's an -OH group. Also, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, perhaps Compound X has an aromatic ring with substituents, a carbonyl group, and possibly an -OH group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is likely an -OH proton. Maybe from a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde? But carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So that fits a -COOH group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet in the aromatic region. So maybe two protons adjacent to substituents on the ring. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggests another set of aromatic protons, but perhaps in a para-substituted position. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but could that be a substituent with another group?

Looking at the substituents: the aromatic peaks at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm as doublets. Maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has a carbonyl group. Let's think about the substituents.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Multiplet, perhaps a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, maybe a carbonyl. Or maybe a methylene group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe a CH2 group attached to another CH or something else.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, likely a CH3 group attached to a CH, so maybe it's a (CH2CH(CH3)2) group or something similar.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, which is probably a methyl group at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group. So maybe there's an ethyl chain attached somewhere.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think: the IR suggests a carbonyl group. The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, likely the -OH from a carboxylic acid. So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but
