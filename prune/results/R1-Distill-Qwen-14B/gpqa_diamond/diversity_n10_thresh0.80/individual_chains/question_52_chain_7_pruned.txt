Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and see what it's about. 

Alright, the question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When the spots aren't there, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so when the star isn't spotted (normal) compared to when it is spotted.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The ratio of populations of two energy levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations (n_i) is:

n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j are the energies of the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I think this wavelength relates to the energy difference between the levels. Let me calculate the energy difference from this wavelength.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. But wait, the energy difference between the two levels would be the energy of the photon emitted when an electron transitions from level 2 to level 1. So, E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Wait, but for the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is (E_i - E_j)/(k T). So if level 2 is higher than level 1, then E2 > E1, so E_i - E_j is positive if i is level 2 and j is level 1.

But in this case, the photon emitted when an electron drops from level 2 to level 1 is at 1448 Å. So the energy difference is hc/(1448e-10 m) approximately.

But wait, let me compute that. Let me get the constants:

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But wait, that's per photon. To get
