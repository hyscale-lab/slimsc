Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin in a particular direction is given by the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component Px, Py, Pz must correspond to the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz respectively.

Let me write down the given matrices:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The operator P is given along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is (nx, 0, nz), with nx and nz not both zero.

Wait, the operator for the spin along direction n would be P = (n·σ) * ħ/2. So P = (nx σx + nz σz) * ħ/2.

So the operator matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ].

Wait, because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when multiplied by nx and nz respectively, and added together:

σx * nx: [[0, nx], [nx, 0]]
σz * nz: [[nz, 0], [0, -nz]]
Adding them gives [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

So P is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

So the operator P is (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvector equation: P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So let's set up the matrix equation.

Let me represent the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b]. Then,
