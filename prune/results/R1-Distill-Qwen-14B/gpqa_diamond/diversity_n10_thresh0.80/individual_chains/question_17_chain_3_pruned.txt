Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. So, the Ca-EDTA complex would be like a big molecule where EDTA is bound to calcium.

The problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Oh, right, formation constants (Kf) are the equilibrium constants for the formation of a complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²- (or similar charge, but the exact formula might not matter here).

Wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So even though the Ca-EDTA is present, some of it might dissociate, releasing Ca²+ ions back into the solution. But wait, no, wait. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, and assuming it's all complexed, then under ideal conditions (since the pH is ideal), the complex is fully formed. But that doesn't make sense because even strong complexes can have some dissociation. Or does this situation assume that all the calcium is tied up in the complex?

Wait, no, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is in solution, and Kf is the formation constant. So the dissociation would be,
