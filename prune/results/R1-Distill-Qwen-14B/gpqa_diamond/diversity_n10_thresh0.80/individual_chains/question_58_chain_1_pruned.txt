Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These divergences are a problem because they make the theory predictions impossible. So regularization is a way to handle those infinities by introducing a cutoff or some other method, and then you renormalize to get finite, physical results.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires this. So which of these theories doesn't have these kinds of divergences that need regularization?

Let's think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. In classical electromagnetism, like Maxwell's equations, do we have issues with divergences? Well, in classical theories, infinities can come up, like the self-energy of a charge or the infinite charge density at a point charge. But in classical physics, those are handled differently, perhaps by considering distributions or other models. But wait, in the context of regularization, which is a quantum field theory technique, maybe classical theories don't require it. So maybe option D is the one.

But let me think about the other options first.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD does require renormalization because calculations lead to divergences. But isn't QCD asymptotically free? That means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, so perturbative methods work. But even so, you still have to deal with renormalization. So QCD definitely requires regularization and renormalization steps. So option B is out.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism in quantum terms. I remember that QED has a lot of renormalization because of the divergences. For example, when calculating the electron self-energy, you get divergent integrals. So you need to regularize them, maybe using methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc. So QED does require regularization. So option C isn't the correct answer.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a
