Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy here must be related to the kinetic energy of the ion. But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether it's total energy or kinetic energy. Oh right, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy per particle, but sometimes it's the total energy. I think RHIC's energy is given as the total energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe I should just think in terms of relativistic energy equations.

The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me figure out its mass. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So it's Li-6. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be approximated, but I'm not sure of the exact value. Alternatively, I can think of it as a collection of nucleons. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 6 nucleons, so 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, that's just the rest mass. The actual mass might be a bit different because of binding energy, but maybe for this problem, we can approximate it as 6 nucleons each with 938 MeV.

Wait, but wait another thing. The mass of the nucleus isn't exactly the sum of the masses of its nucleons because of the mass defect due to binding energy. However, since the binding energy is much smaller than the rest mass (on the order of a few MeV per nucleon), maybe for an approximate calculation, using 6 * 938 MeV is sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps the exact mass isn't needed because the problem provides the options, and the calculation might be more straightforward.

But maybe it's better to calculate the rest mass using the known value. Let me check my memory: The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 * 1.0087 atomic mass units (since each nucleon is about 1.0087 u). Wait, no, wait. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 6 nucleons, each about 1.0087 u? Wait, no. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. Then multiply by 931.5 MeV/u to get the rest mass
