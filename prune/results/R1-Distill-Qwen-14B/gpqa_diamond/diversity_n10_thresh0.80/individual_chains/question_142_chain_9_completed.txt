Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is ½ times (|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. Pure states are like single vectors in the Hilbert space, while mixed states are statistical ensembles of pure states.

Wait, the given ρ looks familiar. Let me write it out. The density matrix is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So that's actually a diagonal matrix with ½ on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Oh right, because |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the top left, and |1><1| has 1 in the bottom right.

So the density matrix ρ would look like:
[ [0.5, 0],
  [0, 0.5] ]

I think this represents a completely mixed state in a single qubit system. Because a pure state like |0><0| would have a density matrix with 1 in the top left and 0 elsewhere, and similarly for |1>. But this is an equal mixture of both, so it's a maximally mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that means exactly. I remember that for qubits, the state can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, using the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the Bloch sphere! That's right. Each qubit state can be represented as a vector (x, y, z) on or inside the Bloch sphere. For a pure state, the vector lies on the surface, and for a mixed state, it's inside.

The general form of a single qubit density matrix is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. When r is zero, you get the maximally mixed state because it becomes ρ = I/2.

Wait, let me write that out more clearly. The identity matrix I for 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]], which is exactly the ρ given in the problem. So the vector r must be zero in this case. Because:

ρ = (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

So the point r in the Bloch sphere would be (0,0,0). That's the origin, the center of the sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Another way to think about it: the density matrix can also be written as a vector in the Bloch sphere via the relation ρ = (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. Comparing this to our given ρ, which is I/2, the coefficients x, y, z must all be zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

So yes, the geometrical position is the origin. So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right),
\]

which simplifies to a diagonal matrix:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is a vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), we see that the off-diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are zero, and the diagonal terms match \(\frac{I}{2}\). This implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
