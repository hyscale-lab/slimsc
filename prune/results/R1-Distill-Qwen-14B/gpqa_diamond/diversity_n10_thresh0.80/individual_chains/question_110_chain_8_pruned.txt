Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the key here is the apparent magnitude of the stars because each spectrograph has different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go down to 16.5 mag. So the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16.5 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star has V magnitude brighter than 17, that means V is less than 17, right? So stars with V mag ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V ≤16.5.

Wait, wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" — so brighter than 17 in V. Since lower V is brighter, that's all stars with V <17. So the limit is 17 mag for ESPRESSO, and 16.5 for HIRES.

So any star that has apparent V magnitude ≤16.5 can be seen
