Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh wait, the operator components are given for P_x, P_y, and P_z.

The problem gives me the components of each P (x, y, z) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector for the operator P. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, I think the operator P is the vector sum of its components. So P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, but wait, each component is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix. So maybe each P component is (ħ/2) times their respective Pauli matrices.

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices are usually:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which matches the given matrices in the problem. So P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, and P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z.

The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ) because it's in the x-z plane (so y-component is zero). But wait, the direction is arbitrary, but they say n lies in the x-z plane. So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, no, wait. The operator is P, which for any direction is the sum of the components times the direction's components. So if the direction is n, then P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But in our case, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y = 0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But n_x and n_z are components of a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

Wait, but the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) where n_x and n_z are such that n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So for example, if the direction is along x, n_z=0, or along z, n_x=0.

But the problem is to find the eigenvector for this general P. So the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and the eigenvector would have to satisfy (P - (ħ/2) I)|ψ> = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the spin-1/2 system. The operator P is along direction n in x-z plane. So P is proportional to the Pauli matrix in that direction.

Wait, in that case, the eigenstates would be the spin-up and spin-down states
