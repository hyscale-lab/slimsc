Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii and masses are both 1.5 times larger for Star_1 compared to Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Also, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming both are black bodies.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but we know that the stars' brightest wavelengths are the same. That probably relates to their temperatures. Oh right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

So if they have the same λ_max, T1 = T2. That makes things easier because temperature is the same for both.

So for luminosity, L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1²)/(R2²). Because R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1 = 1.5 R2.

Plugging that in, ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2.

Wait, but wait a second. The question mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed luminosity?

Ah, because of the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect changes the observed wavelength due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. But wait, luminosity is an intrinsic property. Oh, but when we calculate the observed flux, the Doppler shift might affect the observed brightness because of the change in wavelength (redshift or blueshift).

Wait, no. The luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, but the observed flux depends on distance and the Doppler effect. But wait, the question says they computed the luminosity assuming black bodies. So maybe the Doppler effect affects the observed temperature, which could affect the calculation of luminosity.

Wait, let me think. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and moving away would be redshifted. The observed wavelength is affected. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength would be different. But how does this tie into the calculation of luminosity?

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is the same. But their actual λ_max (emitted) would be different because of the Doppler shift. So the observed λ_max is the same, which is given.

Wait, but the calculation of luminosity would depend on the actual temperature of the star, not the observed temperature, right? Because the stars' own temperatures determine their luminosity.

Hmm, but how does the Doppler shift affect the calculation here? Let me think. The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler factor. So, if a star emits a peak wavelength λ_em, and it's moving with velocity v relative to us, the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_em * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), I think. Or wait, is it (1 + v/c) for moving away? Or the other way around. Let me get that right.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength: λ_obs = λ_em * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when moving away, but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, I've heard the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_em (1 + v/c) for non-relativistic speeds. But v here is 700 km/s, which is about 0.2% the speed of light (since c is about 3e5 km/s). So maybe the approximation holds.

But wait, the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So, for Star_1, v1 is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_em1 (since when v=0, λ_obs = λ_em). For Star_2, v = 700 km/s, so λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 + v2/c), but wait, since it's moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted), so maybe it's (1 + v/c). But if the star is moving away, observed wavelength is longer. Wait, the question says Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Radial velocity is positive when moving away, I think. So Star_2 is moving away, which would cause its observed wavelength to be longer. But in the problem, both observed λ_max are the same. So let's write the equations.

Let me denote:

λ_obs1 = λ_em1 [since v1=0]

λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 + v2/c) [assuming non-relativistic, and moving away]

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, λ_em1 = λ_em2 * (1 + v2/c).

But wait, according to Wien's law, λ_em = b / T. So λ_em1 = b / T1, λ_em2 = b / T2.

So from earlier, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ_em1 = λ_em2 * (1 + v2/c)

Substituting λ_em expressions:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the Doppler shift direction. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v/c). But the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. Star_1 is not moving, so λ_obs1 = λ_em1. Star_2 is moving away, so λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 + v2/c ). Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_em1 = λ_em2 * (1 + v2/c ). So earlier equation.

But from Wien's law, λ_em = b / T → λ_em1 = (b / T1 ), λ_em2 = (b / T2 ). So substituting,

(b/T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

→ (1/T1) = (1/T2)(1 + v2/c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

Hmm. So T1 is less than T2 because (1 + v2/c ) is greater than 1. So that would mean that Star_1's temperature is lower than Star_2's, which seems counterintuitive because Star_1 is larger and the same observed brightness. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies, and the astronomers computed the luminosity based on that. So the computed luminosity would depend on the actual temperature, not the observed. Because when you calculate luminosity using black body radiation, you use the emitted temperature, not the observed.

Wait, but the observed λ_max is the same. So the astronomers would have used the observed λ_max to compute the temperature, right? Because they can't see the actual emitted wavelength. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, but the star's actual temperature is different from the observed one. So if the observed λ_max is the same for both, but the stars' actual temperatures are different because of their velocities. Because Star_1 is at rest, so its λ_em = λ_obs. Star_2 is moving away, so its λ_obs is longer than λ_em. So when astronomers compute the temperature, they would use λ_obs, so T_obs = b / λ_obs. But the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher than T_obs because when the star emits λ_em = b / T2, but due to moving away, λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v/c), so T_obs = (1/(λ_em (1 + v/c)) ) * b = T2 / (1 + v/c ). So the observed temperature is less than the actual temperature by a factor of (1 + v/c ).

Wait, so the astronomers would compute T1 as b/λ_obs1 = b/(λ_em1) = T1_actual. And T2 as (b/λ_obs2) = (b/(λ_em2*(1 + v/c))) ) = (b/λ_em2 ) / (1 + v/c ) = T2_actual / (1 + v/c ).

But when computing the luminosity using the black body formula, the astronomers would use the observed temperature? Or the actual temperature? Hmm, I think they would use the observed temperature, because that's what they measure.

Wait, but the problem states that they computed the luminosity as if the stars are black bodies. So perhaps they used the observed λ_max to compute the temperature, which would lead them to an incorrect temperature for Star_2.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosities based on the black body assumption. So they would have taken the observed λ_max, calculated the temperatures, and then used those temperatures to compute luminosity.

Wait, but that's not correct because the observed λ_max is shifted. So the actual temperature is higher for Star_2, but the observed λ_max would make it seem cooler.

Wait, let me think again. Let me model this step by step.

1. Star_1: R1 = 1.5 R2, M1 = 1.5 M2. Radial velocity v1 = 0.

2. Star_2: R2 is its radius, M2 is its mass. Radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s.

3. Observed λ_max for both stars is the same, say λ_obs.

4. The astronomers calculate the luminosity using each star's R and the observed λ_max (since they can't see the actual λ_em due to Doppler shift).

So for Star_1: T1 (observed) = b / λ_obs.

For Star_2: T2 (observed) = b / λ_obs.

But the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher because it's moving away. Because the observed λ_obs is longer than the emitted λ_em. So Star_2's actual temperature is T2_actual = (b / λ_em2 ) = (b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) ) ) = (b λ_obs ) / (λ_obs ) * (1 + v2/c ) → T2_actual = T_observed * (1 + v2/c ). So T2_actual = T1_observed * (1 + v2/c ).

Wait, wait, let's see:

λ_em2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v2/c ) → because λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v/c ), so λ_em = λ_obs / (1 + v/c )

So T2_actual = b / λ_em2 = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c )) ) = (b (1 + v2/c )) / λ_obs = (1 + v2/c ) * (b / λ_obs ) = (1 + v2/c ) * T_observed.

So T2_actual is higher than T_observed by a factor of (1 + v2/c ).

But the astronomers, when calculating the luminosity, would take T_observed for both stars because that's what they measure from the observed λ_max. So L1 would be calculated as 4π R1² σ T_obs^4.

L2 would be 4π R2² σ T_obs^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 (computed) would be (R1² / R2² ) * (T_obs^4 / T_obs^4 ) = ( (1.5 R2 )² ) / ( R2² ) ) = (2.25 R2² ) / R2² = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2.

But wait, that can't be correct because the actual luminosity of Star_2 would be higher because its actual T is higher, but the astronomers are using the observed T, which is lower than the actual T.

Wait, but the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So the computed luminosity, based on observed data, including the Doppler effect, would be as I said before, 2.25 times.

But wait, let me think again. Because when a star is moving away, its light is redshifted, which makes it appear cooler than it actually is. So the astronomers, using the observed λ_max, think that Star_2 is cooler than it actually is. So when they calculate T_obs, they think T2 is lower. But the actual T2 is higher.

Wait, but the problem says that both stars' observed λ_max are the same. So in their data, both stars appear to emit most strongly at the same λ. So they take that to imply that both have the same temperature. But the reality is that Star_2 is moving away, so its emitted λ_max is shorter (since T_actual is higher), but because of the redshift, the observed λ_max increases to match Star_1's.

So in their calculation, the astronomers think that both stars have the same temperature. So when they compute luminosity, they use T = b / λ_obs for both.

So the computed luminosity for Star_1 is L1 = 4π R1² σ (b/λ_obs )^4.

Similarly, L2 =4π R2² σ (b/λ_obs )^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² / R2² ) = ( (1.5 R2 )² ) / ( R2² ) = 2.25.

So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, the options don't have A as 2.25. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Yes, option A is ~2.25. So the answer should be A.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the Doppler effect on luminosity. Because Doppler shift can affect the observed flux, which depends on the observed luminosity and the redshift.

Wait, wait. The actual luminosity is intrinsic, but the observed flux is affected by redshift. But in the problem, the question is about the computed luminosity. So if the astronomers are using the observed data, including the redshift, how does that affect their calculation.

Wait, let me think. The luminosity is intrinsic, but when you calculate it from observed quantities, you have to account for the fact that the observed flux has been affected by the Doppler shift. So when you compute the luminosity using the observed flux, you have to apply a correction for the redshift.

Wait, the flux F is related to the luminosity L by F = L / (4π d² ), where d is the distance. But when there's a redshift, the observed flux is also affected. The observed flux F_obs is F_emit / ( (1 + z )^2 ), where z is the redshift. Because the photon energies are lower (redshifted) and the photon arrival rate is also reduced.

But in this problem, the stars are at the same distance? Or is that not given? Wait, the problem doesn't state anything about the distance. So perhaps I can't assume they're at the same distance.

Wait, but the problem is about the luminosity ratio, which is an intrinsic property. So if the stars are at different distances, the flux would be different, but their intrinsic luminosities would still be as computed.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to approach this differently.

The actual luminosity of a star is given by L = 4πR² σ T^4. The observed flux from a star is F = L / (4π d² ), where d is the distance. But when there's a Doppler shift due to velocity, the observed flux is affected. The observed flux is F_obs = F_emit * (1 + z )^{-1}, where z is the redshift. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the factors here.

Alternatively, the Doppler effect changes the observed wavelength and frequency. The flux is the energy per unit area per unit time. The observed flux is F_obs = F_emit * ( (1 + z )^{-1} )^4 * (1/(1 + z )) ), or something like that. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy per photon and the rate of photons.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about how the flux changes when there's a Doppler shift. The flux F is proportional to the energy of the photons multiplied by the number of photons per second. So if the star is moving away, each photon has lower energy (E=hc/λ), and the number of photons per second observed is reduced because the time between arrivals is stretched (due to the source moving away).

The number of photons per second observed is n_obs = n_emit / (1 + z ), where z is the redshift (z = v/c for small z). The energy of each photon is E_obs = E_emit / (1 + z ). So the observed flux F_obs = n_obs * E_obs = (n_emit / (1 + z )) ) * (E_emit / (1 + z )) = F_emit / (1 + z )^2.

But F_emit is the emitted flux, which is L/(4π d² ). So F_obs = L/(4π d² (1 + z )^2 ).

But wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosities using black body radiation. So perhaps they calculated L based on the observed flux and the observed wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the Doppler effect affects the observed temperature, which in turn affects the calculation of luminosity.

Wait, the problem statement says: the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of... So the computed luminosity, considering the Doppler shift, would be different from the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, and the astronomers computed the luminosity based on that. So they would have used the observed temperature (from the observed λ_max) to compute the luminosity.

Wait, but earlier I thought that because the observed λ_max are the same, the observed temperatures are the same, so the computed luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, so option A.

But why are the other options present? Are they considering other effects, like the Doppler effect on the observed flux, which affects the calculation of luminosity?

Wait, perhaps I should model the observed flux and how the luminosity is calculated from it.

Wait, the flux F_obs is what we observe. The flux is F_obs = (L / (4π d² )) * (1/(1 + z ))^2. Because each photon's energy is reduced by 1/(1 + z ), and the number of photons per second is also reduced by 1/(1 + z ), so flux, which is energy per area per time, is reduced by 1/(1 + z )^2.

But when the astronomers calculate the luminosity, they would use the observed flux and some distance. But since the problem doesn't mention distance, perhaps they assume that both stars are at the same distance. Or maybe it's not necessary.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state that the stars are at the same distance. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the effect of the Doppler shift on the temperature measurement, and thus on the calculation of luminosity, without considering flux.

Wait, let me recap. The astronomers are calculating the luminosity using the black body formula. So they must have used the observed wavelength (λ_max) to compute the temperature, which then is used in L = 4π R² σ T^4.

But because Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer, implying a lower observed temperature. So when the astronomers compute the luminosity for Star_2, they use a lower T than the actual T, which would make their computed luminosity lower than the actual.

But the problem says that they found the same λ_max, so they think both stars have the same T. But in reality, Star_2 is hotter, so its actual luminosity would be higher.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the computed luminosity. So the computed luminosity by the astronomers would be based on the observed data, which for Star_2 would have a lower T, but larger R. So let's compute that.

So Star_1's computed T1 = b/λ_obs.

Star_2's computed T2 = b/λ_obs → same as T1.

So L1_computed = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2_computed = 4π R2² σ T2^4 = 4π R2² σ T1^4.

So L1_computed / L2_computed = (R1² / R2² ) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So the answer should be A.

But the options have option D as ~2.23, which is close to 2.25. But 2.25 is exactly option A.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor due to the Doppler effect on the radius or something else.

Wait, another approach: Since the observed λ_max is same, but Star_2 is moving away.

The actual temperature of Star_2 is higher, but the observed T is lower.

So the computed luminosity would be based on the observed T, so L2_computed = 4π (R2)^2 σ (T_obs)^4.

But the actual luminosity of Star_2 is L2_actual = 4π R2^2 σ (T2_actual)^4.

But the problem is talking about the computed luminosity, which is based on observed T.

So the computed L1 is 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ (T_obs)^4 = 4π R2^2 (2.25) σ T_obs^4.

Computed L2 is 4π R2^2 σ T_obs^4.

So L1_computed / L2_computed = 2.25.

But wait, perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed radius? Because the star's surface might appear contracted or expanded due to motion. But I don't think that's the case here. The radius used in the calculation is the actual radius, not the apparent size. Because when calculating luminosity, you use the actual radius, not the angular size.

So the radius used in the calculation is the actual radius, which is R1 = 1.5 R2.

So the computed luminosity ratio is 2.25.

But why are the options not exactly 2.25? Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So option A is exactly 2.25, which seems correct. So the correct answer should be A.

But wait, another thought: maybe the luminosity calculation also considers the Doppler effect on the flux. Because the observed flux is F = L/(4π d²) * (1/(1+z))².

So if the astronomers compute the luminosity as L = 4π d² F_obs (1 + z )², then for Star_2, L2_computed would be L2_intrinsic * (1 + z )².

Wait, but how would the astronomers know the distance d? They probably don't, but perhaps they assume both stars are at the same distance. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the Doppler effect on the temperature, not the flux.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to structure this.

The problem states that the astronomers are computing luminosities assuming black body radiation. So they must be using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4π R² σ T^4.

But their T is based on the observed λ_max. So for Star_2, because it's moving away, the observed λ_max is longer, so they think T is lower than actual.

So their computed T for Star_2 is T2_computed = T_obs.

But the actual T2_actual = T_obs * (1 + v2/c ) ≈ T_obs * (1 + 0.0007) ≈ 1.0007 T_obs.

So the actual L2 is higher.

But the problem is about the computed luminosity, not the actual. So the computed L is based on R and T computed from observed λ_max.

So L1_computed = 4π (1.5 R2 )^2 σ (T_obs )^4.

L2_computed = 4π R2^2 σ (T_obs )^4.

Ratio: ( (1.5)^2 R2^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) ) = 2.25.

So the computed luminosity ratio is 2.25.

Therefore, the answer should be option A.


The problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with Star_1 having a radius and mass 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 is stationary. The goal is to determine the factor by which the computed luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, assuming the stars radiate as black bodies.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Luminosity Formula**: The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   \[
   L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]

2. **Observed Wavelengths and Temperatures**: The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\)), the observed temperatures are the same:
   \[
   T_{\text{obs,1}} = T_{\text{obs,2}}
   \]
   However, Star_2's actual temperature is higher due to its radial velocity of 700 km/s (redshift). The relationship between the observed and actual temperatures is:
   \[
   T_{\text{actual,2}} = T_{\text{obs,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
   \]
   where \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c\) is the speed of light. For small velocities (\(v_2/c \ll 1\)), this correction is minimal.

3. **Computed Luminosity**: The astronomers compute the luminosities using the observed data, including the observed temperature (\(T_{\text{obs}}\)) and the actual radius (\(R\)). Since the observed temperatures are the same, the temperature term cancels out in the luminosity ratio:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2}
   \]
   Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\):
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{1.5 R_2}{R_2}\right)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25
   \]

4. **Doppler Effect Consideration**: While the Doppler effect alters the observed wavelengths and temperatures, the computed luminosities are based on the observed data. Since the observed temperatures are the same, the Doppler effect does not change the computed luminosity ratio.

### Conclusion:
The computed luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of **2.25**, which corresponds to option A.

ANSWER: A
