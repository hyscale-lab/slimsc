Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the electric field outside a spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me read it again.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small cavity inside it, radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s from the conductor's center. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is its distance from the cavity's center. Also, l and L are bigger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are all expressions for E. I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Let me think... When a conductor is neutral, putting a charge inside a cavity induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, right? So when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must develop an induced charge of -q, because the conductor was neutral. Then, the outer surface would have a charge +q to balance it out.

But wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge is zero. Oh no, wait. If the conductor was uncharged, then the sum of the inner and outer induced charges should be zero. So when you add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor gets -q, and the outer surface gets +q, right? Because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral. Or wait, no, the conductor was uncharged, so adding +q inside the cavity would cause the inner surface to have -q, and the conductor as a whole gains +q. But wait, no, because the conductor was initially neutral. So maybe the outer surface must have +q, making the total conductor charge +q. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The conductor was initially uncharged (total charge zero). When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the charge inside the cavity attracts opposite charges. So the inner surface is -q. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge
