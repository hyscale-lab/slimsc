Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let's see what the question says. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different set of reagents.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to visualize the structures. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The ethynyl group is like a triple bond connected to another carbon, so it's CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane.

The target compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, on the same carbon (the 1-position), there's a substituent which is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to a hydroxy group, and that methyl is connected to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this out mentally. The substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl. So the carbon where the substituent is attached is also the one with the aldehyde group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a CHO group on one carbon and a CH(OH) connected to a cyclohexyl group on the same carbon.

So how do we get from ethynylcyclohexane to this structure? Let's think about the steps involved.

Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. To form the aldehyde group, maybe we can do some kind of oxidation. But wait, ethynyl groups can be converted to aldehydes under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps adding functional groups step by step.

Let me think about the possible reactions. Triple bonds can undergo hydration to form either alkenes or ketones, depending on the reagents. For example, with H2O and a catalyst like mercury(II) sulfate in sulfuric acid, it's a hydration to form a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond between two carbons attached to the cyclohexane. So the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So it's CH2-C≡CH attached to the ring?

Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane would have the structure cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is -C≡CH. Oh wait, no: ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, that would be propargylcyclohexane. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, ethynyl is a substituent where the cyclohexane is connected to a carbon that's triple bonded to another carbon. So it's cyclohexane with a substituent like -C≡CH, which is ethynyl.

So perhaps the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Wait, but ethynyl is -C≡CH, so yes, that's correct.

So the starting material is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached: cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Now, the target has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane ring and a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group on the same carbon.

Hmm. Let me think about the possible reactions. I remember that triple bonds can be converted to aldehydes via oxymercuration or other methods. Alternatively, maybe we can do a hydration of the alkyne to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but the triple bond is between two carbons, so when you hydrate an alkyne, it typically gives a ketone if it's a terminal alkyne. Wait, no, wait: terminal alkynes (like ethynyl) when hydrated under certain conditions can form either aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. A terminal alkyne (like R-C≡CH) when treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration) would typically form a ketone if there's a suitable leaving group. Wait, no, for hydration of alkynes, I think the usual process is that a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH) when treated with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (which is a typical oxymercuration condition) would form a ketone if it's a non-terminal alkyne. Wait, no, wait: wait, no, I think terminal alkynes upon hydration give aldehydes, while internal alkynes give ketones.

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Let me get this straight.

Oxymercuration of alkynes: Mercury(II) sulfate and sulfuric acid. For alkynes, this is a hydration reaction. For terminal alkynes (R-C≡CH), oxymercuration leads to the formation of a ketone, not an aldehyde. Because the triple bond is between the sp-hybridized carbons. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Actually, when a terminal alkyne is treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4, it adds water across the triple bond, forming a ketone. Because the triple bond is R-C≡CH, and upon hydration, it becomes R-C(OH)-CH3, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the hydration would lead to R-C(OH)-CH2-OH? Or perhaps R-C(O)H. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, another approach: maybe we can convert the alkyne into a vinylic group, then perform some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So, maybe we need to add a cyclohexyl group somewhere.

Let me think about the steps. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps we can perform a series of reactions to introduce the necessary groups.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)-cyclohexyl) and a formyl group (CHO) on the same carbon. So, perhaps the carbon that was the alkyne's carbon becomes the CHO group, and the adjacent carbon becomes the CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone first, and then a Grignard reagent is added to introduce the cyclohexyl group. But that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. Wait, can you oxidize an alkyne to an aldehyde? I'm not sure. I know that ozonolysis of alkynes can give diketones or other products, but I'm not certain about that.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the possible reagents in the options.

Looking at the options, they include things like NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, Li/liq. NH3, O3, (CH3)2S, NH4OH.

Hmm. So NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl, which is a methylating agent. H2/Pd is hydrogenation catalyst, probably for reducing triple bonds or ketones. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxide opening. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are typical for oxymercuration. Li and liquid NH3 is a Birch reduction or for elimination reactions. O3 is ozone, used in ozonolysis. (CH3)2S is a reductive workup agent, like in the workup after ozonolysis. NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, used in various reactions like hydrolysis.

So, let's think about each option step by step.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. When used with an alkyl halide, perhaps it's an alkylation. But ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would form the acetylide. Then adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, giving a longer alkyne.

Wait, so step 1 would convert the terminal alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) to a longer alkyne, maybe by deprotonation and alkylation. For example, cyclohexane-C≡CH would become cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 after treatment with NaNH2 and CH3Cl.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkane. So cyclohexane-C-C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond would add H2 across it, turning it into a single bond. So, the alkyne R-C≡C-R' would become R-CH2-CH2-R' after hydrogenation.

Wait, but the starting material after step 1 is R-C≡C-CH3. So step 2 would hydrogenate it to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the cyclohexane would have an ethyl group attached as CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the starting material after step 1 is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So after hydrogenation, it would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's not helpful for forming a carbonyl group.

Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's for elimination, but that seems unlikely here. Ba(OH)2 is often used for epoxide ring opening or for elimination in some cases. Alternatively, maybe it's a saponification, but that's for esters. Not sure.

Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the oxymercuration condition, which typically adds water across a triple bond to form a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, the triple bond has been hydrogenated already in step 2. So maybe step 4 is not applicable. So option A doesn't seem right.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; O3; NH4OH.

So step 1: NaNH2 (deprotonate alkyne) + ethyl chloride. So the ethynyl group would become R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Li in liquid NH3 is used for Birch reductions, which reduce aromatic rings, but maybe it's used here for elimination. Alternatively, it could be a deprotonation. If the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH2CH3, then treating with Li in NH3 might lead to some reaction. Wait, perhaps it's a deprotonation of a terminal alkyne, but in this case, the alkyne is not terminal anymore—it's internal. So maybe it's for elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation and then elimination, but I'm not so sure. Then step 3 is O3, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. Wait, but up to step 2, we have an alkyne. Ozonolysis isn't typically used on alkynes; it's for alkenes. So maybe this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, maybe after step 2, the alkyne is converted to an alkene. How? Well, perhaps via dehydrohalogenation. But I'm not seeing that clearly. Maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Breaking it down: step 1 is alkylation of the alkyne. So starting with ethynylcyclohexane, after step 1, we have cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 with Pd-CaCO3 catalyst. That would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. So that's a 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane or similar?

Wait, no, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is ethylcyclohexane. Then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used on alkenes, but here we have an alkane. So that doesn't make sense. Unless step 2 didn't hydrogenate completely, which I don't think is the case. So this option probably isn't correct.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a methylating agent? Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but NaNH2 in methanol would deprotonate something. Wait, if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which has acidic protons on the triple bond. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would give the acetylide: cyclohexane-C≡C^- + NH2^-.

Then adding methanol (CH3OH) would result in alkylation? Wait, but methanol is not a good alkylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with MeOH, leading to the formation of a methyl ether. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide (cyclohexane-C≡C^-) would attack the CH3O- from MeOH, leading to cyclohexane-C≡C-OCH3. But that doesn't fit into the target structure.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for Birch reduction, but the current compound after step 1 is an ether with a triple bond. Maybe Birch reduction would reduce the aromatic ring, but in this case, the ring is cyclohexane, which is saturated. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation to form a stronger base.

Wait, maybe after step 1, the compound is R-C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2: reaction with Li in NH3. Could this lead to elimination? Perhaps forming an alkyne again, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is used to deprotonate something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a method to form a Grignard reagent, but that typically requires Mg.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see a halogen here.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting off track. Let me think about the target structure again.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group to the same carbon that has the aldehyde group.

So, perhaps the alkyne needs to be converted into a carbonyl group, and then a cyclohexyl group added as a substituent.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted to a ketone via hydration. Then, a Grignard reagent is added to introduce a cyclohexyl group. But where?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group first, and then some kind of addition occurs.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group and a hydroxyl group on adjacent carbons. So, perhaps we can form a diol from a dihydroxylation of a double bond, but that doesn't directly fit.

Let me think of the possible steps again.

We have ethynylcyclohexane. Let's say we first deprotonate to form the acetylide (using NaNH2) and then alkylate it. Then, perhaps hydrogenate to get a longer chain, then introduce a carbonyl group.

Wait, but looking at the target, the aldehyde is on the same carbon as the hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, and then a cyclohexyl group is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, and then the ketone is subjected to some kind of cyclohexyl addition.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a methyl group, and then some reaction adds both the formyl and the hydroxymethyl groups.

Wait, perhaps via a Grignard reaction. Let's think: If the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl magnesium bromide) could add to it.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think step by step.

First, let's consider the target structure again. We have a cyclohexane ring. At one position, there's a CHO group. At the same carbon, there's a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group.

Wait, does this mean that this carbon is attached to both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group? So the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a CH group, where this CH has an OH group and is connected to a cyclohexyl group, and also has a CHO group. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because a carbon can't have four bonds. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is:

The cyclohexane ring has a substituent which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and the same carbon also has a CHO group. So the structure would be:

R-C(=O)H and R-OH and R-cyclohexyl all on the same carbon? No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the target structure.

Wait, the compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is cyclohexane with a formyl group. Then, on the same carbon as the formyl group, there's a substituent which is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So the substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl.

So the structure is:

The cyclohexane ring has a formyl group (CHO) on carbon 1. Also on carbon 1, there's a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group attached. So carbon 1 has bonds to the ring, CHO, CH(OH)-cyclohexyl, and another bond (maybe hydrogen, but perhaps it's a quaternary center).

Wait, but that would require the carbon to have four bonds: ring, CHO, CH(OH) cyclohexyl, and another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH(OH)cyclohexyl), attached to the same carbon as the CHO group.

So the carbon is connected to the cyclohexane ring, the CHO group, and a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group. That makes four bonds, so that's possible.

So, the first step is to convert the ethynyl group into a carbonyl. Then, add a cyclohexyl group with a hydroxymethyl substituent.

Hmm. Let me think of a possible synthesis pathway.

1. Convert the ethynylcyclohexane into a ketone. This can be done via hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (oxymercuration). So, R-C≡CH → R-C(OH)-CH3. But that would give a ketone because the triple bond is R-C≡CH, so hydration gives R-C(OH)-CH3, which is a ketone.

2. Then, perhaps a Grignard reagent is added to this ketone. But Grignard reagents typically add to ketones, giving secondary alcohols. However, in this case, we need to introduce a cyclohexyl group with a hydroxymethyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps after converting the alkyne to a ketone, we perform a nucleophilic addition. But for that, perhaps the ketone is first converted into a better electrophile.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is subjected to a conjugate addition.

Wait, but perhaps after forming the ketone, we can perform a Grignard reaction. For example, adding a Grignard reagent like cyclohexyl magnesium bromide to the ketone. However, the Grignard would add to the ketone, giving an alcohol. But we need an additional step to form the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is first converted into a bromide, and then a nucleophilic substitution occurs with a cyclohexanol or some other nucleophile. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the target can be built through a series of alkyne modifications and elimination reactions.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed by oxidizing a secondary alcohol. And the secondary alcohol is formed via a Grignard addition to a ketone.

Let me outline a possible pathway:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2 → acetylide.

Step 2: Alkylation of the acetylide with methyl chloride → cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 3: Hydrogenate the triple bond to get cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 (ethylcyclohexane?).

Wait, but that doesn't help with forming the aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, maybe after alkylation, the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, perhaps after the alkylation (step 1 and 2), the triple bond is subjected to oxymercuration to form a ketone. Let me think.

Wait, the steps in option D are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

After step 1: the alkyne is converted to acetylide and then perhaps quenched with methanol to form an ether? Like R-OCH3. Then step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe it's a Birch reduction, but cyclohexane rings are usually resistant to Birch. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonation to form a stronger base.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is for dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see a halogen here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is used to eliminate, forming a double bond.

Wait, maybe the first two steps convert the alkyne into an alkene.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base, and in the presence of an alkyl halide, it can perform alkylation of the acetylide. So step 1 in option D is NaNH2 and methanol. So the acetylide (R-C≡C^-) would react with methanol. But methanol is not a good electrophile for alkylation unless it's an SN2 reaction. Alternatively, maybe the acetylide attacks the methanol, leading to R-C≡C-OCH3.

Then step 2: Li in NH3. Could this lead to elimination, forming a triple bond again? Or perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Looking at the target, the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituent is also at position 1. So the synthesis would need to form both groups on the same carbon.

Perhaps the alkyne is first oxidized to a carbonyl group. Then, a Grignard reagent is added to that carbonyl, introducing the cyclohexyl group with a hydroxymethyl substituent. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then treated with a Grignard reagent, which would add to the carbonyl, forming an alcohol. Then, further oxidation would form the aldehyde.

Wait, let's think:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → convert to ketone (using HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O) → cyclohexanecarbinone (R-C(O)-CH3).

Step 2: Grignard reagent adds to the ketone → R-C(OH)-CH2-R' where R' is cyclohexyl.

Wait, but how do we get the cyclohexyl group to be attached via a hydroxymethyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard reagent is cyclohexyl magnesium bromide, which would add to the ketone, giving R-C-O-MgBr and then quenching to give R-C-OH plus the cyclohexyl group. But that's not right; Grignard addition to a ketone gives a secondary alcohol.

Wait, let's outline:

Ketone: R-C(=O)-CH3 → Grignard addition → R-C(-OH)-CH2-MgBr → upon workup, R-C(-OH)-CH2-R' (where R' is cyclohexyl). So the product would have a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexyl group.

But the target has a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group directly attached, not a CH2 group. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard is added in a conjugate fashion. But that requires an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which we don't have yet.

Wait, perhaps after forming the ketone, we can perform an elimination to form an alkene, then ozonolysis to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but that would require an alkene. Let me think.

Another approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, then subjected to some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a vinyl group, then undergoes hydroxylation or oxidation to form the diol, then further reactions.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look at the reagents in the options again.

Looking at option C: after alkylation and hydrogenation, the next step is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is an ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. Ozonolysis of an alkene would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

But in option C, after step 2, the compound is ethylcyclohexane (if hydrogenated). Ozonolysis is for alkenes. So that doesn't fit.

Option B's steps include O3 and H2O, which again would require an alkene. So perhaps the earlier steps generate an alkene.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation of the alkyne, giving R-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. Li in NH3 → perhaps deprotonation and elimination to form an alkene? Because Li in NH3 can cause elimination reactions, especially with alkyl halides, but in this case, after alkylation, we have an alkyne. Wait, but I don't see a halide here.

Alternatively, maybe the Li in NH3 is for deprotonating the alkyne, but I'm not sure.

After step 2, perhaps the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 3: O3. Ozonolysis of an alkyne isn't common. Ozonolysis is typically for alkenes. So perhaps after step 2, we have an alkene.

Wait, perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene. How? Maybe via dehydrohalogenation, but we don't have a halide. Alternatively, perhaps via a [2+2] addition or some other process.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a deprotonation and elimination, turning the alkyne into an alkene via an E2 mechanism, but that would require a base. Li in NH3 is a strong base, so maybe it abstracts a proton adjacent to the alkyne, leading to elimination and forming a double bond.

So, if the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH2CH3, and Li in NH3 causes elimination, perhaps removing a proton from the CH2CH3 group and forming a double bond. That would convert the alkyne into an alkene: R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → wait, no, elimination would remove a hydrogen and a leaving group, but we don't have a leaving group here. Hmm. Maybe that's not the right path.

This is getting really complicated. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the target molecule, it has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl substituent on the same carbon. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a hemiacetal or some kind of addition.

Wait, another possible pathway:

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane into a carbonyl group (like a ketone) via hydration.
2. Perform a Grignard addition to introduce a cyclohexyl group, forming a secondary alcohol.
3. Oxidize the secondary alcohol to a ketone, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard is added to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, the secondary alcohol is oxidized to a ketone again, but that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the Grignard is added to a different position. Maybe after forming the ketone, the Grignard adds to the carbonyl, giving an alcohol, which upon further oxidation forms the aldehyde.

Wait, let's outline:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → (HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O) → cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH. Oxymercuration would add Hg(OH)2 to form a mercuric acetate intermediate, then breaking off to form a carbonyl. So, R-C≡CH + H2O → R-C(OH)-CH3. So the product is R-C(O)-CH3, which is a ketone.

Step 2: Grignard reagent (cyclohexyl MgBr) adds to the ketone → R-C(-O-MgBr)-CH3 → upon hydrolysis, R-C(-OH)-CH3 + cyclohexyl group? No, I think the Grignard would add to the carbonyl, making R-C(-O-)-CH2-MgBr, which upon hydrolysis gives R-C(-OH)-CH2-MgBr → R-C(-OH)-CH2-R' (where R' is cyclohexyl). But wait, the Grignard would add twice to a ketone, but ketones can only take one equivalent of Grignard. No, wait, ketones only add once because they don't have another carbonyl for another addition. So after adding the Grignard, we'd get R-C(-O-MgBr)-CH2-R'. Upon workup, it becomes R-C(-OH)-CH2-R'.

So the product would be R-CH(OH)-CH2-R', where R is cyclohexyl and R' is cyclohexyl. That's not matching the target because the target has R-CHO and R-CH(OH)-cyclohexyl on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps I need to introduce a carbonyl group on the same carbon as the Grignard addition. But that's not fitting.

Alternatively, perhaps after the Grignard addition, we can oxidize the secondary alcohol to a ketone, but that doesn't give an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe after the Grignard addition, we can perform an oxidation. The secondary alcohol can't be oxidized directly to an aldehyde; it would go to a ketone. So that doesn't help.

Hmm, perhaps the Grignard isn't the right approach here. Maybe another method is needed.

Wait, another approach: the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group on the same carbon. Maybe we can form a carbonyl group, then perform a nucleophilic addition to introduce both substituents.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then subjected to a conjugate addition with a nucleophile that brings both groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, then a cyclohexyl group is added via a nucleophilic attack, but that's not straightforward.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps it's better to look at the options again and see which sequence of reagents could possibly lead to the target.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3, (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

After step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So the acetylide is formed and reacted with methanol. Maybe this forms an ether. If the acetylide is R-C≡C^- and reacts with CH3OH, perhaps it becomes R-C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3. Could this deprotonate the ether, leading to elimination? Maybe forming an alkyne again, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction. But Birch reduces aromatic rings, not aliphatic compounds. So this might not be the case.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is for alkenes. So after step 2, we need an alkene. But I don't see how this happens.

Wait, maybe step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene via a dehydrohalogenation-like process. Wait, but where's the halogen? Unless step 1 introduced one.

Wait, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So NaNH2 is a base, and CH3OH is a methylating agent. But the starting material is R-C≡CH. Deprotonation with NaNH2 gives R-C≡C^- Na^+. Reacting with methanol would give R-C≡C-OCH3. So now we have an alkyne with an ether group.

Then, step 2: Li in NH3. Could this cause elimination, removing the OCH3 group and forming a double bond? For example, R-C≡C-OCH3 → R-C≡C-O^- Li^+ → then eliminate to form R-C=C-OCH3? But I'm not sure about the mechanism here. Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 could cause elimination, forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't help.

Hmm. Maybe another approach is needed. Let's think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group and a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group on the same carbon. So perhaps we can form a geminal diol and then dehydrate one of the hydroxyl groups to form the aldehyde.

But how would we get a geminal diol from the starting material?

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, and then a hydroxyl group is introduced via some addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a gem-diol via some reaction.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds to the ketone, introducing a cyclohexyl group. Then, oxidation of the secondary alcohol would form a ketone again, but that doesn't give an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then a cyclohexyl group is added via a nucleophilic addition, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, oxidation would give a ketone, but again, not an aldehyde.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should think about the reagents in the options and try to see which reagent sequence could form the necessary groups.

Looking at option D again, step 4 is NH4OH, which is ammonium hydroxide. That's often used in hydrolysis reactions, perhaps for epoxides or in the Beckmann rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a Grignard reagent that adds a cyclohexyl group, and then a hydroxyl group is introduced.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. Then, a cyclohexyl group is added as a substituent.

But how would that work with the alkyne? Let me think.

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → reduce the triple bond to a single bond, perhaps using H2/Pd, giving R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't help in forming the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is reduced to a double bond, but I don't see a reagent in the options that would do that without hydrogenation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to a Darzens condensation or some kind of cyclization to form the necessary substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a diethylzinc or another reagent adds a cyclohexyl group.

I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C.

Wait, option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of the alkyne to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but the compound after step 2 is an alkane, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form an alkene.

3. O3 → ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → hydrolysis.

Wait, let's outline:

After step 1: R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → elimination, forming R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, elimination would form an alkene. So maybe R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-C≡C-CH2CH2Li → upon elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the compound is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2: Li in NH3 could cause deprotonation and elimination, converting the alkyne into an alkene. So R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → No, I don't think that's right. Alternatively, maybe the Li abstracts a proton adjacent to the alkyne, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So maybe R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 → upon elimination, R-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? That doesn't seem correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a longer chain, but I'm not certain.

Step 3: O3 followed by (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. So if step 2 produces an alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure how that would form the target molecule.

So, considering all this, perhaps the correct sequence involves converting the alkyne into a ketone, then adding a cyclohexyl group via a Grignard reagent, and finally oxidizing to form the aldehyde.

Looking at the options, which one includes steps that would do that?

Option D has steps that include O3 and NH4OH. Maybe after Grignard addition, ozonolysis isn't needed. Alternatively, perhaps the path is different.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then a cyclohexyl group is added via a Wittig reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an aldehyde. Wait, can an alkyne be directly converted into an aldehyde?

I think under certain conditions, terminal alkynes can be oxidized to aldehydes. For example, using O3 and then Zn in aqueous conditions. Or perhaps using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, KMnO4 under acidic conditions oxidizes alkynes. Let me recall: oxidation of alkynes can lead to different products based on conditions. For example, ozonolysis of an alkyne gives carboxylic acids or ketones, depending on the alkyne structure.

But I'm not sure about the exact reagents for converting an alkyne into an aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: after converting the alkyne into a ketone, maybe a Clemmensen reduction is used to reduce the ketone to a CH2 group, but that doesn't help in forming the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then a hydroxyl group is introduced via a Grignard addition, and then the secondary alcohol is oxidized.

Wait, perhaps the ketone is treated with a Grignard reagent, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, oxidation would give a ketone again, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard adds to the ketone, giving a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But again, not an aldehyde.

Hmm. This is getting really tricky. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, option D's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methanol → forms R-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe elimination to form R-CH2-C≡C-OCH3? I'm not sure.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But after step 2, if we have an alkyne, ozonolysis might not work. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 forms an alkene.

4. NH4OH → hydrolysis.

I'm not seeing a clear path here. Maybe I should give up and make an educated guess.

After thinking through all the possibilities, I think the correct sequence involves converting the alkyne into a carbonyl group, then adding a cyclohexyl group via a Grignard reagent, and then perhaps some oxidation or hydrolysis. Looking at the options, option D includes a step with NH4OH, which could be a hydrolysis step. Alternatively, option C includes Ba(OH)2, which might be for elimination or forming epoxides.

But I'm not entirely certain. Based on the steps, I think option D might be the correct one, but I'm not 100% confident.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethylcyclohexyl group on the same carbon. The analysis of the options involves evaluating the sequence of reagents for their ability to achieve the desired transformations:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-CH₃.  
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to an alkane (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).  
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is unclear in this context, as it typically facilitates elimination or saponification, which does not align with the target structure.  
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O (oxymercuration) would act on a triple bond, but the alkyne has already been hydrogenated.  
   This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.  
   - Step 2: Li in liquid NH₃ could deprotonate or eliminate, potentially forming an alkene, but the mechanism is unclear.  
   - Step 3: O₃ (ozone) is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes to form carbonyl groups. However, the compound after Step 2 is not an alkene.  
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a hydrolysis agent, but its role here is ambiguous.  
   This sequence does not clearly form the target structure.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-CH₃.  
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to an alkane (R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).  
   - Step 3: O₃ and (CH₃)₂S (ozone and reductive workup) act on alkenes, but the compound after Step 2 is an alkane.  
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is unclear in this context.  
   This sequence does not align with the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol likely form an ether (R-C≡C-OCH₃).  
   - Step 2: Li in liquid NH₃ could cause elimination or deprotonation, potentially forming an alkene or alkyne.  
   - Step 3: O₃ and (CH₃)₂S (ozone and reductive workup) act on alkenes, but the compound after Step 2 is not explicitly an alkene.  
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a hydrolysis agent, which could play a role in forming the hydroxymethyl group.  
   While unclear, this sequence has the potential to introduce the necessary functional groups.

After analyzing all options, **Option D** appears to have the most plausible sequence for introducing the formyl and hydroxymethylcyclohexyl groups, despite some ambiguities in the exact transformations.
