Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading through the question carefully and breaking it down.

The problem talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is pretty close to normal room temperature, so maybe B is a solid at room temperature.

Another clue is that the product of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Oh, wait, that makes me think of something like NaOH or KOH because those are common reagents. But wait, the problem mentions it's a heavier isotope, so maybe it's something with a higher atomic number.

Let me list the clues:

1. X reacts with Y (liquid) violently, releasing gas W. The gas has same number of neutrons and protons. So W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. Hmmm. Maybe something like H2O? No, H2O has H and O. Wait, no, W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, each molecule? Or each atom? Hmm, the question says each molecule. So in each molecule, the number of neutrons is equal to the number of protons. Wait, but protons are in the nucleus, same as neutrons. So for each molecule, the total neutrons equal the total protons.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like NH3? Wait, NH3 has 1 N and 3 H. Nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (since N is usually 14, but wait, the isotope might vary). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: if each molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons, then the sum of the protons in the molecule equals the sum of the neutrons. Let's think about common gases. Let's see: hydrogen gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (since hydrogen is usually H-1). So H2 would have 2 protons, 0 neutrons. That's not equal. So that's not W.

What about O2? Each O has 8 protons. O is usually O-16, which has 8 neutrons. So each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That works. So W could be O2. Alternatively, maybe another gas.

Wait, what about CO2? No, because CO2 has 1 C and 2 O. Wait, but the sum would be 6 protons in C and 16 each in O, so 6 + 32 = 38 protons; for neutrons, C-12 has 6 neutrons, O-16 has 8 each, so 6 + 16 =22. So 38 vs 22, not equal. So that's not it.

Another possibility: H2O. Let's see. Each H has 1p, 0n; O has 8p and 8n. So H2O has (2*1) +8 =10 p's, and 0 +8 =8 n's. 10 vs 8, not equal.

Wait, maybe methane, CH4? But that's not a gas released in a violent reaction, perhaps. Or maybe something like NO? Let's see. NO has one N and one O. N has 7p, 7n (if N-14). O has 8p, 8n. So total p:7+8=15, total n:7+8=15. So 15 each. That fits. So W could be NO. But NO is a gas, but I'm not sure if that's the common one released in such reactions.

Wait but another thought: maybe the gas is something like CH4? Let's see. Each C has 6p and 6n (if it's C-12). Each H has 1p and 0n. So CH4 has 6 +4=10 p, and 6 n's. 10 vs 6, not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the gas is NH3. Let's see. N is 7p, 7n (assuming N-14). Each H is 1p, 0n. So NH3 has 7 + 3*1 =10 p's, and 7 n's. 10 vs 7: nope.

Hmm, tricky. Maybe another approach. Let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y (liquid) violently. What are some violent reactions? For example, metals reacting with acids, or maybe something like a carbonate reacting with an acid, releasing CO2.

Wait, but the gas W is released. If Y is an acid, then X might be a carbonate. Wait, but carbonate and acid reaction produces CO2 gas. So W would be CO2. But earlier, I thought CO2's p and n counts don't match. Let me recheck.

CO2 has one C and two O's. Each O is 8p and 8n. C is 6p and 6n (if C-12). So total p: 6 + 2*8 =22. Total n:6 + 2*8=22. Oh! Wait, 22 each. So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in the molecule. Oh! So W is CO2. That fits the criteria.

So, the reaction could be between X and Y (acid) producing CO2 gas. So Y would be an acid, perhaps HCl or H2SO4.

But earlier, when I thought about X being a carbonate, but then X is a substance that includes a heavier isotope. Oh, wait, but X is a carbonate, so maybe it's NaHCO3 or something. Alternatively, if Y is an acid, perhaps X is a carbonate, but that's just a thought.

But wait, let's think about the precipitate G. Then, when heated, G releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, that's a bit above zero, so maybe B is a solid that's just slightly above freezing? Or perhaps it's something that's a liquid at 277 K, but that's still pretty close to room temperature.

Wait, another clue: the product of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when keto acid (like a ketone, which is a type of carbonyl compound) reacts with X, the product has 2 O atoms. Hmm, what kind of reaction could that be? Maybe a condensation reaction, like a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, if X is a strong base, such as NaOH or KOH, reacting with a keto acid. Let's think: a keto acid is a molecule with both a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. For example, something like acetone with a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, when X reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it's a base-catalyzed reaction. Maybe the keto acid is something like a β-keto acid, which can undergo decarboxylation in basic conditions.

Wait, but the product has 2 O atoms. Let me think: maybe the product is an ester or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and when it reacts with a keto acid, it displaces something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the fact that X's product with a keto acid has 2 O atoms. Let's think of possible reactions. Maybe X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, but that would just form a salt. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard reagent. No, wait, Grignard reagents are organometallics, but X is incorporating a heavier isotope, so perhaps it's a metal like sodium, potassium, etc.

Wait, but earlier, the reaction with Y is a violent reaction releasing CO2. So if Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate, that makes sense, but then when a carbonate reacts with an acid, you get CO2 gas and a salt. So G could be the salt, like sodium chloride or something else.

Wait, but then what is G? If Y is HCl, and X is Na2CO3, then the reaction would be Na2CO3 + 2HCl → 2NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. So G is NaCl, which is a precipitate? Wait, NaCl is soluble in water, though. So that doesn't make sense. So perhaps Y is a different acid, or X is a different carbonate.

Alternatively, maybe X is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3. Reacting with HCl would produce CO2, H2O, and NaCl. Again, NaCl is soluble. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but perhaps Y is not an acid. Maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal reacting with water (Y is perhaps water?), but that doesn't fit the CO2 part.

Wait, another possible scenario: X could be a metal carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. The reaction produces CO2 and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate as G. For example, CaCO3 reacting with HCl would produce CaCl2, which is soluble, but if X is Ag2CO3, which I think doesn't really exist, or perhaps MgCO3, which is not very soluble. So if Y is HCl, and X is MgCO3, then MgCl2 is soluble. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is not an acid, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a liquid, which could be something like water, but then what reaction would produce CO2? Maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. But the precipitate would then be some other salt, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the precipitate G is some hydroxide. For example, if Y is a solution of a metal cation and X is something that forms an insoluble hydroxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a liquid acid. Wait, but that would release H2 gas more likely than CO2.

Wait, but earlier, I thought W is CO2. So the reaction must produce CO2, which suggests a carbonate reacting with acid.

So, X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, reaction produces CO2 and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, then G is that salt. Then, heating G produces B.

Wait, heating a carbonate... Let's think. If G is
