Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to figure out the chemical formula of the unknown compound from the given options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. The options are labeled A to D.

Starting with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around this region usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak could mean either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak, but sometimes it can also be an alcohol. Another thing, the presence of two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Let me think about what those could be. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which makes me think of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated, like in a ketone or ester? Wait, but wait—if there's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a conjugated ketone. Alternatively, 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a C=C stretch. Hmm, but then again, 1650 could be a carbonyl in an amide or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, like in a ketone with adjacent double bonds—like in a cyclic structure, perhaps cyclohexenone? Or maybe an ester? Or maybe another functional group.

Wait, but wait another thing. FTIR peaks: 1700 is common for esters, ketones, aldehydes, maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 could be something else. Maybe an amide, but I don't see any data that suggests that. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ester or a conjugated ketone. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a C=C stretch, which is around 1600-1680. For example, in an aromatic ring, but that's usually around 1600. Wait, but that could also be for conjugated C=C bonds. So maybe the molecule has both a carbonyl group and a conjugated C=C.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data: several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the Hs attached to a double bond, like in CH₂=CH-. So that suggests the presence of a double bond, maybe an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, perhaps conjugated with a carbonyl group. So maybe something like an enone structure, which is a conjugated dienone or similar.

Now, the Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z 45. I think m/z 45 is a common fragment, perhaps a (CH
