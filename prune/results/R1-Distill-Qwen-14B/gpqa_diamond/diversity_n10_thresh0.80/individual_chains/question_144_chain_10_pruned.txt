Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so that gives me a clue about the expected scale.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Right, the formula is something like L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is v/c, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I get τ? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to make sure about the units here.

So first, let's compute τ. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV. Since ħ in natural units (where ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s), so let me convert Γ into GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056e-24 seconds? Wait, let me calculate that accurately.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 equals... let's see, 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ is about 2.057e-24 s.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since it's produced with energy E_X =8 GeV and mass m_X=1.2 GeV, I can find the Lorentz factor γ and β.

The energy E is related to mass and momentum by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. But since we're working in natural units where c=1, E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2).

So let's compute p. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. E squared is 64, m squared is 1.44. So p squared is 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p is sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Then, γ is E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Hmm, okay. And β is p c / E, but since in natural units, c=1, it's p/E. So β = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. So that's about 0.9888, which is pretty close to the speed of light.

So then, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is τ_lab = γ * τ. So τ_lab = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ let's calculate that. 6.6667 * 2.056875 is approximately 13.7125. So τ_lab is approximately 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Because τ is the proper lifetime, and τ_lab is γ * τ. Oh right, so correct. So that's the time it lives in the lab frame.

Now, the distance it travels is L = β γ c τ. So because β is 0.9888, γ is 6.6667, c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

Let me plug in the numbers. So L = 0.9888 * 6.6667 * 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. τ_lab is gamma tau, so that's correct. So L = β c tau_lab. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau_lab, so the distance is speed (beta c) multiplied by tau_lab.

So L = beta * c * tau_lab.

Wait, but tau_lab is gamma tau, so L = beta * c * gamma tau.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since gamma tau is tau_lab
