Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmmm, let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about the wave function of a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions of the particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So I need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. That means the integral of the probability density over all space should equal 1. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. Oh right, because |ψ(x)|² dx is the probability of finding the particle between x and x+dx.

But wait, the wave function here has a real part and an imaginary part. Let me see: the wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. 

The probability density is |ψ|². To calculate this, I square the magnitude. So, |ψ|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + [(-0.5)]^2. Because when you have a complex number a + ib, the magnitude squared is a² + b². Oh wait, no, that's for a + ib. Here, ψ is (Real part) + i*(Imaginary part), which is (a/sqrt(...)) -0.5i. So in this case, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but ψ(x) is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So ψ(x) can be written as [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + [ (-0.5) i ]. So, for the probability density, |ψ|^2 is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because when you have a complex number A + iB, the magnitude squared is A² + B². So here, A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is -0.5. So |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3. So the integral of |ψ|^2 from 1 to 3 should be 1. So I can set up the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. That's right.

So, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral. Let's split it into two parts:

Integral [ a²/(1+x) dx ] from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² * ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is ln(2), so ln(4)-ln(2) = ln(2). So first integral is a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * ∫dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So adding both parts:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the correct answer is B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + [0.5]^2, which is correct.

Wait, another thing: the wave function must be square-integrable, meaning the integral of |ψ|^2 must converge. In our case, the function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, and when we integrate [a²/(1+x)] from 1 to 3, that's fine because (1+x) is between 2 and 4, so 1/(1+x) is between 0.5 and 0.25. The integral of 1/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is ln(4/2) = ln(2), which is finite. So no problem there.

So the calculation seems correct. So a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \).

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First integral**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \).  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), we get:
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \).  
   This simplifies to \( 0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.5 \).

Adding both parts, the total integral becomes:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
