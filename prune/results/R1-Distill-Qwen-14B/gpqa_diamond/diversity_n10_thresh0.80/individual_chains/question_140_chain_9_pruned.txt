Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully and break it down.

The problem talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it. The question is about finding the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

So, I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let's start with the gas W. The molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That probably means it's a noble gas because noble gases are monoatomic (so one atom per molecule), and their protons and neutrons are often balanced, but wait, actually, the problem says the molecule, so for monoatomic gases, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let me think of which noble gases that might fit.

Let's list the noble gases and their atomic numbers and isotopes:

- Helium (He): Z=2. So if it's a He-3 isotope, it has 2 protons and 1 neutron. But protons (2) don't equal neutrons (1). Hmm, not matching.
- Neon (Ne): Z=10. Isotopes like Ne-20 have 10 protons and 10 neutrons. So protons and neutrons are equal. That fits.
- Argon (Ar): Z=18. Ar-36 has 18 protons and 18 neutrons. So that would also fit. But wait, the melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let me see what B is.

When the precipitate G is heated, it releases B. So B is a product from heating G. If B has a melting point near 277 K, which is about 4°C. Wait, what's the melting point of water? It's 273 K (0°C), so 277 is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps B is something that's a solid around that temperature. Alternatively, maybe it's a substance that's solid at that temperature but just barely.

Wait, also, the product of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the reaction between X and the keto acid, like maybe X is something that adds to the acid. Let me think about common reagents. One possibility is that X is an alkali metal, like sodium or potassium. Those are often used as reagents. Wait, but the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So the elements in X include at least one element with a heavier isotope.

Let me get back to the gas W. If W is Ne (neon), but wait, wait, another scenario: maybe W is something else. For example, CO2 is a molecule where the total protons and neutrons are equal? No, CO2 has 22 protons (C:6, O:8 each, so 6+
