Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains, and each branch produces neutrinos of different energies. 

Wait, the pp-III branch is one of the branches in the proton-proton cycle, right? So, the main pp-I chain is the dominant one, producing a lot of neutrinos, especially around 250-300 keV. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches which are less significant but still contribute. 

The question is asking about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, if the pp-III branch stops, how does that affect the fluxes in these bands?

I think the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in higher energy ranges. Because the main pp-I produces lower energy neutrinos. The pp-III branch's neutrinos are higher energy, perhaps around 700-800 keV or higher. Wait, if pp-III is stopped, then the neutrinos from that process would no longer be produced.

So, band 1 is 700-800 keV. If the pp-III was contributing neutrinos to this band, stopping it would reduce the flux in band 1. What about band 2, 800-900 keV? I'm not sure if pp-III contributes there. Maybe the pp-III neutrinos have a certain peak energy.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the energy ranges. Let me think. The main neutrino production in the Sun comes from the pp chain, which has two main branches: pp-I and pp-II, and then pp-III, which is a minor contributor. The main neutrinos are from the beta decay in the pp-I chain, around 250 keV. The other branches have higher neutrino energies.

Oh right! The pp-II branch produces neutrinos around 800-900 keV? No, wait, maybe the pp-III produces higher energy neutrinos. Or wait, I think the pp-III neutrinos are around 1-2 MeV. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again. I remember that the 8B neutrinos, which are a type produced in the Sun, have an energy around 15-16 MeV, but that's a different process. 

Wait, no. The pp chain neutrinos have lower energies. The dominant pp-I produces around 0.25 MeV (250 keV). The other branches, like pp-II and pp-III, produce higher energy neutrinos than that. So, the pp-III neutrinos would have energies higher than the main pp-I, so perhaps in the 400 keV to maybe 1 MeV range.

Wait, but the bands given are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So if the pp-III neutr
