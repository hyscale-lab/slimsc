Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the problem is about.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem states that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The equilibrium constant, K_{Ca-EDTA}, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ forming a complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²−, where Y is EDTA.

The problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. I think I should set up an equilibrium expression for this complex dissociating. Since CaY²− dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4− (Y), the reaction would be:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−

The equilibrium constant K for this reaction is given as 5e10. So K = [Ca²+][Y^4−] / [CaY²−]

Wait, but wait. The K given is K_{Ca-EDTA}, which is the formation constant. Oh wait, no, wait. Formation constant is Kf, which is the equilibrium for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4− ⇌ CaY²−, and Kf is the formation constant. So the problem gives K_{Ca-EDTA} as 5e10, which is Kf.

But in our problem, we're dealing with the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and Y^4−. So the dissociation constant would be the inverse of Kf. So K_dissociation = 1/Kf.

So K_dissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of CaY²− as [CaY] = 0.02 M initially. But when it dissociates, it will produce some Ca²+ and some Y^4−.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So at equilibrium:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 M (since x is probably very small compared to 0.02, because Kf is large, meaning the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much).

[Ca²+] = x
[Y^4−] = x

So plug these into the dissociation constant equation:

K_dissociation = [Ca²+][Y^4−] / [CaY²−] = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02

We know K_dissociation is 2e-11, so:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11
x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5?

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5... Wait, 1e-13 to the 1/2 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(4e-13) correctly. 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)*10^(-13/2) = 2 * 10^-6.5. 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7 M.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. That's the concentration of Ca²+.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait a minute, but let me double-check my approach. Did I get K right? Because sometimes when dealing with formation and dissociation, it's easy to mix them up.

Formation constant Kf is for the reaction: Ca²+ + Y^4− ⇌ CaY²−. So Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]).

In our problem, the solution is of CaY²−. So when it dissociates, the reverse of the formation reaction occurs. Therefore, the dissociation's K is 1/Kf = 2e-11.

So yes, the setup was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the formation constant. Let's see. The concentration of Ca²+ in solution would be when the complex dissociates. So using Kf, [CaY²−] = Kf * [Ca²+][Y^4−].

But since [Ca²+] = [Y^4−] at equilibrium (because each complex releases one Ca²+ and one Y^4−), let's let [Ca²+] = x, then [Y^4−] = x. So,

0.02 = Kf * x^2

Wait, no. Wait, the formation reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4− ⇌ CaY²−.

At equilibrium, the concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. And the concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4− are x each.

So the formation constant is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−}) ) = 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10.

So solving for x:

x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-12 / 1e1 (since 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = 2e-12 /5e10? Wait, no. Let me compute 0.02 divided by 5e10.

0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 => x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7 M.

Same result as before. So [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7 M. So option C is correct.

I think that's solid. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_{\text{dissociation}} \) is the inverse of the formation constant \( K_f \), which is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). Thus:

\[
K_{\text{dissociation}} = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) are equal, denoted as \( x \). The concentration of the complex \(\text{CaY}^{2-}\) is approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) because the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \). Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{dissociation}} = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_{\text{dissociation}} = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \):

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).**
