Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. The question gives me a few stars with various properties, and I need to figure out which can be seen by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck.

Let me start by understanding the question. Both spectrographs have different brightness limits, I think. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, any star that's brighter than 17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO, and any brighter than 16 can be seen by HIRES. Wait, but magnitudes are such that lower numbers are brighter. So, a star that's magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So, for a star to be detectable by both, it must be brighter than the higher of their limits? Wait, no. Wait, if a star's apparent V magnitude is less than (brighter than) 17, ESPRESSO can detect it. And if it's less than 16, HIRES can. So, to be detected by both, the apparent V mag must be less than 16, because that's the higher brightness (lower mag number) limit?

Wait, let me think again. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, meaning apparent V ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V ≤16. So, stars that are brighter than 16 (i.e., V ≤16) can be seen by both. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's clearly brighter than 17 as well. So, any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be detected by both.

Alternatively, wait, no. Because if a star is at 16.5, then HIRES can't see it since it's brighter than 16.5 which is beyond HIRES's limit (brighter than 16). Wait, no, wait: the question says, with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17. So, V mag ≤17 are detectable. HIRES: stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag ≤16 are detectable. So for a star to be detectable by both, its V mag must be ≤16, because if it's ≤16, both can see it. Because ESPRESSO allows up to 17, which includes 16 and below. HIRES only up to 16. So the overlapping condition is V ≤16.

But wait, let me clarify. If a star has an apparent V magnitude of 16, then:

- ESPRESSO can observe it? Because 16 is ≤17. Yes.
- HIRES can observe it? Because 16 is ≤16. Yes.

So stars with V ≤16 can be observed by both.

Alternatively, if a star has V=16.5, then:

- ESPRESSO can see it (16.5 ≤17. So yes).
- HIRES cannot see it (16.5 >16. So no).

So only stars with V ≤16 can
