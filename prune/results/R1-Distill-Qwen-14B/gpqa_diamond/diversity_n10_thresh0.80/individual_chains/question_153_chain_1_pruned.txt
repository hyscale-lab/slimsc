Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. It's a conjugate addition, right? So the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, which is the less substituted one, but wait, no, actually, the alpha-beta is the double bond, so the beta is the one adjacent to the carbonyl.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each being a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each and then match them with the options given.

Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a diester of malonic acid. Its structure is CH2(COOCH3)2. So when it reacts, the enolate would form on the central carbon. The enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl in the other reactant.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituents in the E configuration. Wait, actually, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Hmm, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, but wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 (methyl acrylate). But the 3 position would be on the CH2 part? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the substituent would be on the third carbon, but that's not possible because acrylate is only three carbons. Maybe the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3 as the (E) isomer. Wait, that can't be because acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, so the substituent would be on the middle carbon, making it CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2CH2? No, perhaps I should draw it:

The correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. If it's 3-substituted, the substituent is on the third carbon, which
