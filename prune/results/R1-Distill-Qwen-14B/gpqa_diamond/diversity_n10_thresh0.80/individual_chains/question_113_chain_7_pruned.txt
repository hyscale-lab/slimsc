Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify it. The options for the chemical formula are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O, C) C6H10O2, D) C6H12O.

I need to figure out which one fits the data given. Let's break down each technique's information.

First, the FTIR. It shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like an ester or ketone. But wait, 1700 is typical for a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching in an aromatic ring). So maybe this compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring? Or maybe another type of group.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the structure must have an alkene group. So maybe it's a conjugated system, combining double bonds.

Then the Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? I remember that a common fragment is CH3CO+ (acetyl group), which is 45. So maybe the molecule has a ketone or ester group, as that would lose a fragment like CH3CO.

Now let's look at the options and see which fit.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation? Let me calculate. Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring plus a carbonyl group, etc. But then, the mass spec fragment is 45, which is possible if there's a fragment like (CH3)2CO, but wait, that's 58. Hmm, maybe another way. Wait, maybe the molecule has an ester group, which upon fragmentation could lose an acyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a CH3CO- group, so the fragment would be CH3CO at 45.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl. But let's see. The IR has a broad peak suggesting O-H, so maybe an alcohol. The presence of a carbonyl group (from IR 1700) would require another DoU. So if this is an alcohol with a carbonyl, that's two DoU. So that fits. But wait, the options here: the formula is C6H10O. Wait, the molecular formula for a ketone plus an alcohol? Like maybe a cyclic hemiacetal? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde and an alcohol? Hmm, but in that case, the IR would have strong peaks for both carbonyl and O-H. But the FTIR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Could be a ring and a carbonyl, or two rings, etc. The presence of O-H (from the broad peak) and a carbonyl would account for two DoU. So maybe this is an ester, which has both an O-H (wait, no, esters don't have O-H unless it's a carboxylic acid ester, but that would be O-H in the acid. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have an O-H? Or perhaps it's an acid, but in the FTIR, a broad peak at 3000 suggests O-H, which is typical for carboxy
