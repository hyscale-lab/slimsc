Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think I should write this out in matrix form to visualize it better. Let's see, |0⟩ is [1; 0] and |1⟩ is [0; 1]. So |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the bottom-right. Adding these two matrices would give me a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Wait, I've heard that density matrices for qubits can be represented as points in a 3-dimensional space, right? This is because any 2x2 density matrix can be parameterized by three parameters, which correspond to the Bloch sphere coordinates. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector in 3D space (like (x, y, z)), and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So comparing the given ρ with the general form. Let me expand the general form. The identity matrix I is [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. 

Putting it all together, (I + r·σ)/2 would be [[ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ]]. 

Now, our given ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], which is the same as (I + 0·σ)/2. Because if I set r_x, r_y, and r_z to zero, then the off-diagonal terms become zero and the diagonal terms are 1/2. So that implies that the vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but what's the geometrical position in the qubit space? Oh right, the Bloch sphere representation. The density matrix corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere scaled by the purity of the state. For a pure state, the vector r has length 1, but for a mixed state, it's less than 1. Here, since r is (0,0,0), the state is the completely mixed state, which would be at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,
