Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. Regularization, as I remember, is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations which don't make physical sense. The idea is to introduce a temporary 'cut-off' or some other method to make the calculations finite, and then later remove the regularization, hopefully leaving finite, meaningful results.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory. Strings are tiny, right? And superstring theory is a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. I think string theories usually aim to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories have. Because in string theory, particles are extended objects, so maybe the interactions are different. I've heard that string theories might not require the same level of regularization because they naturally avoid certain divergences. Or wait, maybe they do use some regularization techniques during calculations, but perhaps they don't need it in the same way as others because the theory is supposed to be UV finite? I'm a bit fuzzy here.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I know that in QCD, when you calculate things like loop diagrams, you get divergences. So regularization is definitely used here. For example, methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization are employed to handle these infinities. So QCD does require regularization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a well-understood quantum field theory. I remember that in QED, you get divergent loop integrals, like when calculating the electron self-energy or the photon propagator. These lead to issues like the charge screening problem. So regularization is necessary here too. Techniques like introducing a cut-off or using renormalization group methods are standard. So QED requires regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, this is the classical theory, not the quantum version. Classical theories don't involve the same divergences because they don't have the same loop integrals or renormalization issues. In classical E&M, you might have issues with point charges and their fields (like the infinite self-energy of a point charge), but those aren't handled through regularization. Instead, they might be handled by other methods, like considering distributions or approximations. But the question is about whether regularization is required. Since regularization is a quantum field theory concept, classical theories don't need it. So classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory needing renormalization.

Wait, but the question is about which theory "never" requires regularization. So looking back, Superstring Theory (A) might not require it because it's supposed to be a theory without divergences. Or wait, maybe string theories do require regularization during intermediate steps but don't need it as a fundamental aspect because the theory itself is finite. Or is it that string theories don't have the same kind of divergences because of the way they handle high energies and the nature of strings?

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D) Classical Electrodynamics because it's a classical theory and
