Okay, so I have this physics question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as:
L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y)

Hmm, I think I remember that the Lagrangian terms usually describe the interactions. So this term must be a coupling between the boson X and some fermions. The structure looks a bit like a Yukawa coupling, which usually describes the interaction between fermions and a scalar boson, like in the Higgs mechanism.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about its kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So I need to find which particles X can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

Wait, kinematic decay means the possible decays based on energy and mass. At lowest order, the process would be tree-level, so considering the main possible interactions.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is λf f ψ_f bar ψ_f (ῡ + X). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh wait, perhaps it's written as λ_f f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe the term is something like ψ_f̄ (ῡ + X) ψ_f, multiplied by λ_f. So the interaction is between the fermion ψ_f and the scalar X, mediated by a Yukawa coupling.

Wait, Yukawa interactions are like scalar-fermion-fermion. So the interaction term would be something like λ X ψ ψ, but in this case, maybe it's (ῡ + X), so the Yukawa term is ψ̄ (ῡ + X) ψ, multiplied by a coupling λ_f, perhaps.

Wait, but the exact structure might not matter as much as which fermions X can decay into. Because the decay X → fermion pair depends on whether X can couple to those fermions. So the allowed decay products are the fermions that this term couples to.

But in the given Lagrangian, the interaction is between X and fermions ψ_f, so X can decay into any ψ_f and their antiparticles. So the possible decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion is ψ_f.

Wait, but the question is about the allowed decays of X considering its mass. So the mass of X is 6 GeV, and when X decays, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than 6 GeV?

Let me list the known fermion masses:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
Muon: ~0.105 GeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Up quark: ~0.003 GeV (current algebra, but in reality around 2-5 MeV?)
Down quark: ~0.004-0.008 GeV
Strange quark: ~0
