Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us how strong the complex is. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So, Ca^2+ and EDTA form a complex, right?

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think that means the concentration of the complex [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M, where Y is the EDTA. But wait, in solution, the complex might dissociate a bit. But because K is so large (5e10), the dissociation should be minimal. So the concentration of free calcium ions should be very low.

The formula for the formation constant K is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this case, the initial solution is 0.02 M CaY^2-. So I can model it using the expression.

At equilibrium, [CaY^2-] is approximately 0.02 M, since K is so big. So, let me denote [CaY^2-] as 0.02 M.

Let me think about the dissociation of the complex. The reaction would be CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. The formation constant K is given, so rearranged, the expression would be K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

Wait, but in the problem, do we have excess EDTA? Or is the solution only of the complex? Because if the solution is only the complex, then the total EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. Alternatively, if the solution is made by adding equal amounts of Ca^2+ and EDTA, then the total concentration would be different.

Wait, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M. Assuming that the solution is formed by dissolving this complex, which may dissociate a tiny bit.

But wait, the total concentration of EDTA would be the sum of the free EDTA and the complex. Similarly for calcium. But if K is so large, the degree of dissociation is very small, so [Ca^2+] and [Y^4-] would be very small compared to [CaY^2-].

So, let's model this. Let the change in [CaY^2-] be x. Since the dissociation is small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then, [Ca^2+] = x, [Y^4-] = x.

So substituting into the K expression:

K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.

So, 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10.

I can solve for x^2: x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 5e10? Wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)e-12. Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So x^2 = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2/(5e12)) = 4e-13? Wait, no, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1
