Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question gives me the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, the compound undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to identify the final product from the options given.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea about the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation mean five rings or double bonds. Since N is present, maybe there's an amine or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably a carbonyl proton, like an aldehyde. Wait, but if it's an aldehyde, the shift is around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That's in the aromatic region. Maybe para-substituted aromatic protons.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another aromatic set, perhaps ortho or meta substituted.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Hmm, maybe some vinyl protons or something else. Broad could mean exchange with something, like -OH, but wait, 2H, maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

Wait, no, because if it's broad, maybe it's an aromatic proton with some hydrogen bonding or something. Alternatively, it could be allylic protons, but they don't usually show up that broad. Or perhaps it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl, but that's usually upfield or in a specific region.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That shift suggests maybe some CH2 near an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2. But it's a doublet, so perhaps it's neighboring another CH2 or something.

Wait, putting this together. The aldehyde at 9.72 is a triplet. So the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group? Because a triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. So maybe it's CH2-CHO, but that would be a triplet for the aldehyde proton, but wait, the CH2 would be split into a triplet from the aldehyde. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the integration is 1H for the aldehyde, so the aldehyde H is coupled to something else. The triplet would mean two neighboring H's. So if the aldehyde is at the end, like R-CHO, then the aldehyde H (RCHO) would have neighboring H's from a CH2 group. Or perhaps a CH group with two H's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like:

Ph-CH2-CHO

But then, that would give the aldehyde as a triplet if the CH2 is next to it. Because the aldehyde H would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet. So let me think about that.

But then, looking at the aromatic signals. The 6.98 and 6.51 are each doublets with 2H each. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, each being a doublet. So maybe two para-substituted aromatic rings. For example, each with two protons in a para position, so each being a doublet.

Wait, but the 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two different aromatic rings. For example, each ring is para substituted, so each pair of protons is a doublet.

Wait, but the 6.27 is a broad singlet, 2H. That's confusing. Maybe it's a vinyl group? Like CH2=CH– something. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with substituents that make the protons broad.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6.27 is a di-substituted aromatic ring, but they're split into a singlet because of symmetry. Or maybe it's an aliphatic proton near an oxygen.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. So maybe it's something like OCH2CH2... but that doesn't fit with the aldehyde.

Alternatively, the 3.66 could be a CH2 next to oxygen, like in an ether or ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a benzaldehyde group and some other substituents. Let's think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO.

Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. So if the compound is benzaldehyde plus something else, like a CH2NO group? Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO, so benzaldehyde (C7H6O) plus, say, a CH2NH2 group would give C8H8N O2, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted benzaldehyde with some other groups.

Wait, let me calculate the molecular formula again. C8H9NO has a molecular weight of (12*8)+(1*9)+(14)+(16) = 96+9+14+16=135 g/mol.

Hmm. Another thought: maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with some substituents that include an oxygen elsewhere. Let's see.

The NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H), which is likely an aldehyde. So perhaps the structure is a substituted benzaldehyde with a substituent that has a CH2 group next to the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the presence of N in the formula suggests perhaps an amine group or an amide. But looking at the NMR, I don't see any signals that would correspond to an amine. So maybe it's an aldehyde and an amine somewhere else.

But wait, the NMR doesn't show any peaks around 1-5 ppm typically for amines. Unless it's an aromatic amine, which would be more upfield. Alternatively, perhaps the N is in a nitro group, but that would be more downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrile, but that's not showing any signals in the NMR.

Hmm, maybe the N is part of an amide. But I don't see any amide signals either.

Wait, perhaps the N is in a pyrrolidone ring or something else, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a nitro group. But nitro groups typically have certain shifts. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a side chain with an amine, but not free NH protons, maybe as part of an aromatic substitution. Alternatively, maybe the N is in a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a phenylpropanal with some substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction steps given. The reactions are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl – this is usually used for diazotization, which is typical for aromatic amines to form diazonium salts, especially under cold conditions (like 0-5°C). But then, if the compound doesn't have a benzene ring with a substituent that can be diazotized, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, but step 1 is NaNO2 and HCl, which suggests a diazotization reaction, which requires an aromatic amine. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group (-NH2 attached to a benzene ring). Then, step 2 is H2O, which would hydrolyze the diazonium salt. Usually, diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis under certain conditions. For example, if the amine is para to another substituent, hydrolysis can form a phenol.

So putting it together: the initial compound has a benzene ring with an amino group. Then, after diazotization, hydrolysis would replace the amino group with a hydroxyl group. Then, step 3 is aqueous KOH with heat, which could be a de
