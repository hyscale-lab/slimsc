Okay, so I have this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets, and I'm trying to figure out which one the researchers should observe. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

So, the setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers can choose the one with higher probability to maximize their chances of detection.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orbital distance. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (something else? Or maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to some other factor... Wait, I think it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, the transit probability P is approximately (R_star / a)², where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think. Oh wait, no, the formula is actually P = (R_star / a) * something else. Oh wait, right, the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a)² multiplied by (something else?). No, wait, I'm confusing it with other factors. Let me think again.

The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view) depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. The formula I recall is P = (R_*/ a)^2 * ( (1 + R_p / R_*) )^2, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, this is approximately (R_*/a)^2.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting that wrong. Another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbit. So, probability is (pi R_star^2) / (pi a^2
