Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas. Let me break down the given data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. A very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups because they're typically from strong hydrogen bonds, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, wait. The peak here is very broad, which makes me think it's an -OH stretch. So the compound likely has an alcohol group or maybe a carboxylic acid. Also, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1.

Hmm, those peaks. The 1700 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to carbonyl groups. Like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm-1 is another peak; that's a bit lower. Wait, but 1650 is in the range for conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe an ester or something with conjugation. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with some substitution. Alternatively, if there's an amide, but I don't think so because the options don't have N. Let's think about the possibilities.

So, the presence of an O-H (from the broad peak) and a carbonyl group (1700). So maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the carbonyl would be around 1700. If it were a ketone, the O-H wouldn't be present. So another thought: perhaps an ester. Esters have a carbonyl group, and if there's an -OH somewhere else, maybe from an alcohol group or another ester? Wait, but esters don't have O-H unless they're something like diesters or if there's another functional group.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the carbonyl is from an ester, and the O-H is from an alcohol. So the compound could be an ester with an alcohol group. Or perhaps a ketone and an alcohol, but that's less common. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, the possible
