Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature of the star. Oh right, it's something to do with the Boltzmann distribution. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, that's the same as k (Boltzmann constant) because k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Interesting.

Since the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can use the Boltzmann equation here. The equation is for the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of atoms in different energy states depends on temperature.

The formula I remember is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Since the higher energy level is E2 and lower is E1, E2-E1 is positive. Wait, in this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So E2 - E1 = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

In star_1, the population is twice that of star_2. So for each star, I can write the ratio of excited atoms to ground state atoms.

Let me think: for star 1, the ratio would be n1_excited/n1_lower = 2. Similarly, for star 2, n2_excited/n2_lower = 1 (since star_1 is twice as excited, so star_2 is 1 times, I think. Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So maybe it's n1/n2 = 2, where n is the population in the excited state.

So the Boltzmann factor for star_1 is (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly, for star_2, it's (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But wait, the problem says that the
