Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, proportional, so I'll need to normalize it. Then, we have an operator whose matrix elements Aij are such that if i is not equal to j, Aij is hbar/2, else zero. So the matrix is like a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

The questions are: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator, and find the average value of that operator.

Wait, no, the operator's matrix is given by Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else zero. So for a 2x2 system, the matrix would be:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Hmm, that's an interesting operator. It looks like it's a spin operator but not in the z-basis. Wait, the standard Pauli matrices—like X, Y, Z—have different structures. Oh, wait, actually, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply that by hbar/2, we get the same structure. So maybe this operator is (hbar/2) times sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of sigma_x. Because if A = (hbar/2) sigma_x, then the eigenstates of A are same as those of sigma_x.

But wait, the question says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, but we need to find its components in the eigenbasis of A, which is the sigma_x basis.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the operator A is diagonalized by the eigenstates of sigma_x, so to find the probabilities, I can expand |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value using the given state and the operator, but the question specifically asks for the probabilities of each eigenstate and the average value.

So, first, I'll need to normalize |alpha>. Let's compute its norm.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The norm squared is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

Coefficient for |up> is (1+i). Its magnitude squared is |1+i|² = 1² +1² = 2.

Coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). Magnitude squared is 2² + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator A has matrix [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues hbar/2 * 1 and -hbar/2 * 1, respectively.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The Pauli X matrix sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So the operator A being (hbar/2) sigma_x would have eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenstates are as I said: |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate when we measure the operator A, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>. The coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

So let's compute the expansion of |alpha> in the x-basis.

Express |alpha> as a combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Wait, let me write |alpha> as (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

We can write this in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

We can compute a and b by taking inner products with |+x> and |−x>.

So,

a = < +x | alpha >

Similarly,

b = < −x | alpha >

Compute a:

< +x | = [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] in the z-basis.

So,

a = [1/sqrt(2)]*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + [1/sqrt(2)]*(2 - i)/sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Simplify numerator:

(1+2) + (i -i) ) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So, a = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute b:

b = < −x | alpha >

< -x | is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

So,

b = [1/sqrt(2)]*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + [ (-1)/sqrt(2) ]*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Simplify numerator:

(1 -2) + (i +i) ) = (-1) + 2i.

So, numerator is (-1 + 2i).

So,

b = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Now, the probability of measuring +x is |a|², and similarly for -x with |b|².

Compute |a|²: (3)^2 / (sqrt(14))² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Compute |b|²: |(-1 + 2i)|² /14.

The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429,
