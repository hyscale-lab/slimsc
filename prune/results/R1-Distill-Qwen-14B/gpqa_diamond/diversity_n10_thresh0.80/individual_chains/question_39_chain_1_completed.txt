Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So, we're dealing with identical systems, each having a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measure the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3, so x can't be less than 1 or greater than 3.

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A to D. I remember that wave functions need to be normalized. Normalization means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because probabilities must sum to one.

Wait, but in this case, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function, but the modulus squared is what gives the probability. Oh wait, but wait, wait. The given wave function seems to have a real part and an imaginary part. Let me think. Oh, no, the expression is (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but wait. How does that make sense? Because if the wave function is ψ(x) = real part + imaginary part, then the modulus squared is [real part]^2 + [imaginary part]^2. But in this case, the imaginary part is a constant. Oh, but wait, that might complicate things. Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i.

Wait, but if the wave function is ψ(x) = R(x) + iI(x), then |ψ|^2 = R² + I². So in this case, R(x) is a/(sqrt(1 + x)) and I(x) is -0.5.

So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. But wait, the wave function must be normalized, so the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

But wait, hold on. If the wave function is given as ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i, then when you square the modulus, you get (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. But wait, that's a problem because the integral of (a²/(1+x)) from 1 to 3, plus the integral of (0.5)^2 over the same interval, must equal 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the second term would be a constant (0.25) multiplied by the interval length (2, from x=1 to x=3). So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5. Then the integral of the first term would need to be 0.5 as well, because 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.

So let's calculate the integral of a²/(1+x) from x=1 to x=3.

Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So the integral becomes a² * ln(2). This must equal 0.5, because the other term gives 0.5.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5. Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Let's compute that.

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 is about 0.7208. So a² = 0.7208, which means a is the square root of that. Let me compute sqrt(0.7208). Hmm, sqrt(0.72) is around 0.8485. So a is approximately 0.8485.

Looking at the options: option B is 0.85, so that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I do that correctly? Let me double-check.

The modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. Integrating that from 1 to 3: ∫1^3 [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = [a² ln(1+x)] from 1 to3 + 0.25*(3-1).

Which is a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln2, and 0.25 * 2 = 0.5. So total is a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1. So a² ln2 = 0.5. So a² = 0.5 / ln2 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7208. So a ≈ sqrt(0.7208) ≈ 0.8485. So option B is 0.85, which is the closest.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the normalization condition requires that:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

The second integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

The first integral is:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1 + x} dx.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + x} \) is \( \ln(1 + x) \), so:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1 + x} dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2).
\]

Combining the two terms, the normalization condition is:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7208 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7208} \approx 0.8485.
\]

The closest option to \( 0.8485 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
