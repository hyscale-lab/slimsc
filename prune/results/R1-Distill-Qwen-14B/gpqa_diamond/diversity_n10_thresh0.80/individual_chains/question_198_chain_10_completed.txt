Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about calculating the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]²− or something like that. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions, so probably the β2 or β3? Hmm, wait, the stability constants are given in order, so β1 is for the first complex, β2 the second, etc.

Stability constants (formation constants) are given, so each βn corresponds to the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n?), maybe. For example, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, because Co^2+ plus SCN^- gives [CoSCN]^+, which has a charge of +1. Or wait, wait. Let me think: For each n, the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} ? Because Co²+ has two positive charges, each SCN- is -1. So if n=1, the complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, because 2 - 1 = +1. For n=2, it's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, neutral? Or wait, 2 + (−2) = 0. Hmm, but maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the complexes have higher charges.

Wait, perhaps the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} because each SCN- is -1. So:

n=1: [CoSCN]^+ → 2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ → charge is 2+ -1 = +1.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) → 2+ - 2*(-1) ? Wait, no. Each SCN- is -1, so n=1: charge is 2+ - (1)(-1) → 2+ +1- → 3+? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Hmm, perhaps the charge is 2+ minus n*(-1), which is equal to 2 + n. So for n=1, the charge would be 3+; n=2 → 4+? But that doesn't make sense because the complexes would have higher charges. Alternatively, maybe the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^{(2−n)+} ? Because Co^2+ has a +2 charge, and each SCN- is -1. So n SCN- would contribute -n. So the total charge is 2+ - n*1 → [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n+}.

Wait, that seems more right. So for n=1: 2-1=+1; n=2: 0 charge? Hmm. Wait, that can't be because neutral complexes are less common, but perhaps possible.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that each βn is the stability constant for the nth complex. So the problem is to calculate the fraction of the Co species that are in the form where they have two SCN- attached, i.e., the dithiocyanato complex, which is probably the β2 complex, because that's the second complex formed.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The stability constants are given in order β1, β2, β3, β4. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+; β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0; β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-; β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But the problem is asking about the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which would correspond to β2=40.

Wait, but the question says 'the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes.' So blue is the color of the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex? Or maybe it's a different complex, but in any case, perhaps the correct β is β2.

But wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible species present and how to compute their concentrations.

The total concentration of cobalt is 0.01 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The species present are:

Co²+,
[Co(SCN)]^+,
[Co(SCN)_2]^0,
[Co(SCN)_3]^-,
[Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Each of these has a certain concentration, and their sum should add up to the total Co concentration, which is 0.01 M.

The problem is to find the fraction of the Co that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex. So I need to calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 divided by the total concentration of Co species, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

But how do I find the concentration of each species?

I remember that the distribution of metal complexes can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal. The general approach is to assume that the metal can form complexes up to the 4th order (since β4 is given), and each complex forms stepwise.

The formation of each complex is a stepwise process. So, for example, the formation of [Co(SCN)]^+ from Co²+ and SCN- is:

Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+ ; K = β1 =9.

Then, [CoSCN]^+ can react with another SCN^- to form [Co(SCN)_2]^0: 

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^0; K = β2 =40.

Similarly for higher complexes.

The formation constants (βn) are given for each step. So the overall stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the individual β's up to n.

Wait, no. Wait, the βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So, for example, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+ from Co²+ and SCN^-.

β2 is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)₂]^{0}, which would be β1 multiplied by the second step's β (which I'll call β2'), but the given β2 is 40. So perhaps the given βn are the overall stability constants for each complex, not stepwise.

Wait, that's a crucial point. If the given βn are the overall stability constants, then the formation of each complex is considered as a single step. For example, β1 = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-] )

Similarly, β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 )

And so on.

But wait, that can't be right because the overall β for the second complex can't be higher than the first, unless each step is increasing. But in any case, the given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β increases up to n=3 and then drops for n=4.

But wait, the problem gives β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. Hmm, that seems odd because you'd expect the stability to increase with the number of ligands, but perhaps not always.

So, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex. The idea is to find the distribution of Co species across all possible complexes given the ligand concentration and stability constants.

But how?

I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the formula that considers the overall stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex as a function of βn and the ligand concentration.

Another approach is to use the formula for the fraction of each species. For each complex, the fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n ) / ( 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... + β1β2...βn [SCN^-]^n )

Wait, no. Wait, the fraction for each species is the product of the previous β and [SCN^-] divided by the sum of all terms. But perhaps I should think in terms of the cumulative product of β's.

Alternatively, the fraction of Co in the nth complex is f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum from k=0 to 4 of β_k [SCN^-]^k ), where β_0 is 1 (since [Co²+] is the species when n=0).

Wait, let me think. The general formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN^-]^k )

Because for each n, the term is βn multiplied by [SCN^-]^n. And the denominator is the sum over all possible n (from 0 to 4) of βn [SCN^-]^n.

So in this case, β0 is 1, and the terms are:

n=0: β0 [SCN^-]^0 = 1 *1 =1

n=1: β1 [SCN^-]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9

n=2: β2 [SCN^-]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

n=3: β3 [SCN^-]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

n=4: β4 [SCN^-]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Now, sum all these terms in the denominator:

sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016

Let me calculate that:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for each n is [βn*(0.1)^n ] / 2.3646.

We're interested in the fraction where n=2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So f_2 = (40*(0.1)^2) / 2.3646 = (40*0.01)/2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but wait. The options include D) 16.9%. So that's the percentage. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait a second. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. But in my calculation, I assumed that n=2 corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex, which it does (two SCN- ions). So the fraction is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the denominator is sum from n=0 to 4 of βn [SCN^-]^n.

I've calculated each term correctly:

n=0 →1

n=1→9*0.1=0.9

n=2→40*0.01=0.4

n=3→63*0.001=0.063

n=4→16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum: 1 + 0.9 =1.9 → +0.4 is 2.3 → +0.063 → 2.363 → +0.0016 → 2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, so 16.9%.

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem states that the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. How does that come into play? Oh, because each [Co-species] is based on that. But in the fraction calculation, the [Co] cancels out because each species' concentration is proportional to βn [SCN^-]^n. So the fraction is independent of the total concentration because it's a ratio.

So yes, the calculation seems correct, and option D is the answer.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the given concentrations: total cobalt concentration \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

The fraction of cobalt in the \( n \)-th complex is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

Here, \( \beta_0 = 1 \) (representing the free \( \text{Co}^{2+} \) ion), and the denominator is the sum of all terms \( \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k \) for \( k = 0 \) to \( 4 \). The numerator for \( n = 2 \) corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex, \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2]^0 \), and is calculated as \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 \).

### Step 1: Calculate each term in the denominator
- \( n = 0 \): \( \beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

### Step 2: Sum the terms in the denominator
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\( n = 2 \))
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 4: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
