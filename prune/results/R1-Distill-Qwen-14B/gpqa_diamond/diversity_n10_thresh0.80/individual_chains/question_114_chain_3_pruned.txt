Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about reagents for certain reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's that product look like? Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with HCN (from NaCN), I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, but wait, I remember that when you have a ketone and you add HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. Right, a cyanohydrin is when the H from HCN adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the CN- adds to the oxygen, making an alcohol and nitrile group on adjacent carbons.

So the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, no, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product's formula is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that out as CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but butanenitrile would be four carbons. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but wait that's only three carbons. Oh wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Or perhaps wait, perhaps the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH2CH2) or something else? Hmm, perhaps I should focus more on the reagents.

So the first
