Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes—no spots vs. has spots.

Wait, let me think about what affects the ratio of atoms in different energy levels. Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight and E is energy. If the ratio decreases when there are spots, that means that the number of atoms in level 2 is increasing relative to level 1 when spots are present. 

But wait, what's the transition wavelength given here? 1448 Å. That's in the near UV or perhaps visible spectrum. I think 1448 Å is about 144.8 nm, which is in the far UV? Wait, actually, 1000 Å is 100 nm, so 1448 is 144.8 nm, which is UV. Hmm, but for stars, the photospheric temperature affects which lines are formed. 

When the star has spots, its overall effective temperature is lower. The spots are cooler, but how does that affect the photosphere's temperature structure? Wait, the question says the overall Teff decreases. So the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. 

Wait, but when calculating the Boltzmann factor, does it matter what part of the surface we're considering? Or is the effective temperature what matters for the overall photosphere? Because the photosphere itself might have varying temperatures, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can assume the effective temperature is the relevant temperature for the average photospheric conditions.

So the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The ratio n1/n2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So the ratio depends on the temperature T.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). So T decreases. Let me see how this affects the exponent.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. Let's compute the ratio before and after. Let's say R = n1/n2. So R_initial corresponds to Teff_initial =6000 K. R_spot corresponds to Teff_spot=5500 K. 

So R_initial / R_spot = [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ) ] 

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so it's exp( [ΔE/(k)] * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) )

Wait, because the exponent is negative, let me make sure. Let me compute the exponents:

At T=6000: exponent is -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) = -ΔE/(k*6000)

At T=5500: exponent is -ΔE/(k*5500)

So the ratio R_initial/R_spot = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, because when you divide the two, the exponentials subtract: exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b). So a is from T=6000 and b from T=5500.

Wait, a is -ΔE/(k*6000), b is -ΔE/(k*5500). So a - b = [ (-ΔE/(k*6000)) ] - [ (-ΔE/(k*5500)) ] 

Which equals ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

Because  -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) = ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

So the exponent becomes ΔE/(k) ( (6000 - 5500) ) / (5500 * 6000) )

Wait, wait, let me compute 1/5500 minus 1/6000. Let me compute that: 

1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818
1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667

So 1/5500 - 1/6000 ≈ 0.0000151

Which is (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500 / (5500*6000) )

Wait, 500/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) )= 1/(66,000) ≈ 1.515e-5.

Wait, but the exact value isn't critical yet. The key point is that the exponent is positive because 1/5500 > 1/6000. So the exponent is positive, so exp(positive) is a number greater than 1.

So R_initial/R_spot = exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (500)/(5500*6000) ) )

Wait, but how do we find ΔE? The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference ΔE is equal to hc/λ.

So ΔE = hc/(lambda) 

H is Planck's constant, c speed of light. Let me compute this.

h=6.626e-34 J s

c=3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8 ) / (1.448e-7 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 /1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So divide by 1.602e-19:

1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So ΔE ≈8.57 eV.

But wait, wait. Wait, 1 photon's energy is hc/lambda. So yeah, about 8.57 eV. But wait, that's per photon. And k (Boltzmann constant) is 8.617e-5 eV per K.

So let me compute (ΔE)/(k) in units of K.

So ΔE =8.57 eV.

k=8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE /k = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ approximately 100,000 K. Wait, let's calculate that.

Wait, 8.57 divided by 8.617e-5 is 8.57 / 0.00008617. Let's compute that:

8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.57 * (1 / 0.00008617) ≈ 8.57 * 11600. 

Wait, 0.00008617 is 8.617e-5, so 1/8.617e-5 is approximately 11600 (since 1e5 /8.617 ≈ 11600). So 8.57 * 11600 ≈ let's see: 8 *11600=92800, 0.57*11600≈6612 → total about 99,412 K. Approximately 99,400 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 99,400 K.

Now, let's compute the exponent: (ΔE/k) * (500)/(5500*6000) )

Wait, wait, earlier we had:

Exponent = (ΔE/k) * (1/5500 -1/6000) = (ΔE/k) * ( (6000-5500) ) / (5500*6000) )

Which is (ΔE/k) * (500)/(33,000,000) )

Wait, 5500*6000 = 33,000,000. So 500/33e6 = 500/(3.3e7) ) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So exponent ≈ 99,400 K * 1.515e-5 1/K.

Calculating this: 99,400 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute 99,400 * 1.515e-5.

First, 99,400 = 9.94e4.

Multiply by 1.515e-5: 9.94e4 *1.515e-5 = (9.94 * 1.515) * 1e-1.

9.94 *1.515 ≈ let's compute:

10 *1.515 = 15.15, but subtract 0.06 *1.515≈0.0909 → 15.15 -0.0909≈15.06.

So 15.06 *0.1=1.506.

So exponent ≈1.506.

So the factor R_initial/R_spot = exp(1.506).

Exp(1.506) is approximately e^1.506. Let's compute that.

e^1 is about 2.718. e^0.5 is about 1.648. So e^1.5 is approx 4.481.

Wait, let me get a more precise value. 1.506 is close to 1.504, which is ln(4.5). Let me think: ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504. Oh, wait, that's right. Because 4.5 is e^1.504.

So our exponent is 1.506. So e^1.506 is slightly more than 4.5. Let's compute more accurately.

Since 1.504 → e^1.504 =4.5.

At 1.506, it's 2 *0.002 in the exponent. Each 0.001 increment in x, e^x increases by about e^x *0.001. So at x=1.504, e^x=4.5.

So for 1.504 + 0.002 → e^1.506 = e^(1.504 +0.002) = e^1.504 * e^0.002 ≈4.5 * (1 +0.002 + (0.002)^2/2) ≈4.5*(1.002002) ≈4.509.

So approximately 4.51.

So the factor is about 4.5.

Wait, but the question is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So R_initial / R_spot is about 4.5. So the ratio increases by a factor of ~4.5.

But wait, the question states that the observed ratio decreases when spots are present. That is, R_spot is lower than R_initial. So R_initial is larger, which aligns with our calculation. So the factor is ~4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mess up the ratios. Let's think: when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. Lower T → lower exponent in the Boltzmann factor.

So for R = n1/n2, which is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ).

At lower T (5500 K), the exponent is -ΔE/(k*5500), which is more negative than at 6000 K. So the exponential is smaller, hence R is smaller. So when spots are present, R is lower.

So the initial R (no spots) is higher than R_spot. So R_initial / R_spot is greater than 1. Which is what we found (4.5).

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{initial}}}{R_{\text{spot}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{initial}}}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{spot}}}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spot}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{initial}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Parameters and Energy Difference
- \(T_{\text{initial}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\), \(T_{\text{spot}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
- The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\).
- The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is calculated using \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):
  \[
  \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):
  \[
  \Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Boltzmann Constant and Exponent
The Boltzmann constant is \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). The term \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\) is:
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

The exponent in the factor is:
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spot}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{initial}}}\right).
\]
First, calculate \(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spot}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{initial}}}\):
\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Now, multiply by \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\):
\[
99,400 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.506.
\]

### Step 3: Final Factor
The factor is:
\[
\exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
