Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part step by step.

Alright, the first part is reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something.

Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. The structure is (CH3COO)2CH. So it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. When it acts as a Michael donor, it can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, the other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. But wait, no, wait. The formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So acrylate is CH2CHCOO-. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent at the 3 position. Oh wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-R. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate at the beta position. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or maybe CH2CH(CO OCH3)-p-tolyl? No, wait, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl being CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylateâ€”so the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- attached to the methyl group. The
