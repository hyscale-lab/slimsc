Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem is about a star's properties when it has spots versus when it doesn't. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”when the star is spotless compared to when it's spotted.

Hmm. So, the key here is the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations N2/N1 is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy of the level.

Wait, but in this case, the ratio is N1/N2. Oh wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let me think. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is spotless, the ratio is higher.

Wait, the ratio observed is the number of level 1 divided by level 2. So without spots, N1/N2 is higher than when spots are present. So, the factor we're looking for is (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.

But why does the ratio change when the star has spots? Because the effective temperature changes. So when the spots are present, the overall T_eff is lower. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler regions. So the overall photosphere is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions, but the effective temperature (as measured) is lower when spots are present.

Wait, but in this problem, the overall Teff is given as 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So the star's overall emission is as if it's a blackbody at 5
