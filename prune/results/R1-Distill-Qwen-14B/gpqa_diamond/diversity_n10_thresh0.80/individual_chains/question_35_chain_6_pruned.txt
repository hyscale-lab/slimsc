Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. So the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. 

Wait, first, let me parse the problem. Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix whose first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this: 

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Right, and c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * S.

Wait, but what's S? Oh, probably the spin matrix for the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, Pauli matrices are usually σx, σy, σz. Let me recall: σy is the matrix with [0, -i; i, 0], yes, so S is σy. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So Ay = c * σy. And c is h/(4π). So let me write that out: 

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. 

But wait, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) =0.

So let's compute that. The matrix Ay is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i , (h/(4π))*0 ]

So it's:

[ 0 , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

So the matrix is:

0      (-i h)/(4π)
i h/(4π) 0

The eigenvalues λ satisfy:

|Ay - λ I| = 0

Which becomes:

| -λ      (-i h)/(4π) |
| i h/(4π)  -λ      |  = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

So determinant = λ² - [ (i*(-i) h² ) / (16 π²) ) ]

Wait, i*(-i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So let's compute the second term:

( (i) * (-i) ) = -i² = 1. So the term is (1 * h² )/(16 π² )

So determinant equation: λ² - (h²)/(16 π² ) = 0

So λ² = h²/(16 π² )

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait, because I was solving for Ay. So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π). 

Wait, looking at the options, option B has eigenvalues with real parts ±1 and imaginary parts ±1/2. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are purely real, right? Because the determinant calculation suggests λ is real. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix
