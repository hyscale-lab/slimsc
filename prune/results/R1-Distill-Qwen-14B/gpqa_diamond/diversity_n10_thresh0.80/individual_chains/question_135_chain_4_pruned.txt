Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the decay of a boson X. The question gives me the Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of the boson is 6 GeV. I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson depends on what particles can be produced given the conservation laws and energy constraints. So the first thing I should think about is the possible fermion pairs the boson can decay into.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh, I think it's written as -λ f ψ_f bar (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So this looks like a Yukawa coupling term. The interaction is between the boson X and the fermion ψ_f with coupling λ.

In Yukawa theory, the interaction allows the boson to couple to fermions, so the possible decays would be into a pair of fermions. So X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f bar, right?

Wait, but the problem is asking about the allowed decays, so which fermions can X decay into? Well, the possible fermions depend on their masses because the boson's mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermion to allow decay. Because in decay, energy and momentum must be conserved, so the rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that has a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV is allowed.

But wait, particles like electrons, muons, taus, etc. have their own masses. Let me list the approximate masses of the known fermions (in GeV/c²):

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (but in reality, it's about 2.2 MeV)
- Down quark (d): ~0.0045 GeV (similar to u, but heavier)
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

But wait, when considering fermion pairs, the sum of their masses must be less than the mass of X. So for each fermion f, we need 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So let's calculate 2m_f for each fermion:

- e: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV → much less than 6 GeV. So e+ e- decay is allowed.
- μ: 2 * 0.105 = 0.21 GeV → allowed.
- τ: 2 * 1.777 ≈ 3.554 GeV → allowed (since 3.554 <6).
- u: 2 * 0.003 ≈ 0.006 GeV → allowed.
- d: 2 * 0.0045 ≈ 0.009 GeV → allowed.
- s: 2 * 0.095 ≈ 0.19 GeV → allowed.
- c: 2 * 1.27 ≈ 2.54 GeV → allowed.
- b: 2 *4.1 =8.2 GeV → which is greater than 6 GeV. So b and anti-b cannot be produced because the sum is 8.2>6. So X → b bbar is not allowed kinematically.
- t: 2*173 ≈346 GeV → way larger, so no.

So looking at the options, which decay channels are allowed?

The allowed fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

But wait, the Lagrangian is written as λ f ψ_f bar (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the term. The interaction term would usually be something like λ X ψ_f bar ψ_f, which would correspond to X coupling to fermion-antifermion pairs. So for each fermion that this Lagrangian couples to, the X can decay into that fermion and its antiparticle.

But wait, the Lagrangian is written as -λ f
