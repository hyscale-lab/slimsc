Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of water) to produce a butanoic acid derivative.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. So, ketones have a carbonyl group, and under certain conditions, they can add a nucleophile like CN-.

So for the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So the mechanism probably involves the attack of CN- on the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but adding CN- directly? I'm trying to think. Oh, right, sometimes when you have a ketone and a weak nucleophile like CN-, you might need some acid catalysis. Because the carbonyl is usually attacked by nucleophiles, but in a ketone, the carbonyl is less reactive than in aldehydes. So maybe the reaction is acid-catalyzed.

So, acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen to make it a better leaving group, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then the CN- can attack. So the reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is what sulfuric acid would provide). Or maybe another acid?

So in the first step, butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ would give the product. Let me think: when a ketone adds CN-, it becomes a cyanohydrin. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense because the CN adds to the carbonyl, and the proton adds to the oxygen, which then becomes an -OH group after deprotonation.

Wait, but the product has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So that's a cyanohydrin formation.

So reaction A is H3O+? Or maybe another acid like H2SO4? Because NaCN is a salt, and the acid would be a proton source.

The second reaction is a bit trickier. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a compound with a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon (a cyanohydrin structure). Then, when treated with reagent B (which is in H2O), it forms a butanoic acid derivative.

Hmm, so we have a nitrile and a hydroxyl group on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the molecule is something like:

Ph-CH2-C6H4-CH(OH)-CH2-CN? Wait, maybe I should draw it. Let's see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN,
