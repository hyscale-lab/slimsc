Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, no, the rhombohedral system is actually a type of cubic or trigonal? I think it's part of the cubic system but with all edges equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So the structure is like a cube that's been skewed, maybe?

The problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between neighboring atoms along the lattice, so that's the lattice parameter 'a' in a cubic system. But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, all edges are equal, so a, b, c are all the same. Oh wait, no, I think in a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal. So in this case, alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. So that's a rhombohedral lattice with a=10 Angstrom and angles of 30 degrees each.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the reciprocal of the square root of (h² + k² + l²) times some function involving the lattice parameter and the angles. Wait, I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... something involving the angles. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with a rhombohedral structure is more complicated than the simple cubic case.

Wait, in the cubic case, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But when the angles aren't 90 degrees, you have to account for that. So the general formula must involve the structure factor and the angles. I think the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) )^(-1/2). Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's using the reciprocal lattice approach.

Wait, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )

But since in this case, all the angles are equal (alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees), so cos(alpha)=cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the denominator becomes h² + k² + l² + 2hk*(sqrt(3)/2) + 2hl*(sqrt(3)/2) + 2kl*(sqrt(3)/2)

Simplifying, we can factor out the 2*(sqrt(3)/2) ) which is sqrt(3).

So denominator is h² + k² + l² + sqrt(3)(hk + hl + kl)

In this problem, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging in:

Denominator = 1² +1²+1² + sqrt(3)(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)
= 3 + sqrt(3)(3)
= 3 + 3*sqrt(3)

So d = a / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3))

But a is 10 Angstroms.

So d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Let me compute the denominator numerically.

Compute sqrt(3): approx 1.732.

So 3 + 3*(1
