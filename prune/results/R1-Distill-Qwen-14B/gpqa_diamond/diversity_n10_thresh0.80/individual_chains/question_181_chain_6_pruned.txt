Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Wait, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The proton-proton chain is the main one, and I think it has different branches. Oh right, there's the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. The pp-III branch is one of the less significant ones but still contributes. So, if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, how does that affect the neutrino flux reaching Earth?

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the proton-proton chain. The main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos, right? They come from the decay of boron-8 in the CNO cycle, or wait, no, I think the pp chain produces more of them. Oh, right, the dominant neutrinos are from the pp chain. So, if a branch stops, the number of neutrinos from that part would drop.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the pp-III branch contributes to these energy ranges.

I recall that neutrino production in the Sun has a spectrum. The neutrino energy depends on the process. The higher-energy neutrinos come from different processes than the lower-energy ones. For example, the dominant neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy, but the pp chain produces a broader spectrum, including both lower and higher energies.

Wait, the pp-III branch, what does that produce? The pp-III branch involves the reaction where two protons combine to form a deuterium nucleus, then another proton combines, and eventually a helium-3 nucleus. Oh wait, no, the pp-III branch is the part where two helium-3 nuclei (He-3) combine to form a helium-4 nucleus (He-4) plus two protons. That's the main part of the pp chain, right? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the branches. Let me think again.

Actually, the pp chain has a main branch (pp-I) which produces deuterium, then pp-II and pp-III. Oh, right, the pp-III branch is the part where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form helium-4. That's the main reaction, I think. So that's where a lot of the neutrinos come from.

But wait, neutrinos are produced in a few key steps. One is the decay of boron-8, which emits a neutrino. But that's part of the CNO cycle, I believe. The other is the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction, which releases lower-energy neutrinos. Then, there's the main pp chain, which produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, in the main pp chain, when two He-3 nuclei combine to form He-4, that releases two protons. But where do the neutrinos come from? Oh, right, during the He-3 formation, when a proton captures a helium-3, it forms a boron-8 which then decays into alpha particles and emits a neutrino. Or maybe it's during the deuterium formation steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the details wrong, but the key point is that the pp-III branch contributes to the neutrino production. So if that branch stops, the flux of neutrinos from that part would drop.

But wait, the problem says that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Oh, that's the time it takes for neutrinos to reach Earth. So the neutrinos produced right now are from the processes happening now. But if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have been emitted before that time. So neutrinos from the pp-III branch would be missing now.

Wait, no. The neutrinos take about 8.5 minutes to reach us, so if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted from the Sun during
