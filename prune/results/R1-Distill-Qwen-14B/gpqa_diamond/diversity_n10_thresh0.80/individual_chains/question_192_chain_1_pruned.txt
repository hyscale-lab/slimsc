Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a spherical conductor with some interesting setup. So, imagine a big sphere, radius R, and it's uncharged. Inside this big sphere, there's a small cavity. The cavity is also spherical, radius r, and its center is a distance s away from the big sphere's center. So, the cavity isn't at the center of the big sphere. The radius r is smaller than R, which makes sense because it's a cavity.

Now, they place a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the big sphere's center. But wait, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, both L and l are greater than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out the electric field at point P. I remember from Gauss's Law that the electric field outside a charged conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge. But wait, the big sphere is uncharged, right? So the conductor itself doesn't have any net charge. But there's this charge +q inside the cavity.

Wait, but when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface gets induced charges. Oh right, the inner surface would have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the enclosed charge. So, the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q because the conductor was initially neutral. Or wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. If you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it. So the total charge on the conductor is zero.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges would redistribute. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q because the conductor itself was neutral. Wait, no. No, wait. The conductor is neutral, so the sum of the induced charges must be zero. So, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, making the conductor's total charge zero.

So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor (since point P is outside, L > R), the field should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because, outside a spherical charge distribution, the field behaves as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the outer surface has a charge of +q. So, the field outside is that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. So, the electric field at point P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (L²), because L is the distance from the center of the big sphere to point P.

But wait, I'm not sure. Because the setup might be more complicated because the charge is placed inside a cavity that's not at the center. Would that affect the external field? I thought that for a conducting shell, the internal arrangement doesn't affect the external field. Because the charges on the outer surface are what contribute to the external field, and they distribute spherically symmetrically on the outer surface. So, regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge distribution remains the same.

So, the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't matter for the external electric field. So, the field at point P depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. Which is +q. So, the field E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options: option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That seems to fit.

Alternatively, let me think about the other options. Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared. That would be the case if the effective distance from
