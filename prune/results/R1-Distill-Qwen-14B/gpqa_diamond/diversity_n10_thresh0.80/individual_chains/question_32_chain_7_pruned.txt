Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So Li with 3 neutrons would be Li-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a moving particle is calculated using the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is given as 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. So v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Let me compute (0.96)^2: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me check that again. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is 3.571428... Yeah, that's right.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is Li-6, so I need its rest mass.

The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus. Wait, the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 6 nucleons. So 6 * 938 MeV is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the exact mass might be a bit less because the binding energy. But for heavy ions, the rest mass is often approximated as the sum of the individual nucleons. So I'll go with 6 * 938 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0c² = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me calculate that. 3.5714 * 5.628.

First, 3 * 5.628 is 16.884. Then 0.5714 *5.628:

0.5 *5.628=2.814. 0.0714 *5.628 ≈ 0.0714*5=0.357, and 0.0714*0.628≈0.045. So about 0.357 + 0.045=0.402. So total is 2.814 + 0.402≈3.216.

So 3.5714 *5.628 is approximately 16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's a quick approximation. Let me compute it precisely. Let me do 3.5714 *5.628.

Let me multiply 3.5714 *5.628.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.628 =16.884
0.5714 * 5.628:

0.5 *5.628 = 2.814
0.0714 *5.628 = let's compute 0.07 *5.628=0.394, and 0.0014 *5.628≈0.00788. So total ≈0.394 +0.00788=0.40188. So 0.5714 *5.628=2.814 + 0.40188=3.21588.

So adding to 16.884: 16.884 +3.21588=20.09988 GeV.

So approximately 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to my calculation. Option D is 21.419, which is higher. Option A is 18.475, which is much lower, and B is 23.069. So the closest is option C.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the rest mass? Because the exact mass of Li-6 is perhaps not exactly 6 * 938 MeV. Let me check. The actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 5.628 GeV/c²? Wait, the atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.015 u *931.5 MeV/u = approximately?

6.015 *93
