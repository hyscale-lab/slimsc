Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's interesting. So the line element depends on x and y coordinates. I remember that the area element in 2D space is typically dA = sqrt(-det(g)) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor. But wait, this is a metric in 2D, right? Because it's got dx² and dy².

So the metric tensor g in components would be a diagonal matrix where g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). The off-diagonal terms g_{xy} and g_{yx} are zero. So the determinant of the metric tensor g is the product of the diagonal elements, since it's diagonal. So det(g) = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

Wait, so the area element dA would be sqrt(-det(g)) dx dy. Wait, wait, but the metric here is for a 2-dimensional space. But wait, in a spacetime metric, the determinant's sign matters because of the metric signature. But in this case, the problem is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but perhaps here we're dealing with a 2D metric with a certain signature.

Wait, let me think. In 2D, the signature could be (+,+) for Riemannian or (+,-) for Lorentzian. Wait, no, in 2D, a pseudosphere would probably be a space with a metric of signature (-,+) or something else? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure, but maybe it doesn't matter right now. Let's proceed.

The area element is sqrt(-det(g)) dx dy. Wait, but for a Riemannian metric, the determinant is positive, and the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. But if the metric is Lorentzian, the determinant would be negative, so sqrt(-det(g)) would give a real number. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the given metric: the coefficients are positive, so perhaps it's a Riemannian metric. Because (4-x² - y²) in the denominator, and if 4 - x² - y² is positive, then the coefficient is positive, so the metric is Euclidean-like.

Wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So the domain of x² + y² is less than 4, so x² + y² <4. That makes sense because if x² + y² approaches 4 from below, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric blows up.

So the area element would then be sqrt(g_xx g_yy) dx dy, since the off-diagonal terms are zero. So sqrt( [32/(4 - x² - y²)] * [32/(4 - x² - y²)] ) ) = sqrt( (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2 ) = 32 / (4 - x² - y²).

So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So the area would be the integral of dA over the region where x² + y² <4. Because beyond that, the metric is undefined.

Wait, but the sphere of radius 2 would be x² + y² =4, but in this case, the domain is x² + y² <4, so the area would be the integral over the disk of radius 2 in x-y space, multiplied by the area element.

So the area A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, where the integral is over x² + y² <4.

Hmm, how do I compute that integral? Let's switch to polar coordinates because the integrand and the region are radially symmetric.

In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

We can separate the integrals:

A = 32 * ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

The θ integral is 2π, so:

A = 32 * 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

So now compute the radial integral: ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [1/u] * (-1/2) du.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du = (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

But wait, integrating from 4 to 0, and with the substitution, let's see:

Wait, let me do it step by step:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [r/(4-r²)] dr.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (r dr) = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [1/u] * (-1/2) du.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du.

But the integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so:

(-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. That's a problem. So the integral diverges to positive infinity because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up.

Wait, but the substitution gives:

The integral becomes [ (-1/2) (ln u) ) ] from 4 to 0.

Which is (-1/2)( ln 0 - ln4 ) = (-1/2)( -∞ - ln4 ) = (-1/2)(-∞) → positive infinity.

So the radial integral is ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 equals ∞. That means the area A is 32 * 2π * ∞ = ∞.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake? Because the integral is divergent, the area would be infinite. Hmm.

So the area of the pseudosphere with radius 2 is infinite, which would correspond to option D, which is +infty.

Wait, but why is it a pseudosphere? Or perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? So maybe the metric given is that of a pseudosphere.

Wait, the metric given is conformally flat in 2D. The line element is [32/(4 -x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I think this is the metric of a hyperbolic space, but in a certain coordinate system.

Wait, let me recall that hyperbolic space in 2D can be represented in various coordinates. For example, Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the Euclidean radial coordinate. Wait, but in our case, the metric is [32/(4 -r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), because dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ² in polar coordinates.

Wait, comparing to Poincaré disk, which is usually written with the metric [4/(1 - r^2)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), but our metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Let me see: 4 - r² is like 4(1 - (r²/4)), so 32/(4 - r^2) = 32/(4 (1 - r²/4)) ) ) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)).

Wait, the Poincaré disk has 4/(1 - r^2)^2, which is for the metric. So our metric is different. Because our denominator is 4 - r², which is 4(1 - r²/4). So 32/(4 - r²) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)).

Hmm, but regardless, the area computation came out as infinite. So the area is infinite, which would be option D.

Wait, but why is that? Because the pseudosphere is an infinite surface. Or maybe because the metric covers only a part of it.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is not the entire pseudosphere but a part of it, and the area is finite. Wait, but according to the integral, the area is infinite, so the answer would be D.

So looking back at the options:

Option D is +infty.

So the answer should be D.


The metric provided is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element \( dA \) using the metric. For a diagonal metric with \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{-\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \sqrt{g_{xx} g_{yy}} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The area is then given by integrating \( dA \) over the region where \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the metric is singular when \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \). Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \) separates, leaving:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), substitute \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[ \ln u \right]_4^0 = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \ln 0 - \ln 4 \right).
\]

As \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Thus, the area \( A \) becomes infinite:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \infty = +\infty.
\]

This divergence occurs because the metric describes a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, and such surfaces have infinite area. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
