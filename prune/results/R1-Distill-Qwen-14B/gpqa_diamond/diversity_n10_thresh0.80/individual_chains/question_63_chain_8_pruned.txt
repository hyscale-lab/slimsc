Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum mechanics. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum models, but I'll think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. It's in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. 

Wait, the fundamental stateâ€”I think that's the ground state. So when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state with the lowest energy. But wait, in quantum systems, transitions can be either vibrational or rotational. Since this model includes both, I need to figure out which transition is being referred to here.

The molecule is diatomic, X and Y. The given parameters are the masses of X and Y (20 amu and 2 amu), bond length (2 angstroms), and angular frequency (4e14 rad/s). 

So, the problem is about finding the photon's momentum. Photon momentum is related to its energy. Remember, E = pc, since for photons, energy is the product of momentum and the speed of light. So if I can find the energy of the photon, I can find p by dividing by c.

But what's the change in energy that the photon needs to supply? The molecule is in its fundamental state, and it's switching to the next state. I'm a bit confused about whether this is a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model might include both rotation and vibration. But the fundamental state is the state with the lowest energy. So, the next state would involve either a change in rotation, vibration, or both. But the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy," which suggests the smallest possible increase in energy. So the photon must provide the energy difference between the ground state and the next possible state.

Hmm, perhaps the next state is either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. But which requires less energy?

The energy levels in a diatomic molecule can be a combination of vibrational and rotational energies. Oh wait, the fundamental vibrational state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0), but the rotational states are quantized with levels characterized by angular momentum quantum numbers.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed as in the rigid rotor model. So the rotational energy depends on the bond's flexibility. But I
