Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the concentration of the free ions can be found using the formation constant, also known as the stability constant.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or protonation of the EDTA. The temperature is 25°C, but I think that's standard, so maybe the K value is given at that temperature.

The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Wait, K is the formation constant, right? So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K would be [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M.

We need to find the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²+], and presumably the EDTA as well, but since the problem only asks for calcium ions, that's the main focus.

So, the formation constant equation is:

K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) 

But wait, since the complex is
