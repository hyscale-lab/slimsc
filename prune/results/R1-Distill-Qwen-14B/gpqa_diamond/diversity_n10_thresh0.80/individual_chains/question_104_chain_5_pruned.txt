Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines indicates the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) )) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 AU)) ) * something? Wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the velocity amplitude and the orbital period.

Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula I think is K = (v) where v depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

Wait, let me think about the formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 AU) )

But for circular orbits, e is 0, so that term is 1. Also, since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the equation simplifies.

Wait, more accurately, the formula is:

K = [ ( (27 * pi) / (2 * c^3) ) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (P year) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. I think the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) )
