Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator, which is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. The operator is for a muon, but I think that detail might not matter much here—it's probably just about the operator's properties.

The question says the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, wait. Let me make sure I got that right. So the operator is P, and it's a vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz. So the direction is arbitrary, but the vector n is in the x-z plane. Hmm, that might mean the direction is at some angle θ from the z-axis, but I'm not sure yet how that plays into it.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator whose eigenvector we're looking for is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, because the problem says the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the operator is P · n, probably. Because in quantum mechanics, the operator for the component along a direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n.

So the operator is P · n, which would be nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction in the x-z plane would have the y-component as zero. So n can be written as (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. Oh, wait, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So perhaps we can write n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or maybe from the x-axis, but regardless, the y-component is zero.

But wait, the problem is asking for the eigenvector of this operator P · n with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector of the matrix P · n, which would be (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), since the y-component is zero.

So first, I think I should write down each of the given matrices for Px, Py, Pz.

Px is given as ħ/2 times a 2x2 matrix with first row [0,1] and second row [1,0]. So:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],
              [1, 0]]

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],
                        [i, 0]]

And Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],
                [0, -1]]

Wait, so each component is multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P · n would be nx Px + nz Pz, since ny=0.

Wait, but in the question, it says that the operator is for a muon. But I might not need to worry about that for finding the eigenvector.

So the operator in question is:

P ⋅ n = nx P_x + nz P_z.

So I need to find the eigenvector of this operator with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Hmm. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is (nx P_x + nz P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, but each of the P components has a factor of ħ/2. Let me think: P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], so the eigenvalue equation becomes:

(nx * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (nz * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]) ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

I can factor out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) [ nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[ nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]] ] |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix in the brackets is the one we're interested in. Let's write that matrix:

[[nz, nx],
 [nx, -nz]]

Because when you multiply nx by the P_x matrix (which is [[0,1],[1,0]]) and nz by the P_z matrix (which is [[1,0],[0,-1]]), you get:

The (1,1) element is nz * 1 + nx *0 = nz.

(1,2) is nz *0 + nx *1 = nx.

(2,1) is nx*1 + nz *0 = nx.

(2,2) is nx *0 + nz*(-1) = -nz.

So the matrix is [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

So the eigenvalue equation is:

[[nz, nx],
 [nx, -nz]] * [a; b] = [a; b], where [a; b] is the eigenvector.

So let's write the equations:

nz a + nx b = a → (nz -1) a + nx b =0.

nx a + (-nz) b = b → nx a + (-nz -1) b =0.

So two equations:

1) (nz -1) a + nx b =0.

2) nx a + (-nz -1) b =0.

Since it's an eigenvector, the equations shouldn't be independent; the determinant must be zero, but perhaps I can find a ratio between a and b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can subtract the two equations or find a relationship between a and b.

Let me take equation 1: (nz-1)a + nx b =0 → nx b = (1 - nz) a → b = [(1 - nz)/nx ] a.

Similarly, equation 2: nx a + (-nz -1) b =0 → nx a = (nz +1) b → b = (nx a)/(nz +1).

Wait, so from equation 1, b = [(1 - nz)/nx ] a.

From equation 2, b = [nx / (nz +1)] a.

Wait, so these two expressions for b must be equal: [(1 - nz)/nx ] a = [nx/(nz +1)] a.

Assuming a is not zero, we can divide both sides by a, getting:

(1 - nz)/nx = nx/(nz +1).

Cross-multiplying:

(1 - nz)(nz +1) = nx^2.

Let me expand the numerator:

(1)(nz +1) - nz (nz +1) = (nz +1) - nz^2 - nz = 1 - nz^2.

So the equation becomes (1 - nz^2) = nx^2.

But since n is a unit vector, nx^2 + nz^2 = 1 → nx^2 = 1 - nz^2.

So substituting into our earlier equation: 1 - nz^2 = nx^2 → which is indeed satisfied, so the two expressions for b are consistent.

So, from equation 1, b = (1 - nz)/nx * a.

But we can express this in terms of θ, perhaps, since n is in the x-z plane. Let me think: since n is in the x-z plane, we can write it as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no, let's think: for a unit vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so n can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So in that case, nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So substituting into the expression for b:

b = [ (1 - nz ) / nx ] a → [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a.

But I wonder if there's a trigonometric identity that can simplify this.

Hmm, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] = tan(θ/2).

So b = tan(θ/2) a.

So the ratio of b to a is tan(θ/2).

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as a [1; tan(θ/2)].

But we need to normalize it. Let's compute the normalization.

The vector is [a, a tan(θ/2)].

The inner product is a* a* [1 + tan²(θ/2)] = |a|^2 (1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) = |a|^2 sec²(θ/2).

To make the vector normalized, set |a|^2 sec²(θ/2) = 1 → |a|^2 = cos²(θ/2).

So a = sqrt(cos²(θ/2)) = cos(θ/2). Since we can take a as a real positive number.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, because a tan(θ/2) = cos(θ/2) * [ sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2) ] = sin(θ/2).

So the vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which looks like this.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which is more spherical harmonic-like but perhaps for a different scenario.

Wait, but wait a second. I assumed that n is in the x-z plane and expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but sometimes people parameterize in terms of angles differently. Alternatively, perhaps the vector is expressed as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but that would be in the x-z plane as well, but with θ measured from the x-axis. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that affects the result.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the direction is in the x-z plane. So the unit vector could be written as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since φ is zero (since it's in the x-z plane, so the direction is along x and z only, so φ=0 or φ=π, but perhaps it's arbitrary. But in any case, since the eigenvector comes out to be [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], I think that's the general form.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Hmm, but that's what I have. But let me think about the operator. Wait, the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Does this mean that the spin state is aligned with the direction n? Because in quantum mechanics, the spin operator along n has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles.

So for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvector for +ħ/2 along direction n is given by the spinor [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) e^{iφ} ] where θ and φ are the spherical angles of n.

Wait, but in this problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ=0 or something. So the eigenvector would have the form [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], assuming phi is zero.

But wait, the problem says it's a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, so the operator P is the spin operator. So the analysis I did should be correct.

So looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option A) (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar) → seems like specific values, not sure.

Option B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → more like the spherical harmonics, but perhaps for a different case.

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → which matches my result.

Option D) (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)) → scaled by sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but why?

Wait, why would the eigenvector have those scaling factors? Because I derived that the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C.

But wait, in the problem statement, the operator is P. Are we considering spin-1/2, so the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So yes, the eigenvector should be as I found.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector's scaling. Let me recheck the normalization.

The vector is [a, b], and the inner product is a² + b² =1.

In the case of the vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], the norm is cos^2(θ/2) + sin^2(θ/2) =1, so it's already normalized. So the correct normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which matches option C.

But then why is option D an option? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the choice of theta. Let me think again about how I parameterized n.

Wait, when n is in the x-z plane, I assumed n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but perhaps it's more correct to write it as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is measured from the x-axis.

Wait, because in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, but phi is the azimuthal angle. So for a direction in the x-z plane, phi=0, and theta is the angle from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ cos0, sinθ sin0, cosθ) → (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Ah, that's correct. So, if I use this parameterization, the eigenvector comes out as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But in this case, theta is the angle from the z-axis. So the first component is along x, and the second along z.

Wait, but in the context of spin-1/2, the eigenstates for spin along n are given by:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |−z>,

but in our case, since phi=0 because n is in the x-z plane, it becomes cos(theta/2)|+z> + sin(theta/2)|−z>.

But the basis here is the z-basis, so the state would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So that's correct. So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly this. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but the options don't have hbar in them. Oh, because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are usually written as spinors without the hbar because the spinor components are dimensionless. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait, let me check the options again. Option D has hbar multiplied in the components, but in my calculation, the eigenvector doesn't have hbar because it's a dimensionless quantity. So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, where $\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the components of $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, and $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are the spin operators given in the problem. Substituting the expressions for $P_x$ and $P_z$:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]

we find:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0.
\]

From these, the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is found to be:

\[
b = \frac{(1 - n_z)}{n_x} a.
\]

Since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, we can parameterize it as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, we find:

\[
b = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) a.
\]

The eigenvector can thus be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize this vector, we compute:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{a^2 \left[1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right]} = |a| \sec\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

Setting the norm to 1, we find $a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, and the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C. The other options are inconsistent with the derived eigenvector. For example:

- **Option A** and **Option D** include factors of $\hbar$, which are not part of the normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B** corresponds to spherical harmonics but does not match the derived spinor form.
- **Option C** is consistent with the derived normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
