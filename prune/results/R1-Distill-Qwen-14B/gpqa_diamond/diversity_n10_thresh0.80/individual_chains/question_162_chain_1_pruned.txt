Okay, so I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2 given the metric ds². Hmm, let me think about this step by step. 

First, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? And when we talk about the area of a pseudosphere, it's similar to finding the surface area of a sphere in Euclidean space but with a different metric.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I think this is in 2D, so maybe it's a 2-dimensional metric embedded in some higher-dimensional space. But for calculating area, I don't think the embedding is directly needed. 

Wait, the metric is in terms of x and y, so perhaps we can treat this as a 2D surface. To find the area, I should probably compute the area element using this metric. The area element in a 2D metric is given by sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy^2) dx dy. But in this case, the metric is diagonal, so the cross terms (g_xy and g_yx) are zero. 

Looking at the metric, the coefficients are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant of the metric tensor, which is g_xx * g_yy - (g_xy)^2, would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))² because g_xy is zero. 

Wait, but the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, which in this case is sqrt( (32/(4 - x² - y²))² ) dx dy. The square root of a square is the absolute value, so that's 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

So the area would be the integral of this over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator is 4 - x² - y²; that must be positive because otherwise the metric components would be negative or undefined. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but the radius in the problem is r=2. So the area we're looking for is the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that integral might be tricky. Maybe it's easier
