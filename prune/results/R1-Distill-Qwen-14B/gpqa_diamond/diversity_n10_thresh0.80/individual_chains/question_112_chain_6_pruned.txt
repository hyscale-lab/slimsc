Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Hmm. The state of the electron is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Oh wait, so |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The operator we're dealing with has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix with A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2 and A_11 = A_22 = 0. Hmm, that rings a bell. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices have 1s off the diagonal, but here it's hbar/2 instead. So the operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices are 2x2, right? So sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by hbar/2, it becomes [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]. So that's the operator we're looking at.

The question asks for the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A, then compute the probabilities based on the given |alpha> state.

But wait, let me think. Since A is proportional to sigma_x, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of sigma_x. Because if you have A = c * sigma_x, then the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's. So what are the eigenstates of sigma_x?

Sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. The corresponding eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for -1. Because sigma_x flips the spin in the x-direction, so its eigenstates are the |+x>
