Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass oscillates around an equilibrium point, like a mass on a spring. In the classical case, the potential energy is proportional to x squared, and the force is -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so things are going to get a bit more complicated.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. I think I need to recall how relativistic mechanics affects the problem. Oh right, in special relativity, as objects move faster, their mass increases, or rather, the relativistic mass increases. So the equations of motion would have to account for that.

Wait, but in some formulations, especially in modern physics, people use the invariant mass (rest mass) and don't talk about relativistic mass. Hmm, but I think for the purposes of this problem, we might be considering the relativistic mass because it's a 1D oscillator and the force is given as F = -kx, similar to the classical case.

So the setup is a 1D oscillator with mass m, maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is the same as the classical case. But because it's relativistic, the acceleration probably can't be treated the same way. Or perhaps the energy considerations change.

Wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So at maximum displacement (x=A), all potential energy (½ k A²) turns into kinetic energy (½ m v_max²), so v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), but that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case. So relativistic effects must change this.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just ½ mv². It's (gamma -1) mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but wait, wait— in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved. So at maximum displacement, the system's total energy is all potential, and at the equilibrium point (x=0), it's all kinetic.

Wait, no. In the classical case, the potential energy is maximum at x=A, so KE is zero there, and KE is maximum at x=0. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (½ mv²), so maybe the relation between potential and kinetic energy changes.

So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Let me think: E = gamma * m c² = K + U. At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so K=0, so U = E. But the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is U = ½ k x². Wait, but when x is large, relativistic effects may require a different form for U, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is still ½ k x², but the relation between E and velocity is different.

Wait, another approach: the total energy in relativity is given by E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)². But I'm not sure if momentum is involved here. Alternatively, the energy could be expressed in terms of velocity. Since the oscillator is moving, at any point, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, maybe I should model the system using energy conservation. At x=0, the mass is moving fastest. At x=A, it's at rest for an instant, so all the energy is potential. So the total energy E is equal to the potential energy at x=A, which is U = ½ k A².

Wait, but in the relativistic scenario, does the potential energy take the same form? Or does relativistic mechanics change the expression for potential energy? Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is still ½ k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy E would be (gamma) m c² = ½ k A².

Wait, no, because when x is maximum, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is just the potential energy at x=A, which is ½ k A². So E = ½ k A².

But at x=0, the potential energy is zero. So the kinetic energy is E, which is ½ k A². But kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma -1 ) m c². So:

½ k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At x=0, the velocity is maximum, so we can write:

½ k A² = ( (1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) ) - 1 ) m c².

Hmm. Let me write that equation again:

(1/2) k A² = ( (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) m c².

We can rearrange this to solve for v. Let's let v = v_max, the maximum speed.

Let me denote gamma as gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the equation becomes:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

We can solve for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me check:

gamma = [ (1/2) k A² ) / (m c²) ] + 1.

Because 1/2 k A² = (gamma - 1) m c² => gamma -1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²) => gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, but what if the units don't match? Wait, k has units of N/m, which is kg/s². So k A² has units kg/s² * m² = kg m²/s², which is N m, which is J. So 1/2 k A² is energy. Similarly, m c² has units J. So the division is correct.

So gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But then gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but that would make gamma larger than 1, which is correct because the mass is moving relativistically.

Let me solve for v_max.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, let's say alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + alpha.

Therefore, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1+alpha).

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranging:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2] = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Compute numerator: (1 + 2 alpha + alpha²) - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha².

So:

v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ].

Factor numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha) ... Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to write in terms of alpha.

Wait, but alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Maybe we can factor that in.

But let's proceed step by step.

So,

v² = c² * [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, let me compute (2 alpha + alpha²) as alpha (2 + alpha). But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, we can write:

(2 alpha + alpha²) = alpha (alpha + 2) = alpha ( (1 + alpha) + 1 ).

But perhaps it's easier to just keep it as is.

So,

v² = c² * [ alpha (alpha + 2) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Alternatively, let's express it in terms of (1 + alpha):

Wait, let me think. Let me take the fraction:

(2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, (alpha + 2) = (1 + alpha) + 1.

Wait, perhaps I can split the fraction:

[ alpha (1 + alpha) + 2 alpha ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

[ alpha (alpha + 2) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 = [ alpha ( (1 + alpha) + 1 ) ] / ( 1 + alpha )^2.

Which would be [ alpha (1 + alpha) + alpha ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

So that's [ alpha (1 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 ) + alpha / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is [ alpha / (1 + alpha) ) ] + [ alpha / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ].

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should just proceed to find the expression for v.

But perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but in relativistic terms.

So the potential energy at x = A is U = (1/2)k A².

The kinetic energy when moving at v_max is (gamma - 1) m c².

So, ½ k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

Which gives gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ), same as before.

So gamma = 1 + alpha, where alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Let me solve for v.

First, invert both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranged:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

We can write this as:

v² = c² [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ].

Compute numerator:

(1 + alpha)^2 - 1 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v² = c² ( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this form. Let me compute alpha in terms of the given variables.

Alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

2 alpha = (k A²)/(m c²).

Let me factor alpha^2:

alpha² = (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

v² = c² [ ( (k A²)/(m c²) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ].

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe I can factor out (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) from numerator and denominator.

Let me denote beta = (k A^2)/(m c^2).

So,

2 alpha = beta,

alpha = beta/2.

So,

v² = c² [ (beta/2 * (2 + beta/2) ) ] / (1 + beta/2 )^2.

Wait, perhaps that's a better way.

Wait, let's compute numerator terms.

Wait, v² = c² ( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Substituting alpha = beta / 2:

2 alpha = beta,

alpha^2 = (beta^2) /4,

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2 = (1 + beta/2)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ (beta + beta²/4 ) ] / (1 + beta/2 )^2.

Factor beta in numerator:

beta (1 + beta/4) / denominator.

Hmm, but this may not lead anywhere directly. Let me try to manipulate the expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 2 alpha + alpha² as alpha (2 + alpha).

So,

v² = c² [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But since alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is (1/2) beta, where beta = k A²/(m c²).

Hmm, perhaps I can write the expression as:

v² = c² [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But let's substitute alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c^2):

v² = c² [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator terms:

The numerator inside the brackets becomes:

= (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ]

= (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, because 2 is (4 m c²)/(2 m c²), right? So,

= (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²).

Multiply these:

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / [ (2 m c²) * (2 m c^2) ) ]

Denominator is (2 m c²)^2=4 m² c^4.

So numerator is k A² (4 m c² + k A²).

So the numerator becomes:

k A² (4 m c² + k A²) / (4 m² c^4).

So,

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) / (4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ]

Simplify denominator:

Denominator is:

(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

So,

Denominator = (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (2 m c²)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) / (4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the division:

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So,

v² = c² * [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) / (4 m² c^4) ) ] * [4 m² c^4 / (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ) ]

The 4 m² c^4 in the numerator and denominator cancel out.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

Hmm, let's factor 4 m c² + k A² as (2 m c² + (k A² + 2 m c²)). Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, note that (4 m c² + k A²) = 2*(2 m c²) + k A², but not sure.

Wait, let me factor out (2 m c²) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator inside brackets is k A² (4 m c² + k A²) = k A² (2 m c² * 2 + k A²).

Denominator is (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

But perhaps I can factor 2 m c² from numerator and denominator.

Let me factor 2 m c² from (4 m c² + k A²) = 2 m c² (2) + k A².

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let me write it as:

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

I can factor the denominator as (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

Wait, perhaps I can write (4 m c² + k A²) = 2 m c² * 2 + k A². Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can write (4 m c² + k A²) = 2*(2 m c²) + k A².

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v² = c² * [ k A² [ 2*(2 m c²) + k A² ] ] / (2 m c² + k A²)^2.

Not sure if that helps. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/( (1 - (k A²)/(2 m) )^2 ) )

Wait, but in our case, we have terms involving (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so perhaps the denominator in the options have terms with (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)).

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) )).

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ) )

Wait, let's compute what I have for v. Let me take square roots now.

We have:

v² = c² [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / (1 + alpha)^2,

where alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v² = c² * [ (2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2.

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A^2/(2 m c²)) = (k A^2)/(m c²) = beta.

And (k A^2/(2 m c²))^2 = (beta^2)/4.

So numerator is beta + (beta^2)/4.

Denominator is (1 + beta/2)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ ( beta + beta²/4 ) ] / (1 + beta/2 )^2.

Which is,

v² = c² [ beta (1 + beta/4) ) ] / (1 + beta/2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps another way to write this.

Wait, let me factor beta from numerator:

beta (1 + beta/4 ) = beta ( (4 + beta) /4 ) = beta (4 + beta) / 4.

So,

v² = c² [ beta (4 + beta) /4 ] / ( (1 + beta/2 )^2 ).

But 1 + beta/2 = (2 + beta)/2.

So denominator is ( (2 + beta)/2 )^2 = (2 + beta)^2 /4.

So,

v² = c² [ ( beta (4 + beta) /4 ) ] / ( (2 + beta)^2 /4 ).

The 4 in numerator and denominator cancel.

v² = c² [ beta (4 + beta) ) ] / ( (2 + beta)^2 ).

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ beta (4 + beta) ) ] / ( (2 + beta)^2 ) )

Hmm, let's take the square root:

v = c * [ sqrt( beta (4 + beta) ) ] / (2 + beta).

But I'm not sure if this simplifies further.

Wait, let's compute beta = (k A^2)/(m c^2).

So,

beta = (k A^2)/(m c^2).

Hmm, let me substitute back into the expression:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) * (4 + (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) ] ) / ( 2 + (k A^2)/(m c^2) )

Simplify inside the square root:

= sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2) * (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(m c^2) ) )

Which is sqrt( [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ] / (m^2 c^4) )

So,

= sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ] ) / ( m c^2 )

But this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

In the beginning, I considered that the total energy E is ½ k A², which equals (gamma -1) m c² at x=0.

But wait, is that correct? Because in the relativistic case, the potential energy might not be ½ k A². Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator is different.

Wait, another approach: the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is more complicated. I think I remember that the equation involves terms like d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

Wait, the force F = -k x, which in relativistic terms would be F = d(momentum)/dt.

Momentum p = gamma m v.

So F = d(p)/dt = d(gamma m v)/dt = m d(gamma v)/dt.

But F is given as -k x.

So,

m d(gamma v)/dt = -k x.

But this is a differential equation. It's more complicated than the classical case.

I'm not sure if I can solve this without more advanced techniques, but perhaps there's a way to find the maximum speed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of energy. The total energy E of the system is conserved. At the maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. So E = ½ k A^2 (assuming still the classical potential form). But wait, in reality, the potential energy might have a different form in the relativistic case. Hmm, perhaps I'm making an assumption here that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator isn't ½ k x². If that's the case, then my earlier approach is flawed.

Hmm, maybe I need to look for a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed is given by the condition that the centripetal acceleration doesn't exceed the relativistic limit, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: In the relativistic case, the maximum speed can't exceed c. So all the options have v_max less than c? Or perhaps not.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C is sqrt(k A^2/m), which in the non-relativistic case is correct. The other options involve factors of c, so they might approach this when k A^2 is small compared to m c².

Wait, but in the non-relativistic limit, when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) is small, so alpha is small, so gamma is approximately 1 + alpha.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 ≈ c^2 (2 alpha) [since alpha^2 is negligible].

So,

v ≈ c sqrt( 2 alpha ) = c sqrt( 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) = c sqrt( (k A^2)/( m c^2 ) ) = sqrt( k A^2 / m ) = option C.

So when velocities are non-relativistic, option C is correct. So the correct answer must reduce to option C when the relativistic effects are negligible.

Looking at the options:

Option C is correct in the non-relativistic case, but when relativistic effects are considered, the other options are possibilities.

So, which of the other options when expanded in terms of a small alpha (i.e., (k A²)/(2 m c²) is small) will reduce to option C?

Let me compute each option for small alpha.

Option A:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/( (1 - alpha )^2 )

For small alpha, 1/(1 - alpha)^2 ≈ 1 + 2 alpha + 3 alpha² + ... .

So,

v ≈ c sqrt( 1 + 1 + 2 alpha ) = c sqrt( 2 (1 + alpha) ) ≈ c sqrt(2) sqrt(1 + alpha ) ≈ c sqrt(2) [1 + alpha/2 ].

But when alpha is small, this would be v ≈ c sqrt(2) (1 + alpha/2 ), which is larger than option C's sqrt(k A^2/m) which is sqrt( (alpha * 2 m c^2) )? Not sure, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c^2). So 2 alpha = (k A²)/(m c^2), so sqrt(2 alpha) is sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2) ), which is sqrt(k A²/(m c²)) = (A sqrt(k/(m))) ) / c.

Hmm, but when alpha is small, the maximum speed is sqrt( (k A^2)/(m) ), which is option C.

Option B:

v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - alpha )).

For small alpha, 1/(1 - alpha ) ≈ 1 + alpha.

So,

1 + 1/(1 - alpha ) ≈ 2 + alpha.

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt( 2 + alpha ).

But for small alpha, this would give a velocity larger than c * sqrt(2), which is bigger than c, but this would violate the speed limit. So this can't be correct.

Wait, no, because when alpha is small, 1/(1 - alpha ) is ~1 + alpha, so 1 + 1/(1 - alpha ) = 2 + alpha. So sqrt(2 + alpha ) is not larger than sqrt(2), but it's more than sqrt(2). But in reality, the velocity must approach option C when alpha is small, which is sqrt(k A²/m) = sqrt( (2 m c^2 alpha ) ), because alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, let me compute sqrt(k A²/m) in terms of alpha:

sqrt( (k A^2)/(m) ) = sqrt( (2 m c^2 alpha) ), since alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c²) → k A^2 = 2 m c^2 alpha. So,

sqrt(k A^2/m ) = sqrt( (2 m c^2 alpha) / m ) ) = sqrt( 2 c^2 alpha ) = c sqrt( 2 alpha ).

So, when alpha is small, the velocity in option C is v_C = c sqrt(2 alpha ), which is about c * sqrt(2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )) = c * sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2) ), which matches.

Now, option B's expression:

v_B = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - alpha) ) ≈ c sqrt( 2 + alpha ).

Wait, but for small alpha, this would be approximately c sqrt(2) (1 + alpha/(4) )... which is higher than c sqrt(2 alpha) when alpha is small.

But when alpha is small, the actual maximum speed is option C, which is c sqrt(2 alpha). So this suggests that option B doesn't reduce to option C, so it's probably incorrect.

Option D:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha )^2 )

For small alpha, 1/(1 + alpha )^2 ≈ 1 - 2 alpha.

So,

1 - [1/(1 + alpha )^2 ] ≈ 1 - (1 - 2 alpha ) ) = 2 alpha.

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt( 2 alpha ), which is the same as option C. So option D reduces to option C in the small alpha limit.

So this suggests that option D could be the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I had an expression for v² in terms of alpha. Let me see if option D's expression matches that.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ) )

Which is,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + alpha )^2 ) )

Which is,

v_max = c sqrt( [ (1 + alpha )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2 )

= c sqrt( [ 2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha )^2 )

Which matches the expression I derived earlier for v. So this must be option D.

But wait, looking back, my final expression for v² was:

v² = c² * (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha )^2.

Which is exactly what option D's expression gives, because:

v_max^2 = c² * ( [ (1 + alpha )^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha )^2 )

= c² * ( 2 alpha + alpha² ) / (1 + alpha )^2.

So yes, option D is correct.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and force \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and includes both potential energy and relativistic kinetic energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential energy:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   At \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy at \( x = 0 \) to the potential energy at \( x = A \), we have:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Rearranging for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha}.
   \]  
   Squaring again:  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( v^2 \):  
   \[
   v^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2} \right).
   \]  
   Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   v^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2} \right).
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

3. **Verification of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Does not match the derived expression.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect because it does not reduce to the non-relativistic result \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \) in the limit \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \to 0 \).  
   - **Option C**: Correct in the non-relativistic limit but does not account for relativistic effects.  
   - **Option D**: Matches the derived expression exactly and reduces to the non-relativistic result \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \) when \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \to 0 \).

### Conclusion:
The correct expression for the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by **Option D**.
