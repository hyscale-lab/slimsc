Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down what each step does and what the products might be. Then, I'll look at the spectral data to figure out the structure of each product, especially product 3, and determine its NMR coupling pattern.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is a bicyclic structure, kind of like four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions have bromine atoms.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So, probably a ketone or maybe an ester. But since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But wait, in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Those bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So elimination might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution, but with two leaving groups, perhaps a double elimination or some kind of ring opening.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation but in such a way that forms a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form a carbonyl group. Let me think. Another possibility is that each Br is replaced by OH, but that would give diol, but the IR would show O-H stretches, which are usually broad. But the IR here shows a strong peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's an epoxide? No, because epoxide IR would have a peak around 1250, I think.

Wait, another possibility: If two adjacent Br atoms are present, they could eliminate to form an alkene. But since they're 1 and 3, maybe it's not adjacent. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a double elimination, removing both Br atoms and forming two alkenes, but that might result in a conjugated diene. But then, why the IR peak for a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diels-alder type reaction? Not sure. Wait, but wait, another thought: Maybe each Br is replaced by a hydroxide, but that would require a substitution. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would form 1,3-diol. But the IR doesn't suggest that. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the KOH is deprotonating something. Oh, wait, when dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes they can form a ketone if the structure allows. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond, but if they're two positions apart, perhaps a cyclic transition state allows for a conjugated elimination.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to two or three others in a very rigid framework. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. If KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination, removing two Br atoms and forming a carbonyl group.

Ah! Oh, wait, I remember that in some cases, treating a dihalide with a strong base can lead to the formation of a ketone via a mechanism called the Pummerer rearrangement. But wait, the Pummerer rearrangement is when a haloform (like a methyl halide with more substituents) rearr
