Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying a chemical compound based on its spectral data. Let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through carefully.

First, the question gives me some data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to figure out the molecular formula from the options given: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let's start with the FTIR. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak is typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids, but if it's very broad and strong, maybe it's an alcohol. Alternatively, an O-H stretch in carboxylic acids is usually broader and around 2500-3300, but I might be mixing that up. Wait, the peak here is at 3000, which is a bit on the higher side. Could also be an alcoholic O-H, but sometimes they are a bit lower. Hmm.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those peaks are in the range of carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl like a ketone or an ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 suggests maybe an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl. Wait, but 1700 is more like a carbonyl (C=O), and 1650 could be a conjugated double bond or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl like an ester or a ketone and an adjacent group causing a shift.

Wait, in IR, the carbonyl stretching frequency can vary. For example, a ketone is around 1700-1750, esters around 1730-1750, maybe. Wait, but in the question, 1700 is the higher value. So perhaps an ester or a ketone. The 1650 peak could be from conjugation, like an aromatic ring with a substituent. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe an alpha, beta-uns
