Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states a few things:

1. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2.
2. Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2.
3. The wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody is related to its temperature by Wien's Law. So maybe that's important here.
4. Their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. Hmm, radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but since the question is about their actual luminosities, maybe we can ignore that for calculating luminosity. Or wait, luminosity is intrinsic, so maybe the velocities are a red herring unless they affect temperature. Hmm, not sure yet.
5. The key point is that they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. We need to find that factor.

Wait, the question says they computed the luminosity using the blackbody radiation, so I should probably use the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Stefan-Boltzmann says that the luminosity L is proportional to the radius squared times the temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since we're comparing two stars, the 4πσ factors will cancel out, so L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

So I need to find R1, R2, T1, and T2. The problem gives R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Now the temperatures: since the peak wavelengths are the same, Wien's law tells me λ_max * T = constant. So if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 = T2. Wait, but that can't be right because if their temperatures are the same and radius is larger, then luminosity would be higher. But wait, wait, no, because the problem says the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, but that's the observed wavelength, which might be affected by their velocities.

Wait, wait, I remember that the observed wavelength is different from the emitted wavelength due to Doppler shift. So if a star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity), the observed wavelength would be shorter than the emitted, and if moving away, longer. But wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Since Star_1's velocity is zero, its observed wavelength is the same as the emitted. But Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, which direction? The problem doesn't say, but the radial velocity is 700 for Star_2. Let me think about whether it's moving towards us or away.

Wait, radial velocity is the component along
