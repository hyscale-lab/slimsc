Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's take a deep breath and think this through step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The setup is that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is Ca-EDTA, I think the formula is CaY²- or something like that. Wait, the problem says it's a stochiometric complex, so the ratio is 1:1. So the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²- or maybe CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant, K, is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number. I recall that a large K means the complex is stable and forms to a great extent. So most of the Ca²+ ions would be tied up in the complex, leaving very little free Ca²+ in solution. That's probably relevant to the answer.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions. So I think the approach here is to use the formation constant expression. Let me write down what I know: the formation constant K is for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K is [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA is not all in the EDTA^4- form. EDTA is a polyprotic acid, and its form depends on the pH. Oh wait, the question says the pH is ideal, so maybe we don't need to worry about the different protonated forms. That probably means we can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- is equal to the total EDTA concentration. So that might simplify things.

Wait, but wait. The solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Since the complex is formed 1:1 with Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be important. But wait, when the complex forms, it's using up Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So initially, if the solution is just the complex, then the free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be determined by the K value.

So let's model this. Let me denote:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

We can write the formation equation as:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2- ; K = 5e10.

So the expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

We need to find [Ca²+], which is the free calcium ion concentration.

But wait, what's the
