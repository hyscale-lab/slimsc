Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the structure of the crystal. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Wait, rhombohedral means all the edges are equal and all the angles are the same, right? So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. I think interatomic distance here refers to the lattice parameter 'a' because in rhombohedral structures, all sides are the same length.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. The formula I recall is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hkl)(cos α + cos β + cos γ) ) / (something?), wait no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, no, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) ), but wait, actually I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, for a general rhombohedral system, there's a specific formula. I think it's d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos θ) + 2(hl cos θ) + 2(kl cos θ) ), because in a rhombohedral crystal, all three angles are equal, right? Since α=β=γ=30°, so cos θ is cos(30°).

Wait but wait, another approach: The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + ... Hmm, maybe I should look up the formula again. Alternatively, I remember that for a cubic system, the formula is simpler, d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But since this is a rhombohedral system, not cubic, the formula must account for the angles.

Oh right! The general formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l
