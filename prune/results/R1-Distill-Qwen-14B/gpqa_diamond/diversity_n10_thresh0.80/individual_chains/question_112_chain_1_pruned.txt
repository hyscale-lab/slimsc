Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me go through what's given and what I need to find.

The problem says that |alpha> is an electron state proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, maybe I should normalize this state because probabilities are easier to handle with normalized states.

Then, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator's matrix is given with elements A_ij: it's hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that’s a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin up and down. So let me write that out. The matrix would look like this:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

So this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, what kind of operator is this? It looks familiar. Oh wait, this is similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on diagonal. So A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Now, the eigenstates of sigma_x are known. For sigma_x, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So the eigenstates of operator A are the same as those of sigma_x, just scaled by hbar/2. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. So its eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), right? Because sigma_x has eigenvalues 1 and -1. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) respectively. Because sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, etc.

But wait, the problem is phrased a bit differently. It says, "the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is A." So we don't need to look for the eigenstates; we can use the fact that the operator is proportional to sigma_x, so the eigenstates are the standard spin-x states.

The question now is, given that |alpha> is in a certain state, we need to find the probability of measuring it in each of these eigenstates. So we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients will give us the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the overlap of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A. The square of the magnitude of the overlap gives the probability.

But first, let's normalize |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

Coefficient of |up> is (1+i). Its magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Coefficient of |down> is (2 - i). Its magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Hence, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write them out. |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of these eigenstates to find the coefficients. The probabilities will be the square of the absolute values of these coefficients.

First, compute < +x | alpha >.

So, < +x | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

Wait, no, wait: |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by |alpha>.

So,

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) * <up|up> + ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7)
