Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so when there are no spots compared to when there are.

Wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So, the ratio without spots is higher than when spots are present. We need to find (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots) = factor.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Oh, right, I remember that the ionization and excitation of atoms in stars depend a lot on temperature. Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), we can probably use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors), E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, in this problem, the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when spots are present. Oh, wait, the question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots is the factor, which is the same as [(n1/n2)_no_spots] divided by [(n1/n2)_with_spots].

But using the Boltzmann equation, let me think. Let me write the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Because (n1)/(n2) = [g1 exp(-E1/(kT))]/[g2 exp(-E2/(kT))] ] = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ).

So, the ratio n1/n2 depends on the exponential term. Since E2 is higher than E1 (because they're different energy levels and assuming level 2 is higher), the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) is positive. So as temperature decreases, the exponential term decreases because the denominator (kT) is smaller, making the entire exponent larger and the exponential smaller.

Wait, wait: Let me clarify. (E2-E1) is positive. So if T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k*T) becomes larger, so exp( (
