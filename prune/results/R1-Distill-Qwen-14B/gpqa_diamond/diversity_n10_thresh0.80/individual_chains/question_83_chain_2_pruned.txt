Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

So, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So, when they react, they form sodium acetate and water. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH to form the acetate ion. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, the solution should be basic. So, the pH at equivalence point should be above 7. Let me see the options: options A and D have equivalence points at 8.52 and 6.92, respectively. Wait, option D's equivalence point is 6.92, which is just below 7. That doesn't make sense because acetate should make the solution basic. So maybe I need to think again.

Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake. Let's calculate it properly. So, first, let's find out the moles involved.

The initial moles of acetic acid: volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) times 0.05 M. So 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 moles.

When we dilute it with 20 cm³ water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration of acetic acid becomes 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, is that right? Or wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ 0.05 M, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, when diluted to 40 cm³, concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 =
