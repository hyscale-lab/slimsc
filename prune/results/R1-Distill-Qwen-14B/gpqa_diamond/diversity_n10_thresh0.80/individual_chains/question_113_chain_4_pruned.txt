Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound. The question gives me some spectroscopic data, and I have to choose between four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably an O-H stretch, which suggests the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. But wait, there's also a peak at 1700 cm^-1. That region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300 cm^-1, which fits the first peak. However, their carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1 as well. But then there's another peak at 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, that's a bit lower than a typical ketone. Could that be an ester or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or perhaps an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen. Wait, another possibility: the 1650 cm^-1 might be a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester, or maybe a carbonyl adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are typically in the range of around 4.5-7 ppm, and that indicates the presence of a double bond, maybe an alkene. So the compound has a double bond.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2O or maybe a CH3CO group. Alternatively, it could be from a carbonyl-containing fragment. For instance, if you have a ketone, the (CH3)2CO would lose the CO to give (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 12*2 + 1*6 +16 = 45). Or maybe it's an acetyl group breaking off.

Now, let's think about the possible molecular formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

The degrees of unsaturation can help here. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Let's compute for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2
Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So either a ring and a double bond, or just one double bond and perhaps an oxygen ring? But O doesn't contribute to DoU as a ring unless it's part of a cyclic ether or something. Hmm, but perhaps if the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Wait, but the IR showed a carbonyl. Maybe a ring plus a carbonyl group.

Option B: C6H10O
DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds. But the NMR shows a vinyl group (so at least one double bond), so maybe one ring and one double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2
DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. So same as B, but with another O. Hmm, could be two rings, or one ring and two double bonds, but that's less likely. Alternatively, one ring, and one double bond, plus an oxygen somewhere.

Option D: C6H12O
DoU: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So one ring or double bond.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have vinyl hydrogens, so we know there's at least one double bond. So the compound must have a DoU that accounts for that, plus any rings or other groups.

Looking back at the IR: the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an O-H group. So the compound is either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would have a
