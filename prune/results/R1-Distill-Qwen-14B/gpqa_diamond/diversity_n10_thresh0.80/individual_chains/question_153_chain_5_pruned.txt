Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to a β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion, right? So the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β position of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl.

The problem has three parts: reactions (A), (B), and (C), and I need to determine the products for each. Then, I have to match them with the options provided (A, B, C, D).

Let's start with each reaction one by one.

**Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)**

Hmm, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester of malonic acid. When treated with a base like NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), it should form an enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon (since it's 3-(p-tolyl), I think the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C3). Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The formula for methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would have the substituent on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3. So the substituent is on the third carbon? Or is it on the second? Let me draw it out. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituent (p-tolyl) is on C3? Wait no, in methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the substituent is on the same carbon as the double bond. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C2.

Wait, maybe I should think about the position. For acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the substituent in 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be on the third carbon from the ester group. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The substituent is on the α,β-unsaturated carb
