Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and after reaction with certain reagents, I need to find the final product. The options are four different compounds, so I'll need to figure out the structure of the starting material and then track the reactions.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I need to figure out what this structure is. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO.

Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here, so:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (3 double bonds equivalent) plus a double bond or ring, and maybe an amine or something else. But wait, the N is in the formula, so it's probably part of an amide or amine.

Looking at the NMR, the peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t). That's a high chemical shift, which suggests it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests it's coupling with two equivalent protons. Hmm, but wait, an aldehyde has a single proton, so if it's a triplet, maybe it's coupled to two adjacent protons, like in a conjugated system.

Then at 6.98 and 6.51, both doublets, each integrating to 2H. These are likely aromatic protons. The 6.98 is more deshielded, which is typical for o, m, or p positions relative to substituents. The 6.51 is a bit downfield but not as much as 6.98. So maybe two aromatic rings, each with substituents. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diphenyl compound with some substituents. The 6.98 and 6.51 are each two protons. Let me think about para-substituted benzene rings. For example, a para-substituted benzene would have two protons as a doublet. But wait, each ring would have two protons? Wait, no, a para-substituted benzene has two sets of equivalent protons: the protons adjacent to the substituent would be a pair, and the ones opposite would be another pair.
