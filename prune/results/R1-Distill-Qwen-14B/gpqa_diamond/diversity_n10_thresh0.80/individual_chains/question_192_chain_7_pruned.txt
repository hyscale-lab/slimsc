Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me see what I can remember. The question involves an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. The setup is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

So the conductor is spherical with radius R, and inside it there's a smaller spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and its center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The conductor itself is uncharged at the start, but then a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, the angle between l and s (the separation between the centers) is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside.

I remember that when dealing with conductors, the charges can redistribute themselves. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Wait, how does that work again?

Oh right, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor as a whole was neutral. So the inner surface must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface would then have +q to balance it out because the total charge must remain zero. Or wait, no. Wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So when you put +q inside, the inner surface must have -q, and then the outer surface will have +q because the total charge of the conductor is zero? Or wait, no, because the conductor itself is neutral. Hmm, wait, no. The conductor is neutral, so when +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material (since it's a conductor, the field must be zero inside it). So the inner surface has -q, which means the outer surface must have +q because the total charge on the conductor is zero (since it started uncharged and +q is inside, the conductor's net charge is zero, so outer surface has +q).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. When you
