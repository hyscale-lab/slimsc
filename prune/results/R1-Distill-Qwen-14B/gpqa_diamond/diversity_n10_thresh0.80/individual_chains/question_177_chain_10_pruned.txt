Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- They found that both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. That probably relates to their temperatures, since the peak wavelength of emission for a black body is given by Wien's Law. So, λ_max1 = λ_max2.
- The radial velocities are given: Star_1 is stationary (0 km/s) and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh right, Doppler shift. But wait, the problem says they found the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So I think the observed wavelengths are the same, which might imply that the intrinsic (rest) wavelengths are different. Or maybe I'm getting that backwards.

Wait, the question is about their luminosities. The astronomers computed that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a certain factor. The options are all around 2.2 or so, so not too big.

So I need to compute L1 / L2.

I remember that the luminosity of a star (as a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, R the radius, and T the effective temperature.

So L is proportional to R² T⁴. So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, R1² = (2.25) R2². So R part is (2.25)^(1) = 2.25.

Now, the T part. Since the stars radiate as black bodies, their peak wavelengths are determined by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K). 

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. But wait, does that mean the observed wavelength or the intrinsic (rest) wavelength?

Ah, because Star 2 is moving with a radial velocity, there's a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength for Star 2 would be different. So if the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, then their intrinsic (rest) λ_max must be different.

Let me think about that. The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the intrinsic wavelength λ_rest by the Doppler formula. For a star moving away, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But for Star_2, v_r is positive 700 km/s (assuming it's moving away). Star_1 has v_r
