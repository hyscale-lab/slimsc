Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that the harmonic oscillator is a common problem in quantum mechanics, but this seems more like a classical mechanics question with a relativistic twist.

The question says it's a one-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So, it's the same as the classical harmonic oscillator but in the relativistic context. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy at max speed is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which would be option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case.

But the question is relativistic. Oh right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the total energy in the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy when moving at speed v.

Wait, no, the oscillator's energy isn't just the sum like that. Wait, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. Then, as it moves towards the equilibrium, the potential energy converts into kinetic energy. At the equilibrium point, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic, which would be the maximum speed point.

But in the relativistic case, the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic) isn't conserved in the same way as non-relativistic. Hmm, wait, maybe the system's total energy is conserved. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy of the oscillator would then be the sum of rest energy and the potential energy? Or is it that the total energy is just the potential energy plus kinetic, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is more than just (1/2)mv².

Wait, perhaps we should consider the total mechanical energy of the oscillator
