Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m and are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are given, so I need to calculate both the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relativistic speeds... Right, I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics. You have to use Einstein's theory of relativity. So, for velocities, I'll probably need the relativistic velocity addition formula, and for energy, the total relativistic energy formula.

Let me tackle the relative speed first. The question is, what is the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference? Because each astronaut is in their own frame, moving relative to each other.

Wait, no. Wait, no. The problem is about the relative speed. Oh, but wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting velocities. Because velocities don't simply add up normally when they're close to c. So I should use the formula for relative velocity.

The formula for the relative velocity u' between two objects moving at u and v in the same direction is given by: 

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²))

Wait, wait, actually, I might have that wrong. Let me think. The formula for the relative velocity when two frames are moving at u and v. Oh wait, no, wait. The formula for the velocity of an object in one frame as seen from another frame moving at velocity v is:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, one astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the other at 0.5c. So if I want the relative speed of the 0.6c astronaut as seen from the 0.5c astronaut's frame, I should plug u=0.6c and v=0.5c into the formula.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from
