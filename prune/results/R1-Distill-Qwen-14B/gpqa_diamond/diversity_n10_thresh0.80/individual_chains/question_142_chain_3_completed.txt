Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit unsure where to start. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubit space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are different r values in a 3D space, I think. Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, how do these matrices translate into geometrical positions?

I seem to recall that a qubit's state can be represented as a point on a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation used in quantum mechanics to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. So, a density matrix for a mixed state would correspond to a point inside the sphere, while a pure state would be on the surface.

Looking at the given density matrix, ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Wait, that looks like a diagonal matrix. Let me write it out in matrix form. |0⟩ is [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1, 0],[0, 0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

Wait a second, I remember that the density matrix for a completely mixed state (like a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩) should be this. Because if you have a completely mixed state, it's ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|), which is exactly what's given here. So this is a maximally mixed state.

Now, how does this relate to the Bloch sphere? The Bloch vector representation comes into play here. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z), and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) that points to a point on the Bloch sphere for pure states, or inside for mixed states.

Let me apply this formula. Our ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is equal to (I)/2. So, substituting into the formula:

(I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2 → I/2 = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So each term would contribute to the matrix. For the sum to be zero matrix, each coefficient must be zero. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. 

Therefore, the vector r is (0, 0, 0), which is the origin in the Bloch sphere. So the point is at the center of the sphere. That makes sense because the maximally mixed state has no coherence and is equally in |0⟩ and |1⟩, so its representation is at the center.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that must be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with elements \(\rho_{00} = 0.5\) and \(\rho_{11} = 0.5\), and zeros elsewhere. This represents a maximally mixed state, which is an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). 

In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a single qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector that determines the position of the state in the Bloch sphere. For the given \(\rho\), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

Substituting this into the Bloch sphere formula:

\[
\frac{1}{2} I = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right).
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
I = I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}.
\]

Subtracting \(I\) from both sides:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

This implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) are zero (\(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), \(r_z = 0\)). Therefore, the density matrix corresponds to the origin \((0, 0, 0)\) in the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this is the origin in the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this would correspond to a pure state outside the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
