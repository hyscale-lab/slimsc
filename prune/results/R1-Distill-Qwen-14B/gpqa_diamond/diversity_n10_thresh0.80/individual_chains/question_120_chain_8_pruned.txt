Okay, so I've got this question about stars' distribution in the sky and how their number per unit parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no—it's the opposite. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer. Because the formula is distance = 1 / parallax (in parsecs, I think).

So the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Oh, maybe uniformly in space, so their number density is the same throughout. So the number of stars isn't decreasing with distance in the sense of volume filling, but considering how parallax works, which depends on distance.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, how many stars are there between plx and plx + dplx, for a given small dplx. And how does that number change with plx.

I remember something about the volume of space and how the number of stars relates to the volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume is proportional to the volume.

But how does the volume relate to parallax. Let's think in terms of spherical shells. For a given distance d, the volume of a thin shell (like between d and d+dd) is 4πd² dd. Because it's the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (dd).

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So substituting d in terms of plx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But since plx = 1/d, then dd is the change in distance, which relates to the change in plx. Wait, let's see: plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign just denotes that as plx increases, d decreases.

But for volume, we're looking at a range in d, which corresponds to a range in plx. So each shell in d has a volume proportional to d² dd, which is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * ( - dplx / plx² ). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, and the volume element in terms of parallax would be a function of plx. Let me think about the differential volume in terms of plx.

So the volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume between d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx. So the volume would be 4π (d + dd)^3 - 4π d^3, but that's a bit messy. Maybe I should think of it as an integral.

Wait, no. Let's think of the change in volume when plx changes by dplx. So, the volume for a thin shell at distance d is 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = ( -1 / plx² ) dplx. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - 1/plx² ) dplx. But wait, the negative just indicates direction, the volume should
