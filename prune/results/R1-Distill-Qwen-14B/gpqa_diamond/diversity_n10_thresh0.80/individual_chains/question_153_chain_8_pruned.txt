Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, the nucleophile adds to the beta position, and the carbonyl gets deprotonated, leading to an enolate intermediate.

Looking at the question, there are three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C, each involving the Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ (A)

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. I think it's a diester, so it's a strong enough base to deprotonate the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be an acrylate with a p-tolyl group attached. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the substituents are methyl ester on C1, p-tolyl on C3.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate is the Michael acceptor here. The enolate of dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, how does the addition go? The dimethyl malonate would first form an enolate. Then, the enolate attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So in this case, the acrylate's beta position is C3. So the nucleophile (from malonate) will add to C3 of the acrylate. The acrylate has a structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, the substituents are different. Let me think: methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(O)OCH3 with the double bond between C1 and C2, and a p-tolyl group on C2. Or maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl substituent on the double bond. Wait, maybe it's more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: so the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the carbon adjacent to the double bond. Hmm, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- so substituting on the middle carbon, so it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C2, making the acrylate (E) configuration.

So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks, which is a strong nucleophile, it will add to the beta position, which is the carbon next to the carbonyl. In this case, the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The carbonyl is at C3 (if I number from the ester group). So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl has the double bond between C2 and C3, and the p-tolyl on C2.

Wait, actually, wait. Maybe I should draw it. For methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)ac
