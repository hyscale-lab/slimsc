Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Hmm, let's think through this.

Wait, the problem says that Ay is equal to c times S. And c is h divided by 4π. Oh right, c = h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix given as the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay = c * S. So first, maybe I should compute what Ay looks like. Let me plug in c. So Ay = (h/4π) * S. So each element of S gets multiplied by h/(4π).

But wait, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh right, eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's compute Ay - aI. Let me write out Ay first. The elements are:

Ay[0][0] = 0 * (h/(4π)) = 0
Ay[0][1] = (-i) * (h/(4π)) = -i h/(4π)
Ay[1][0] = i * (h/(4π)) = i h/(4π)
Ay[1][1] = 0 * (h/(4π)) = 0

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i h/(4π)],
  [i h/(4π), 0] ]

So the matrix Ay is:

0        -i h/(4π)
i h/(4π) 0

Now, to find the eigenvalues, let's set up the equation (Ay - a I) = 0.

So subtracting a from the diagonal elements:

[ -a,          -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π),   -a ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating each part:

First term: (-a)(-a) = a²

Second term: (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²)

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) because i^2 is -1. So (-i)(i) = -i^2 = 1. So that term becomes (h²)/(16 π²) * 1.

So the determinant equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots: a = ± h/(4 π) * (1/(2)) ? Wait, wait. Let's compute the square root.

Wait, h squared over (16 π squared) is [h/(4 π)] squared. Because (h/(4 π))^2 = h²/(16 π²). So a² = [h/(4 π)]². So a is ± h
