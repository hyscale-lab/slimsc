Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I should tackle each part separately: relative speed and total energy.

Starting with the relative speed. Wait, when objects are moving at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract their velocities like in classical mechanics. I remember that the formula for relative velocity in relativity is different. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Or is it (v2 - v1)? Wait, since both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference, but using the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, so let's clarify. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) in the opposite direction? Or wait, no. Wait, in relativity, the velocity of an object as seen from another frame isn't just a simple subtraction. So the relative speed is calculated using the formula for velocity addition.

Wait, correct formula: if object A is moving at v1 =0.6c in the lab frame, and object B is moving at v2=0.5c in the same direction, then the velocity of B as seen from A's frame (u') is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Because in relativity, the relative velocity isn't just subtracted; you have to account for the Lorentz factor.

So plugging in the numbers: (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Numerator: (0.5 -0.6) c = (-0.1c). So the magnitude is 0.1c, but the direction is negative, meaning it's moving in the opposite direction. But the question just asks for the relative speed, which is the magnitude, so 0.1c. Wait, but looking at the options, option B says 0.1c and E=4.96 mc². Option C says 0.14c and higher energy. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, wait. Did I mix up the order? Because when calculating relative speed, the direction matters. Oh wait, because from A's frame, B is moving at 0.5c. But according to the velocity addition formula, the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. So the magnitude is 0.1c. So the relative speed is 0.1c. So that would match option B or perhaps another option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the approach where the relative velocity is calculated in the other direction. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the relative velocity as (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, in that case, (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 -0.3) = 0.1c /0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Oh, that's about 0.14c. So that's different.

Wait, so which is correct? Hmm. Because when you are in frame A, which is moving at 0.6c, and you want to find the speed of B in that frame. So according to the velocity addition formula, u' is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²), where u is the speed of the object in the lab frame, and v is the speed of the frame.

Wait, no, let me get the formula correct. The formula for the velocity of an object in a different frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the object's speed in the lab frame and v is the speed of the frame (here, the astronaut's frame). Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up which is which.

Wait, let me double-check. The standard formula is: if an object has velocity u in the lab frame, and the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to another frame (say, the astronaut's frame S'), then the velocity u' in S' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

In this problem, from the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. So, let's say we want to find B's speed as seen from A's frame. So in the lab frame, B is moving at u=0.5c, and the frame S' (A's frame) is moving at v=0.6c relative to the lab.

Wait no, actually, the lab frame is the rest frame. Or is it? Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify a common rest frame. It says both are moving in the positive x-direction, but their speeds are given as 0.6c and 0.5c. So perhaps we're to assume that they're each moving at those speeds relative to some rest frame (like Earth), and we need to find the relative speed between them.

So in that case, from A's perspective, B's speed is u' = (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/(c²)) ), because A is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab, and B is moving at 0.5c. So vB is 0.5c, vA is 0.6c.

So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) ) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)) ) → (-0.1c)/(1 -0.3) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → approximately -0.1428c.

So the relative speed is 0.1428c, or about 0.14c. Wait, but the negative sign indicates direction; the speed is 0.14c in the opposite direction relative to A.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Now looking back at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D says 0.14c and E=5 mc².

So the relative speed part would match options C and D. I'll have to compute the total energy and see which option that corresponds to.

Now, the total energy of the system. In relativity, the total energy is the sum of the energies of both astronauts. Each astronaut's total energy is gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A, E_A = gamma_A * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc². 

Wait, looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. So that must be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me just make sure I did the calculations correctly. Let me recompute gamma for each.

For A: v=0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. Correct.

E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc². Right.

For B: v=0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding them gives 5.964 mc², so approximately 5.96 mc². So option C matches.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (first astronaut) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass: \(2m\)
- Velocity: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass: \(3m\)
- Velocity: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\), and the total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
