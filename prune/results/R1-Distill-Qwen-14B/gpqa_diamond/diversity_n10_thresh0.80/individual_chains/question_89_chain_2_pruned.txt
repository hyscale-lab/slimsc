Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. First, it's heated with excess KOH, then the product is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, and finally, ozone is bubbled through the solution followed by dimethylsulfide. I need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum.

Let me break down each step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons. So elimination would form an alkene. The product here is a light yellow solid, which suggests it's an alkene, perhaps. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that's usually a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Hmm. But wait, KOH is a base; maybe it's an E2 elimination to form an alkene. Oh, wait, but if it's elimination, the product would be an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction? Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group and a base. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl? Oh wait, wait. No, that's more like a Hofmann or Saytzeff elimination when you have adjacent leaving groups. Wait, in some cases, when you have dihalides, especially geminal dihalides, elimination can form a carbonyl. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—does that have adjacent bromines? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So the 1 and 3 positions would be adjacent? Or perhaps not. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact structure. Let me recall: adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected in a way similar to diamond. So positions 1 and 3 might be on adjacent carbons. If so, when KOH is heated, perhaps elimination occurs, removing H and Br from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond. Wait, but then the product would be an alkene. But the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more like a ketone or ester. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else. If KOH is in excess and heated, perhaps it's a substitution. But substitution in a dihalide would produce what? If it's a SN2 reaction on each Br, but that's unlikely because adamantane is a rigid structure, and SN2 would require a good leaving group and a good backside attack. But KOH is a strong base, so it's more likely elimination. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the initial product is an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxidation doesn't fit with KOH. Wait, maybe it's a formation of a diol? Wait, if KOH is a base but maybe under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Wait, the IR spectrum shows 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How could that happen? If two adjacent Br atoms are replaced by an O-K+ group, but that doesn't lead to a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is an elimination followed by some further reaction. Wait, another thought: Maybe the initial reaction is the formation of a diketone. Oh wait, wait. When a geminal dihalide (two halogens on the same carbon) undergoes dehydrohalogenation with strong base, it can eliminate to form a carbonyl group. For example, if you have R-Br2, heating with KOH could lead to R-O-K+ and eliminate HBr, but wait, that's substitution. But if it's vicinal dihalide, elimination would give an alkene. But the presence of a carbonyl in IR suggests that maybe the initial product is an alkyne? No, because alkyne C≡C stretch is higher, around 2100 cm^-1. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure more carefully. 1,3-dibromoadamantane: the '1' and '3' positions are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane lattice. So, when KOH is heated with it, perhaps two Br groups are eliminated as HBr, forming a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-diene or a cyclohexene-like structure. Wait, but how would that yield a carbonyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction
