Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound based on IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start breaking this down.

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data. The IR shows peaks at 3400-2500, which is a broad region and might indicate O-H or N-H stretching. But looking at the options, there are acids and alkylbenzenes. So maybe that's an O-H from a carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That fits with a carboxylic acid too because their carbonyls are usually around 1700 cm-1. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The chemical shifts can help identify the functional groups and the structure. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (bs), which is a strong indicator of an aliphatic O-H proton. Wait, but in benzoic acids, the COOH proton usually appears around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. Then, the next peak is at 8.0 ppm, a doublet integrating to 2H. That's probably an aromatic proton next to another proton, maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring. The 7.2 ppm doublet (2H) would be the other aromatic protons across from the first pair. So this suggests a para-substituted benzene, like a mono-substituted ring with substituents in the para positions. But wait, I'm seeing two sets of doublets, which could mean two substituent groups on the benzene ring. Oh wait, no—wait, no, wait. If it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but in this case, maybe one substituent is a COOH group and another is an ethyl group or something else.

Wait, but the NMR has another peak at 2.9 ppm, a multiplet for 1H. That could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, maybe a carbonyl. Then 1.7 ppm, multiplet for 2H—maybe a CH2 group attached to something else. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2. And the 0.9 ppm triplet for 3H—a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and an ethyl group. Wait, but how? Let me visualize. The IR shows a carbonyl, so a carboxylic acid group makes sense. The NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is that O-H. Then, looking at
