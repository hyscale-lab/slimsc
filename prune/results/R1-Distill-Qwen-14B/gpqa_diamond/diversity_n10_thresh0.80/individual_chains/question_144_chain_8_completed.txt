Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay has something to do with their lifetimes and speeds.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, giving different distances in meters.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its speed. Oh right, the formula I remember is mean decay length L = v * τ * c, where τ is the proper lifetime, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.

But wait, particles like mesons are moving at relativistic speeds, so I might need to calculate their velocity using their energy and mass. The production energy E is the total energy of the meson, which includes both rest mass and kinetic energy. So E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma can be calculated from E and m. Oh wait, E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E / (m c²) but since they're both in GeV, the c² factors would cancel out? Or maybe I should think of units carefully.

Alternatively, the relation between energy and mass is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c. Wait, let me write down the equations.

First, compute the momentum. E is the total energy. So:

E² = (p c)² + (m c²)²

Solving for p:

p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c

But since E and m are given in GeV, and c is in m/s, I might need to handle the units properly. Wait, maybe I can compute gamma from E and m.

Gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, but I think E is given in GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c². So perhaps:

Gamma = E / (m c² ) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is 6.6667.

Wait, that makes sense because then gamma is E/(m c²), because E includes the rest mass energy. Because E = gamma m c², so gamma is E/(m c²). Since E and m are both in GeV and GeV/c², respectively, the GeV cancels, and c is accounted for.

So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

Now, gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so we can find beta (v/c) from gamma.

Beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Let me compute that. 1/gamma² is (1/6.6667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root gives sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, that's a high speed, which makes sense for a high-energy meson.

Next, I need to find the lifetime τ of the meson. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which relates to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, actually, the correct formula is Γ = ħ / τ, where Γ is the decay width. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship. Let me think again. The natural line width is given by the uncertainty principle, so Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime is related by Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So yes, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s when considering appropriate conversions. So I need to convert Γ into the same units as ħ.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 joules, and ħ is about 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. So converting to GeV·s:

1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 1 GeV·s = 1e9 eV·s.

So, 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) eV·s = approximately 1.688e-54 eV·s. But wait, maybe it's easier to use the commonly known value of ħc in GeV·fm, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, I know that ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, yes, that's a useful value.

So, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV.

Calculating that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So, τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay length L is v * τ * c. Wait, no, because v is in terms of c, so L = beta * c * tau.

Because v = beta c, so L = beta c tau.

So, substituting the numbers:

Beta is about 0.9887.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.057e-24 s.

So, L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.057e-24 s:

2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = ?

Let me compute 2.966 * 2.057 ≈ 6.112.

Then 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 6.112e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, let me be more precise with calculations.

Wait, 0.9887 * 3 = 2.9661.

Then 2.9661e8 m/s multiplied by 2.057e-24 s:

= 2.9661 * 2.057 * 1e8 * 1e-24.

Calculate 2.9661 * 2.057:

2 * 2 is 4, 0.9661 * 2.057 is about 2.000 (because 0.966 * 2 is around 1.932, and 0.966 * 0.057 is about 0.055, so total around 1.987). So 2.9661 * 2.057 ≈ approximately 6.11.

But let me compute more accurately:

2.057 * 2.9661.

Compute 2 * 2.9661 = 5.9322.

0.057 * 2.9661 = approx 0.1685.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.1685 = 6.1007.

So 6.1007e(8-24) = 6.1007e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are around 4e-15 to 5e-16. Hmm, but my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 meters, which isn't matching the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau?

Wait, let's double-check the steps.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma²))) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) ) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (6.666...)^2 )) ).

6.666... squared is 44.444... So, 1/44.444 is approx 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approx 0.9887. Correct.

So L = beta * c * tau.

Compute 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Calculate 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.057e-24 s: 2.9661e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.057) * 1e(8-24) = (6.1007) * 1e-16 = 6.1007e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The options are:

A)5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, all the options are either about 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16 or 5e-16. My calculation is about 6e-16, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units when calculating Gamma. Let me check another approach.

Wait, perhaps the width Γ is related to the lifetime via Γ = ħ / (τ c), but I'm not sure. Or maybe the formula for the decay length is different.

Wait, let me think again about the decay length. The mean lifetime τ is the proper lifetime; when the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, no, because the lifetime is the proper time, so the moving frame observes a longer lifetime. So the decay length would be L = v * (gamma tau) * c.

Wait, wait, perhaps I forgot to consider the time dilation. So the lifetime observed is gamma times tau.

Wait, no, the proper lifetime is tau. The lifetime measured in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the mean path length is velocity multiplied by the lab frame lifetime multiplied by c? No, wait, velocity is in units of c, so L = v * (gamma tau) * c.

Wait, if v is in terms of c (like v = beta c), then L = beta c * gamma tau.

Wait, but tau is the proper lifetime, so L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula. Because the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma tau, and the velocity is beta c.

So, L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake by not including the gamma factor in the calculation.

So let me recalculate using L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, beta is 0.9887, gamma is 6.6667, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.057e-24 s.

So beta gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ approximately 6.6.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately. 6.6667 * 0.9887.

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.66.

Total approx 6.5922.

So L = 6.5922 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Wait, 6.5922 *3e8 = 1.97766e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.057e-24 s:

1.97766e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.97766 * 2.057) * 1e(9-24) = approx 4.068e-15 meters.

Wait, 1.97766 * 2.057 is approximately 4.068.

So 4.068e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

So that's very close to option B.

Wait, that makes sense. So the mistake I made earlier was not including the gamma factor in the decay length calculation. Because the mean decay length is L = beta gamma c tau.

So the correct formula includes both beta and gamma, because the lifetime observed is longer by gamma, and the velocity is a factor of beta c.

So, let me recompute with that in mind.

Tau is 2.057e-24 s.

Beta gamma is about 6.592.

So, L = beta gamma c tau = 6.592 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Compute 6.592 * 3e8 = 1.9776e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.057e-24 s: 1.9776e9 *2.057e-24 = 1.9776 *2.057 = approx 4.065e-15 m.

Which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, that must be the correct answer. So the mistake was initially forgetting to include the gamma in the decay length formula.

So the correct calculation uses L = beta gamma c tau.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate gamma = E / (m c²) =8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

2. Calculate beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈0.9887.

3. Compute tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) =2.056875e-24 s.

4. Compute L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Which gives approximately 4.0655e-15 m. Hence, the answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Here, \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Since the units of \( E \) and \( m c^2 \) are consistent, we calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Here, \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.057 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.592
\]

Then, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.057 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.171 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.592 \cdot 6.171 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **option B**.
