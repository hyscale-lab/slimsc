Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

I remember that the Pauli matrices are usually denoted by σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and σ_y looks similar to this S matrix. Wait, let me recall: σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], yes that's right. So S is the Pauli y-matrix, σ_y.

The operator A is often the spin operator, and for a spin-½ particle like a muon, the spin matrices are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The intrinsic angular momentum operator components are given by A_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, A_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, etc. But wait, in this problem, A_y is given as c·S, which would make c equal to (ħ/2) if that's the case. Let me check the constants.

The problem states c = h/(4π). Hmm, I know that ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. Oh, so c is ħ/2. Therefore, A_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. That makes sense because the spin matrices are (ħ/2) times Pauli matrices. So A_y is (ħ/2) times the σ_y matrix.

Now, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation: det(A_y - a I) = 0.

Let me calculate A_y first. With c = h/(4π) = ħ/2, A_y is:

A_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix becomes:

A_y = [ [0, (-i)(ħ/2) ],
         [i(ħ/2), 0 ] ]

So the matrix is:

[ 0, (-i ħ/2) ]
[ i ħ/2, 0 ]

The eigenvalues of A_y are the solutions to:

det(A_y - a I) = 0

Which is:

| -a    (-i ħ/2) |
| (i ħ/2)    -a |

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i ħ/2)(i ħ/2) )

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) (ħ²/4) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i², which is -( -1 ) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (ħ²/4)(1) = 0.

So a² = (ħ²)/4 → a = ± ħ/2

Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π). Wait, no, because ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is (h/(2π)) * 1/2 = h/(4π). So yes, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So that's for a.

Wait, but the options are talking about the eigenvalues of A_y. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, but wait, no, because A_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, and σ_y has eigenvalues ±1. So A_y's eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * (±1), which is ± ħ/2. Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), so ± ħ/2 is ± h/(4π) ?

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me
