Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when a dibromide reacts with a strong base like KOH, especially in a situation where it's heated, it's probably an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure.

When KOH is used in such cases, it usually leads to the formation of an alkene via E2 mechanism. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense because alkenes can have some color, but I think more importantly, the NMR and IR data can help confirm the structure.

The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong indication of a carbonyl group. Wait, but I thought elimination would form an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's not elimination. Wait, another possibility: when two vicinal bromides (adjacent) react with a base, they might undergo a substitution reaction. Wait, but KOH is a base, more likely to eliminate. Wait, but maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne? No, that usually would require a higher temperature or a different setup. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl, like a ketone. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How? Oh, wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, treating with KOH could lead to a nucleophilic substitution, but with two bromines. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening or some other process. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a double elimination, but if two adjacent Br atoms are present, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But then why the IR peak at 1720? Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Oh wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. No, that doesn't make much sense. Wait, another possibility: KOH could deprotonate something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that elimination forms a conjugated diene, which is an alkene, but the IR peak is from something else. Alternatively, maybe the product isn't the result of elimination but substitution. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH—could it be a double substitution, leading to a compound with a carbonyl group. Hmm, perhaps it's a double substitution where both Br are replaced by something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR data for product 1 is given: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, what can these signals represent?

The 4.79 ppm is probably a CH2 group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester, or perhaps a carbonyl. The broad region from 2.41 to 2.23 (10H) might be several CH2 groups or perhaps some sort of ring structure, like the adamantane skeleton. And the 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Because KOH can cause epoxidation of alkenes, but wait, no, because epoxidation usually involves peracids. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, but the IR peak at 1720 isn't consistent with that. Wait, another possibility: the product is a ketone. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH induces elimination, perhaps leading to a carbonyl group. Oh wait, maybe it's a pinacol-type rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement occurs when a 1,2-diol is treated with acid, leading to a carbonyl. But in this case, we're starting with a dibromide and using a base, so perhaps the mechanism is different.

Wait, wait. Another approach: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes elimination twice, forming an allene (a conjugated diene). But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carboxylic acid, but that seems unlikely under basic conditions.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a double dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think: if two adjacent Br atoms are present, elimination could happen twice, forming a triple bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane could form 1,3-dia adamantane with a triple bond. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl either.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the NMR again. 4.79 ppm for 2H—could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether. 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be a set of CH2 groups in a rigid structure, like adamantane. 1.94 (2H) another CH2 group. So perhaps the product is a di-substituted adamantane with an ether group.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is strong. That's a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone. So perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution. Wait, but in substitution, if two Br are present, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH, giving a diol. But that would be under aqueous conditions, but KOH is a base. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mix of elimination and substitution.

Wait another angle: maybe the product is an epoxide. Because epoxide rings have carbonyl-like oxygen and the IR would show a strong peak around 1720. But to form an epoxide from a dibromide, you usually need a peracid, right? Oh, but maybe in this case, the base
