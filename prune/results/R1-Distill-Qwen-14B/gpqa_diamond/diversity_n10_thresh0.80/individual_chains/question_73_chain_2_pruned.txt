Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options give different relative speeds and energies, so I need to calculate both.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics, right? Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Let me plug in the numbers. Here, both are moving in the same direction, so let's say v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c.

So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7. Let's calculate that: 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428... so 0.14c roughly. Wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part done.

Next, the total energy of the system. Since each astronaut is moving, their relativistic energies add up. The total energy E_total is the sum of their individual energies.

The relativistic energy for each is given by gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c². Let me compute that: 1.1547 *3 ≈ 3.464, so E2≈3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². That's approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that seems to fit. Let me check the other options.

Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. Hmm, maybe if I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the gammas.

Wait, for the first astronaut, 0.6c: (0.6)^2=0.36, so 1-0.36=0.64, sqrt(0.64)=0.8, so gamma is 1.25. Correct.

Second astronaut, 0.5c: (0.5)^2=0.25, 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=~0.8660, so
