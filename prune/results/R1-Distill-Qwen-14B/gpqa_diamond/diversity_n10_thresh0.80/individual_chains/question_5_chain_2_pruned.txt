Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. We need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that operators in quantum mechanics can be represented as matrices. Each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the overall operator P is a vector operator, and we can write it as P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the problem says that the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be represented in spherical coordinates with theta (θ) from the z-axis and phi (φ) in the x-y plane, but since it's in x-z, phi is either 0 or π, I think. So the direction is arbitrary in x-z, meaning φ is fixed, maybe 0. So the operator P is along n, so P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) because P_y would be zero if n is in x-z plane. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, which means that the vector n has components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in x-z, φ is 0 or π. So perhaps n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So P would be along this direction, so P = (n · σ) (ħ/2), where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it by constructing the operator along direction n. Since direction is arbitrary in x-z, we can parametrize it as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because phi would be 0.

Wait, but the operator P is given in terms of its components. So the operator along an arbitrary direction would be a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Wait, but since the direction is in x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector is zero, so the operator along n would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute.

So let me write that down. The operator along n is:

P_n = n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z.

Each P_x and P_z is given. Let me write the matrices.

P_x is given as (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]].

P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So P_n would be (n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z) * (ħ/2).

Wait, but n_x and n_z are components of the unit vector along direction n. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, because in x-z plane, the polar angle
