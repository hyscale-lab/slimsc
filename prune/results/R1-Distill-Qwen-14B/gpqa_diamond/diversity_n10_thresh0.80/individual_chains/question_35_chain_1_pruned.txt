Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator, specifically the Y-component of a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum in quantum mechanics is often represented using Pauli matrices or something similar, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Oh wait, that looks familiar. I think the Pauli matrices are similar. Let me recall: the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix, right? So A_y would be (h/(4π)) times the Pauli Y matrix.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to solve the equation A_y |ψ> = a |ψ>, where a is the eigenvalue and |ψ> is the eigenvector.

Wait, but eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices? I remember that for the Pauli matrices (like X, Y, Z), the eigenvalues are ±1. So each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Since A_y is (h/(4π)) times S, which has eigenvalues ±1, the eigenvalues a for A_y would be (h/(4π)) * (±1). So a = ±h/(4π). 

Wait, that's the real part? Because eigenvalues of S are real? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait a second. Wait, no. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, right? So their eigenvalues are real. So S being the Pauli Y matrix is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real, +1 and -1. So when you multiply by a real constant c, the eigenvalues become c*(±1), which are real. So the eigenvalues of A_y are real numbers: ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are purely real. That means any statement suggesting an imaginary part to the eigenvalue is wrong. 

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts are ±h/4
