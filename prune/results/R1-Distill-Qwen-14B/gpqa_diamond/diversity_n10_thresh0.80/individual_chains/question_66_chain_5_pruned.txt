Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

First, I remember that the SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. So what symmetries are we talking about here?

Lorentz symmetry... right, that's the symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. All the fields and their interactions in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because they are part of a relativistic theory. So any operator in the SMEFT should transform correctly under Lorentz transformations, meaning spinors transform as spinors, vectors as vectors, etc. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry—wait, isn't that a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Because Poincare includes both the Lorentz group and the translations in spacetime. Since the SMEFT is a field theory, it inherently includes Poincare symmetry. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. That would mean options 1 and 2 are correct. But wait, is Poincare symmetry automatically satisfied because they're part of a Lorentz-invariant theory?

Wait a second, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Poincare group includes both translations and Lorentz transformations. So if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect Poincare symmetry, right? Because Poincare symmetry includes the symmetry under translations, which is necessary for momentum conservation and the existence of a well-defined energy-momentum four-vector. So operators in the SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 are both correct, right?

But wait, maybe Poincare symmetry is a larger symmetry. Hmm. Let me think. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. And since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, which the operators must already respect—because they're part of a relativistic quantum field theory. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required
