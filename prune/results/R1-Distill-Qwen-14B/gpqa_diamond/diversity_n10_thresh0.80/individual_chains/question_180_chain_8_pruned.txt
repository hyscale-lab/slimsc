Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric potential energy. Let's see what it says.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. The particles are in an isolated system, which probably means we don't have to worry about external fields interfering.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So I imagine point P is where one charge is stuck, and the other twelve are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given in various exponents, so it's probably a very small number, like on the order of 10^-26 or similar.

Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant (about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²). But wait, when you have multiple charges, you have to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up.

Since we have 13 charges, but one is fixed at P and the others are at 2m from P, let's think about how the potential energies add up.

First, the charge at P (let's call it Q) will interact with each of the 12 charges at distance 2m. So each of these 12 contributes a potential energy term with Q.

Additionally, the 12 charges at 2m from P are all at the same distance from Q, but what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Since they are all at the same distance from P, but each pair among them would be separated by some distance. Wait, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but it doesn't specify their positions relative to each other. Hmm, that complicates things. But wait, if all the 12 charges are at 2m from P, but their positions might form a sphere around P. The distance between any two of them would vary, but if they are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, what's the distance between any two? Actually, the minimum distance between any two points on a sphere of radius r is 2r sin(θ/2), but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to calculate each pair's separation. Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy" of the system. Oh, wait, perhaps the way to get the minimum potential energy is the most compact arrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same point or something? No, that can't be because they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that all the 12 charges are at the same point, but that's probably not the case because they are distinct particles.

Wait, but maybe the problem is treating them as if the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are negligible or perhaps we're only considering the potential energy due to the fixed charge at P. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says "the 13
