Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me a Lagrangian term and the mass of the boson X, which is 6 GeV. I'm supposed to find the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian term looks like this: L(y) = -λ_f f f-bar ψ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me parse this correctly. Oh wait, maybe it's written as L = -λ f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but I think the way it's written might have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction where the boson X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, the general form for Yukawa interaction is something like L = g ψ ψ X. So here, the interaction term would mediate the coupling between the boson X and fermions. So the interaction is something like X times ψ ψ̄, meaning that X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair.

So the boson X is of mass 6 GeV. Now, to find its possible decay products, we need to look at the fermions whose mass is less than half of 6 GeV because in pair production, each particle must have energy at least equal to their rest mass energy. So each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6/2 =3 GeV).

Wait, but wait: the decay X → f f̄ is possible only if the sum of the rest masses of the fermion and antifermion is less than or equal to the mass of X. Since each has mass m, the sum is 2m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So we need to list all fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of known fermions. Let's list them:

Electron (e): mass ~0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
Up quark (u): ~0.0035 GeV
Down quark (d): ~0.0047 GeV
Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
Top quark (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV
Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV.

Wait, but wait, I might have some inaccuracies here. Let me double-check the masses:

Electron: about 0.000511 MeV → 0.000511 GeV ≈ 0.0005 GeV.

Muon: about 105.7 MeV → 0.1057 GeV.

Tau: about 1777 MeV → 1.777 GeV.

Up quark: current masses vary, but I think the u is around ~2 MeV, so 0.002 GeV.

Down: ~4-5 MeV → about 0.004-0.005 GeV.

Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV (some sources say 1.27, others 1.5). Let me go with 1.27 GeV.

Strange quark: ~95 MeV → 0.095 GeV.

Bottom quark: about 4.1-4.7 GeV (varies, but around 4.5 GeV typically).

Top quark is way too heavy, so decay to top would require X mass at least twice the top mass, which is way higher than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into t t̄.

So now, let's list which fermions have mass ≤3 GeV. All except the bottom and top.

So possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau-
u ū
d d̄
s s̄
c c̄

Wait, but wait: the charm quark is about 1.27 GeV, so 2 *1.27 = 2.54 GeV < 6 GeV. So yes, c c̄ is allowed.

Similarly, tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78=3.56 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. Wait, wait! Wait, X is 6 GeV, so 2m must be ≤6 GeV. So m ≤3 GeV.

Tau is 1.78 GeV, 2*1.78=3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be produced.

Wait, but wait no: the condition is 2m ≤ M_X, where M_X is 6 GeV. So 2m ≤6 → m ≤3 GeV. Tau is 1.78 GeV ≤3 GeV, so yes.

So the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So possible decay channels are X → e+ e-; mu+ mu-; tau+ tau-; u ū; d d̄; s s̄; c c̄.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? Its mass is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So 2m would be about 9 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b̄.

So the decay options would include all these fermion pairs except for b, t, and any others heavier than 3 GeV.

So looking at the options, let's examine each choice:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b is 4.5 GeV, so this option includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, includes all the allowed fermions, including c, which is allowed.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, t has mass ~173 GeV, which is way too high. So including t t̄ is impossible. So option C is wrong.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b which is too heavy. So incorrect.

So the correct option is B. Because it includes c c̄, which is allowed, and all the lighter fermions, but excludes b and t.

Wait, but wait. The problem is that the interaction term allows X to decay into any of the fermions for which the coupling exists. So the term in the Lagrangian is L = -λ_f f \bar{ψ} (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Wait, perhaps it's L = -λ f \bar{ψ} X ψ. So X couples to all fermion species. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV is allowed.

So in that case, the decay products could include any such fermion.

So the correct decay options are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Looking back at the options:

Option B includes all these except for t and b. So option B has X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That's exactly what we're expecting.

Wait, but why does option D include b b̄? Because perhaps the OP forgot about the mass limit. But no, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so b (4.5 GeV) is too heavy. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term provided suggests that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, and the decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is allowed if the total rest mass of the fermion pair \( 2m_f \) is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq
