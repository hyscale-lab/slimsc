Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has three parts, labeled A, B, and C, each being a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. So, dimethyl malonate is a diethyl or dimethyl ester of malonic acid. Its structure is O=C-CH2-CO-OEt (but as dimethyl, so OMe groups). The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. That structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? Or wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O-OEt)-p-tolyl? Hmm, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O-OEt)-p-tolyl, but I might be getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-CO-OEt. Wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt, so if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, perhaps the substituent is on the third carbon from the ester? Wait, maybe I should think about it as the acrylate being CH2=CHCOOEt, but with a substituent on the third carbon. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(=O-OEt)-p-tolyl. No, that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)COOEt. That makes more sense. So the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt.

Wait, but the question says (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So the substituent is on the third carbon (the one adjacent to the ester). So wait, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CO-OEt, but with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. So CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OEt, but wait, that would be 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate, perhaps. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OEt where the middle CH is replaced by p-tol
