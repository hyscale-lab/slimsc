Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked. So, there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. The planets are in circular orbits, and they were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. 

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think. Wait, no, actually, the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. So the RV technique measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which is tied to the planet's orbital period.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Hmm, okay. So both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. Since the stars are same mass, and planets same mass, the main factors here are the velocity of the star and the distance of the planet from the star, which relates to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

Wait, the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(2/3) )) ) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_*, it's often approximated as K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) ), but wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, I think K is given by (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )
