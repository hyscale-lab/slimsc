Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a meson resonance. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of the meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so I guess it's a very small distance.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. Because the longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. Oh right, the formula for the mean decay length is usually something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), where c is the speed of light.

But how do I find the lifetime? I think the lifetime is related to the decay width. Oh yeah, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but more accurately, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are inversely related. For a particle like this, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the mean lifetime τ is related to the uncertainty in time.

So I think the relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check the formula. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. Yes, that sounds right. Because Γ is the total decay rate, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime when considering the uncertainty principle.

Now, let me plug the numbers in. First, I need to convert all units to be consistent. The width Γ is given in MeV, mass in GeV, so I should convert them to the same unit. Let me convert Γ to GeV because the mass is in GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

But wait, units are tricky here. Because ħ has units of GeV·seconds or something? Let me make sure. I know that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Let me confirm that. Yes, because 1 GeV is about 1.602×10^-10 J, and ħ is 1
