Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given relationship is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/parallax^5. And we need to find how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range.

Hmm, wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax, and the farther away, the smaller the parallax. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance (in some units, maybe parsecs). So if r is the distance, plx ≈ 1/r.

So the problem says N varies as 1/plx^5. So substituting plx as 1/r, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that: 1/(1/r^5) is the same as r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, that's the number of stars as a function of r. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe they're asking about the differential, like dN/dr.

Wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N with respect to r (dN/dr) would be proportional to r^4. Because the derivative of r^5 is 5r^4. But wait, the options don't have 5r^4. Oh, but the options are about how the number changes, so maybe they're considering the scaling without the constant. So the change per unit r would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The number of stars N is proportional to r^5. So if you go from r to r + dr, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to (r+dr)^5 - r^5, which for small dr is approximately 5 r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4. So the density increases as r^4.

Wait, but the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps the question is asking for the density of stars as a function of r. So in that case, it's r^4. Looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but another thought: maybe I should consider the total number of stars up to a certain distance. For example, if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars within a distance r would be proportional to r^5. But the question is about the number per unit distance, so that's the derivative, leading to r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of stars per unit volume, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the question says per unit range of distance, which sounds like a linear measure, not volume. So I think the correct approach is to take the derivative.

So putting it all together: N ∝ 1/plx^5, plx ∝ 1/r → N ∝ r^5. Then dN/dr ∝ r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4, which is option C.


The question involves determining how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} \approx \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we find \( N \propto r^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we get \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is that the number of stars in the region of the sky changes with distance as \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
