Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this kind of thing, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, and there are several clues to figure out what X is.

First, let me read the question again carefully.

Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Wait, but a molecule is made of atoms. Hmm. Let's think: the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons in total. Or maybe each atom in the molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons? Or does the entire molecule have equal numbers? The wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the problem says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So, the total number of neutrons in the molecule equals the total number of protons. But in a molecule, each atom contributes its own protons and neutrons. So, for example, if the gas is H2O, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16), and each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's H-1). So H2O would have 2 H's contributing 2 protons and 0 neutrons, and O contributing 8 pro
