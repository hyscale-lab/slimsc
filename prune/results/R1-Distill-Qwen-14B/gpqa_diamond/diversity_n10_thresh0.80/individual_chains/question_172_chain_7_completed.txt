Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I've studied a bit about stellar atmospheres and the like. Let me try to think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're to find the equation that relates their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, the stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so Boltzmann's equation probably applies here. Right, Boltzmann's distribution describes the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant. Oh wait, let me get that right: n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels 2 and 1.

In this case, the excited state is higher energy, so let's say the excited level is level 2 and the lower is level 1. So for star_1, the population of level 2 is twice that of star_2's level 2.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So n2/n1 for star_1 is 2/(1), perhaps? Wait, perhaps I should think it the other way. The number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So if n2 is the excited level, then n2_1 / n2_2 = 2.

So according to Boltzmann, for each star, n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where T is the star's temperature. But wait, wait. Wait, in Boltzmann, it's n2 = n1 * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So the ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But in star_1, the ratio is n2_1 /n1_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, n2_2 /n1_2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio n2/n1 is 2 for star_1. Or maybe, wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". So maybe the population of a higher energy level is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is n2_1 /n1_1 = 2, and for star_2 it's n2_2 /n1_2 = some value. But I need to relate this to the temperatures T1 and T2.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of (n2 / n1) between the two stars is 2. That is, (n2_1 /n1_1) / (n2_2 /n1_2) )= 2. Because in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2.

Wait, perhaps taking the ratio of the two ratios. So (n2_1/n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2). Because star_1 has twice as many in the excited state as star_2. So:

n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2).

But from Boltzmann, n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for star 1, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2, exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So putting it together:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Hmm, let me write that equation:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, no, because ln(a*b) = ln a + ln b. So:

ln(2) + ln(exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )) )

Which is ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

So:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Let me rearrange this equation.

Bring the term involving T2 to the left and the term with T1 to the right.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2).

Hmm, let's see. Alternatively, we can multiply both sides by -1 to make it a bit cleaner.

ΔE/(k T1) = (ΔE/(k T2)) ) - ln(2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to move all terms to one side.

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substitution gives:

[ΔE/(k)] * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

Wait, but I'm trying to find an equation that relates T1 and T2 without the ΔE and k. Wait, does the equation given in the options have any terms involving ΔE? Let me look at the options.

Wait, the given options don't involve ΔE. So maybe I can rearrange the equation to express it in terms of T1 and T2.

Hmm, but perhaps I should think about another approach. Let me go back.

Another approach: the excitation ratio is given as 2. So (n2_1 / n1_1) = 2 (n2_2 / n1_2).

Wait, no, perhaps I should think that for each star, n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for star_1, n2_1/n1_1 is twice that of star_2's n2_2/n1_2. Wait, no, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, perhaps:

(n2/n1)_1 / (n2/n1)_2 = 2.

So:

[exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = 2.

Which simplifies to exp[ ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) ] = 2.

Taking the natural log of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, same as earlier. So:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2).

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But wait, perhaps I can rearrange this equation to solve for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2.

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

Hmm, but the problem gives the value of ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. But the options don't involve ΔE. So perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should look for an equation that when you plug in the ratio, you get an expression that's similar to the options given.

Let me try to manipulate the equation further.

So, from earlier:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But what's the value of ΔE? 1.38e-23 J. And k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same value.

Wait, that's interesting. So ΔE = k (because 1.38e-23 J is the value given for ΔE, and k is also 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * 1 K.

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE = k * T, where T is 1 K. But that might not be directly helpful.

Wait, so substituting ΔE = k into the equation:

ln(2) = (k)/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = 1 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Hmm, that's one of the options. Let's look.

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Yes, that's option D.

So the correct equation would be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

So, the ratio of the excitation in star 1 to star 2 is 2: (n2_1/n1_1) = 2*(n2_2/n1_2).

Using the Boltzmann factor:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking ratio, then taking natural log gives us:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Rearranging gives:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Which is:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Then, because ΔE = k, it simplifies to ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

So yes, option D is correct.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations of two energy levels in thermal equilibrium is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature of the star.

For star_1, the excitation ratio is \( \frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) \), and for star_2, it is \( \frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \). Since the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, the ratio of the two excitation ratios is:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{2,1}}{n_{1,1}}}{\frac{n_{2,2}}{n_{1,2}}} = 2.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions for the excitation ratios:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = 2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \) (as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
