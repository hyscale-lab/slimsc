Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So this is a two-level system, probably spin-1/2 since we're talking about up and down states.

Then, the question asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds like an anti-diagonal matrix. Let me think: for a 2x2 matrix, if i≠j, so the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements (1,1 and 2,2) are zero. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0 ]

So that's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. What kind of operator is this? Oh, wait, that's the form of the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the operator here is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

But the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the X operator, which are superpositions of |up> and |down> states. Let me recall. The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So when multiplied by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, no, actually, the eigenvalues are (hbar/2)*+1 and (hbar/2)*-1. So the operator's eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's, just scaled by hbar/2.

So the problem is asking for the probabilities of measuring the electron in each of these eigenstates when the state is |alpha>, and also the average value of this operator.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. So let me find the normalization constant.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. Let me calculate the inner product <alpha|alpha> to find the normalization factor.

The inner product is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i), but wait, no. Wait, wait—actually, |alpha> is proportional to that, so to find the normalization, I'll compute the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2−i). So their magnitudes squared are |1+i|^2 and |2−i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
|2−i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.
So the inner product is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so that |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>].

Wait, no. Wait, the state is proportional to that sum, so |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), because the norm is sqrt(7). So we have to divide by sqrt(7) to make it a unit vector.

Now, the operator in question is (hbar/2) sigma_x. So its eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me confirm: yes, because sigma_x |+x> = (hbar/2)|+x>, etc.

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, and then find the coefficients' magnitudes squared.

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

We can write |+x> and |−x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|−x> = (|up> −
