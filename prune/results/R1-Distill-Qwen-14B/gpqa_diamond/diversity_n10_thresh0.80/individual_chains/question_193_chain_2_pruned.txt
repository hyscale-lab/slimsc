Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So, plx is 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs, right?

So, if plx is inversely proportional to distance (r), then plx = 1/r. So, I can substitute that into the given relation. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/( (1/r)^5 ), because plx is 1/r.

Let me compute that. 1 over (1/r)^5 is the same as (r^5). Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so flipping that gives r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. If N ∝ 1/(plx^5), and plx = 1/r, then substituting, N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Because 1 divided by (1/r)^5 is r^5. So yes, N is proportional to r^5.

So, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So it's probably about the density or the number per unit volume. Hmm. Or wait, maybe it's the number of stars per unit distance. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the initial statement says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when parallax increases, the number of stars decreases. Since plx is 1/r, when r increases, plx decreases, so 1/plx^5 increases, meaning N increases. But how does N change as r increases by a certain amount?

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of differential relationships. Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance r with thickness dr. The volume of the shell is 4πr² dr. The number of stars in that shell
