Okay, so I need to figure out what the compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data, and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start by analyzing the spectral data.

First, looking at the IR data: the strong absorption around 3400-2500 cm-1 suggests the presence of either an -OH group or an amine, but more likely an -OH because amines usually have a broader peak. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But wait, 1720 is more typical for an ester or a ketone. However, another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be C=C stretching, which might indicate aromatic rings or conjugated carbonyls. So putting this together, maybe an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group.

Now the NMR data. Let me list the peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, likely an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. Because at around 10-12 ppm, that's typical for carboxylic acids. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, which fits with that.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, probably from an aromatic ring with substituents. The integration (2H each) suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, such as -COOH and something else.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm, perhaps a CH adjacent to an electronegative group. Maybe something like a CH next to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating for two Hs, possibly part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH or a carbonyl.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet with three Hs, so maybe a CH(CH3) group. Like a CH2CH(CH3) or similar.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for three Hs, probably a terminal CH3 group, like at the end of a chain.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring has substituents at the para positions. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (from the IR and NMR data), because the IR shows a carbonyl, and the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm which is a carboxylic OH. The other substituent is a side chain.

Looking at the NMR, the substituents on the benzene ring: the 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm are doublets, so perhaps each is meta to the substituent, but given the integration, it's more likely a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but if it's two substituents, each with two H's as doublets, that might not add up. Wait, maybe one substituent is in one position and another group in another, but perhaps the substituent is more complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mono-substituted benzene with a substituent that has a group which splits the protons into these doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester or a ketone. Wait, but the IR doesn't show a strong peak for O-H in an ester. Wait, no, the IR has a peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester. But the NMR has a broad peak at 10.5, which is more likely a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, the structure is likely something like a benzene ring with a para-substituted carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, maybe a CH that's connected to a CH2 or something. Alternatively, it's a CH group in a chain attached to the benzene. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be next to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is probably a CH2CH2CH2CH3 or similar, but wait, the triplet at 0.9 suggests it's a terminal CH3 attached to a CH2. So maybe the substituent is a butyl group?

Let me try to sketch this out. Benzene ring, with a -COOH group at position 4, and another group at position 1 (but since para, it's at position 4). Wait, para would be opposite, so if the COOH is at position 1, the other substituent would be at position 4? Hmm, perhaps I should imagine the benzene as having substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, no, in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So if the benzene has two substituents, each in the para positions, the ring would be 1,4-disubstituted. For example, substituents at positions 1 and 4, but that would actually be the same as being para to each other if there are only two substituents. Wait no, in a benzene ring, para is across, so two substituents in para positions would be opposite each other, but that would make the ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4, but wait, position 1 and 4 are para. So that makes sense.

So, substituents at 1 and 4 positions. One is -COOH (from the IR and NMR), and the other is some alkyl group.

The substituent at the para position is a group that has a chain leading to the NMR signals.

Looking at the H NMR: the substituent group attached to the ring has protons at 2.9 (m), 1.7 (m), 1.4 (d), 0.9 (t).

Hmm, let's see. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which suggests it's a CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait,
