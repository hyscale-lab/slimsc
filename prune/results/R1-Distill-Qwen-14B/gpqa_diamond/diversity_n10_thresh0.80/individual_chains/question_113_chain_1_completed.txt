Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectral data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, looking at the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm-1 probably indicates an -OH group, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, but wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad peak because of the O-H stretch. Also, the two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1 are interesting. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak might be from an aromatic ring (maybe conjugated double bonds like in a carbonyl or an amide?), or possibly an ester or another type of carbonyl.

Wait, but the 1700 and 1650 could be something else. Maybe one is a carbonyl. Let's think: if the 1700 is a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester, and 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a substituted benzene. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound must have some sort of double bond, probably either from an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, wait, wait. But aromatic rings in NMR typically show as multiplets in the 7 ppm region, but if the question says there are vinyl hydrogens, maybe it's an isolated double bond, not necessarily aromatic.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Well, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COOH (since 12+1+12+16+16=45? Wait, wait, CH3COOH is C2H4O2, which would be 60 g/mol. Oh wait, no, wait. 45 is more like the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45? No, formaldehyde is 30. Wait, 45 is also the molecular ion for something like CH2(OH)CH3 (but that's 59?), no. Wait, maybe it's a fragment. Like the tropylium ion (C7H7+ is about 91), but that's not 45. Alternatively, the fragment could be from an acetic acid group? Wait, the molecular weight of acetic acid is 60, but perhaps a fragment like CH3CO+ would be 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16 = 43), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a ketene group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the methyl group attached to an oxygen. Wait, methyl ester? Or maybe a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a cleavage. For example, if the compound has an ester group, it might cleave into two parts. Suppose the ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion breaks into a smaller part.

Wait, the options given are all six carbons, so the molecular formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. So the molecular weights would be:

C6H12O: 6*12 +12 +16 = 72 +12 +16=100.

C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

C6H12O2: 72 +12 +32=116.

So the molecular weights are 100, 98, 114, 116.

If the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45, that's 45. So 45 is about 1/2 of 98 (49 each), but not exactly. Wait, 45 is close to half of 90, but the molecular weights here are 98, 100, 114, 116. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a functional group.

Wait, considering the IR data. Let me think again. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 is probably an O-H group. The two peaks at 1700 and 1650 might indicate two different carbonyl groups, but that's less common. Alternatively, one might be a carbonyl and the other from conjugated double bonds.

Wait, what if the compound has an ester group and a double bond? For example, an ester would show a peak around 1700, and the 1650 could be from an adjacent double bond, perhaps an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Another thought: the 1700 might be a ketone and the 1650 a conjugated carbonyl. Or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. But then, if the compound has an aromatic ring, it's probably a benzene ring with substituents. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which could be from a double bond adjacent to oxygen, like in an ester or an epoxide, but not necessarily.

Wait, but if the FTIR shows broad peak at 3000, that's probably an O-H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is very broad, and the carbonyl is around 1700. Alternatively, an ester would have a carbonyl at around 1740 (but can vary). Wait, but in the IR here, it's 1700 and 1650. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Or maybe a ketone and an ester?

Alternatively, could the 1700 and 1650 be an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the possible formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight 116.

B) C6H10O: 98.

C) C6H10O2: 114.

D) C6H12O: 100.

The mass spec has a fragment at 45, which is exactly half of 90 (if I'm considering something like CH3COO- but that's 60, wait...). Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45. So, diethyl ether is 45+ something? No, wait, diethyl ether is C4H10O, which is 74. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from a cleavage of a larger molecule. For example, if the compound is an ester, the ester group could fragment. The ester group (O-CO-O) typically breaks into an acid and an alcohol fragment. So, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', the cleavage could yield R-O- and R'-CO-OH. So the R-O- part could be a smaller fragment. For instance, if R is CH3O-, then the fragment would be 45 (CH3-O is 32, but that's not matching 45. Hmm, wait, CH3COO- would be 60, but that's not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion? Or another type.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, another thought: the IR peaks. The 1700 is a carbonyl, say, an ester or a ketone. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. But then the broad peak at 3000 would suggest an O-H group, perhaps in an alcohol or a phenol.

But wait, if it's a phenol, the O-H would be broader and stronger. So, phenol would have a peak around 3000, maybe a bit broader. But then, the IR of phenol would have strong absorption around 1600 for the aromatic ring. Hmm, but the 1650 is a bit higher.

Wait, another possibility: the 1650 could be an amide (but again, no N in options). Or maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have a lower wavenumber for the C=C due to conjugation.

Wait, considering all this, perhaps the compound has an ester group and a double bond adjacent to it. So like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650.

And the O-H stretch at 3000 is from an alcohol or another O-H group. Wait, but if it's an ester, perhaps the compound also has an alcohol group elsewhere? Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but that would have a very strong and broad O-H.

Wait, but wait, the options have O or O2. So, if the O is from an ester and an alcohol, that's two O's. Or if it's a carboxylic acid (two O's). Or maybe a ketone and an alcohol (but that would be O2 as well).

Hmm. Let me think about the NMR. There are vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So something like a diene or an alkene. If the compound has an ester and a double bond, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have the structure R-O-CO-CH2-CH2-X or something like that. No, wait, alpha,beta-unsaturated esters have the structure RCO-O-R’ with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. Like CH2=CHCOOR.

So in that case, the IR would show 1700 for the ester carbonyl and 1650 for the conjugated double bond. The O-H at 3000 would have to come from another group, perhaps an alcohol. So the overall structure would be something like CH2=CHCOO-R-OH, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe a diol with an ester group, but that seems less likely.

Wait, but if the molecular formula has two O's, like option A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2), then the O's could be from an ester and an alcohol group.

Now, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so the double bond is present. If the molecule is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the vinyl hydrogens would be on the double bond next to the carbonyl.

Putting that together, the formula would have to include the ester group (O2) and the double bond. So, perhaps the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), which has a degree of unsaturation of (2*6 +2 - H - X +N )/2. Wait, the formula is C6H10O2. So, the degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees: one from the ester (a carbonyl counts as a double bond) and perhaps a ring or another double bond. Alternatively, one from the ester and one from a double bond. So that fits for the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Alternatively, if the formula is C6H12O2 (option A), the degree of unsaturation is (14 -12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So perhaps a ring plus a double bond? Or a double bond and an ester.

Wait, but FTIR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the compound has an ester and a conjugated double bond, that would account for both peaks.

So the O-H is from something else, like an alcohol group. So the formula must have two oxygen atoms, so either option A or C.

Now, looking back at the mass spectrum: fragment at 45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight is 114. So, 114 is the molecular ion. If a fragment is 45, that's about a third of the molecule. Maybe it's a cleavage product.

Alternatively, for a molecule with an ester group, perhaps a fragment like CH3COO- could come off, but that's 60. Hmm, but 45 is smaller. Wait, perhaps it's a ketene fragment. Or maybe the molecule breaks at the ester oxygen.

Wait, another approach: maybe the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which would have a molecular weight of 114. If a fragment is 45, perhaps that's a CH3O- group (which is 32) plus another 13? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketone. Like, if the compound has a ketone group, maybe a cleavage could produce a smaller ketone as a fragment.

Alternatively, if the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, perhaps the ring opens, releasing a smaller fragment. For example, if it's a five-membered ring, opening might release a molecule with a lower m/z.

But I'm not entirely sure how to link the m/z 45 fragment to the molecular formula. Let me think about the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 116. If it breaks into a fragment of 45, then the rest would be 71. But 45 is a third, which might not be a typical cleavage product.

Option C: C6H10O2. 114. If it breaks into 45, the rest would be 69. Hmm, that's plausible.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of a larger group. For example, losing a larger substituent and leaving a smaller fragment.

Wait, another thought: if it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the structure might be something like CH2=CHCOOR. The R could be a substituent. If R is a methyl group, for example, then the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2-, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the mass spec fragment is from the loss of the R-O- group. So, for example, if the ester is R-O-CO-CH2-CH2-X, then the R-O- could break off, leaving the CO-CH2-CH2-X part. But I'm not sure how that would get to 45.

Wait, another angle: Let's consider the molecular formula and possible structures. For example, if the formula is C6H10O2, perhaps it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, like methyl vinyl benzoate or something like that. Or maybe it's an ester and an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but that would require more O's.

Wait, but the options don't include more than two O's.

Another approach: Let's look at the possible structures for each formula and see which fits the spectral data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So either a ring and two double bonds, but wait, wait, the formula is C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond plus a ring. Hmm, but if there's a vinyl group (double bond), then that's one, so maybe a ring as well.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So two double bonds or two rings or one of each.

So for option C, it could have a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Wait, but the IR has 1700 and 1650. So possibly two double bonds, like a conjugated ester and a double bond.

Alternatively, the 1700 is the ester carbonyl, and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond. So that would fit with option C (two degrees of unsaturation: one from the ester, one from the double bond).

So, putting the data together:

FTIR: O-H (broad around 3000), ester carbonyl (1700), conjugated double bond (1650).

1H NMR: has vinyl hydrogens, so double bond present.

Mass spec: fragment at 45.

So, the formula is likely C6H10O2 (option C), which would have two oxygen atoms (from ester and maybe an alcohol or another group).

But wait, the O's: if it's an ester, that's O2. But the O-H suggests another O, but wait, no. Because in an ester, you have R-O-CO-O-R'. So that's two O's from the ester (the O in the R-O and the O in the COO). So, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, that's two O's. So the O-H must come from elsewhere. Wait, but that would require three O's. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, now I'm confused. Because an ester has two O's, and if there's an O-H group (like an alcohol), that's a third O. But the options don't have any with three O's. So that suggests that the O-H is part of the same O in the ester? No, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, which would have two O's (the COOH group). So, in that case, the formula would have two O's, and the O-H is part of the carboxylic acid group. So, the FTIR's broad O-H would be from a carboxylic acid, the 1700 from the carbonyl, and the 1650 from something else.

Wait, but wait, a carboxylic acid would have a peak around 1700 for the carbonyl, and a broad O-H around 3000. Then the 1650 peak would need to be from another functional group. Maybe a conjugated double bond.

So, if the compound is a substituted carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond, that would fit the IR data. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the double bond is present. The O's would be two from the carboxylic acid group.

So the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C) because it has two O's. Let's see, the molecular formula for a substituted benzoic acid with a double bond would have the formula C6H10O2.

Wait, let's see: benzene ring with COOH and a double bond. Benzene is C6H6. If you have a COOH group, that adds (COOH is -C(=O)OH, which is one C and two O's, and adds two H's (since replacing a CH with COOH). So, benzene (C6H6) plus COOH (would be C7H6O2, but wait, we're only at C6... Hmm, maybe it's not benzene. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOH, but that's only three carbons. Hmm, maybe a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexene carboxylic acid. So, cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding a carboxylic acid group (COOH) would make it C7H10O2. But the options are only C6, so perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a di-substituted carboxylic acid, like CH2CH2COOH with another substituent. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't a carboxylic acid, but another group with an O-H.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a phenol group. Then, the phenol O-H would be broad around 3000, and the 1700 and 1650 could be from an ester and a conjugated double bond. But then, the O's would be:

Phenol O-H is one O, the ester is two O's, but that would make three O's, which isn't present in any of the options. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. What is the molecular formula that could give a fragment of 45? 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think of possible fragments.

45 = 3*16 + 3*1 (but that's 45, so maybe CH3COOH is 60, which is too high. Alternatively, 45 is CH3CH2O (45? 12*2 + 6 + 16 = 36 +16=52? No, that's not right. Wait, 45 is 12*1 +1*3 +16*1 + 16*1? No, that's 12+3+32=47. Maybe 45 is (CH3)2O, which is 45. So, (CH3)2O is 45. So, if the fragment is (CH3)2O+, which is 45.

So, if the compound has a (CH3)2O group, then the fragment would be 45. So, the molecular formula would have two CH3 groups attached to an O. So, for example, a diethyl ether group or something else.

Wait, let me think of the molecular formula in the options. For example, option C is C6H10O2. If the molecule has a (CH3)2O group, that's three carbons, three O's? Wait, (CH3)2O has two O's? No, wait, (CH3)2O is dimethyl ether, which is O with two CH3 groups. So formula is C2H6O. So, if the unknown compound has a dimethyl ether group, then that would contribute C2H6O. But the molecular formula is C6, so the rest would be C4H4O. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an acetal, which would have two (CH3)2O groups. But that would add four carbons and two O's.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester with a dimethyl acetal group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of a larger substituent. For instance, maybe the molecule is an ester with a substituent that can break off, leaving a (CH3)2O fragment.

Wait, but I'm not getting much from this. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. So molecular weight 114. If a fragment is 45, that leaves 69. 69 isn't a familiar fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the (CH3)2O group, which is 45. So the rest of the molecule would be C3H4O.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the cleavage of an ester. Esters typically break into an acid and an alcohol. So for an ester R-O-CO-R', the cleavage would produce R-O- and R'-COOH. So, for example, if R is CH3, then R-O- would be CH3-O (which is 32), but that's not 45.

Wait, maybe the cleavage is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta cleavage. For example, if the ester is adjacent to a double bond, the beta cleavage might produce a carbonyl fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from a rearrangement, like a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in mass spectrometry for ketones with gamma hydrogens. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's see what each option's possible structures could be and what their mass spectra would look like.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester with a ring or a double bond and a ring. For example, methyl cyclopentene carbonate or something else. Not sure. The molecular ion is 116. If it breaks into 45 and 71, but I don't know what 71 is. 71 is the molecular weight of C3H7O or something. Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's think of a structure with an ester and a double bond. Maybe something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester, like a lactone with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which has the formula C4H6O2. But our compound is C6H10O2. So perhaps a longer chain. So, maybe something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's too long.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's 4 carbons from the ester group and 2 from the double bond, making 6 in total. Wait, CH2=CHCOO is three carbons, and the ester R is CH2CH2CH2CH3 (four carbons), but that's seven in total. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's more than six. Hmm, I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with an ester and a double bond. But that would require more carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester, but that would require more O's, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is methyl vinyl benzoate, but that's C9H10O2, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted acrylic acid ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something else. Let me think of the molecular formula C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation are 2. So, perhaps a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If it's a ring and a double bond, perhaps cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, cyclohexene ester. But how?

Alternatively, think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 is probably a key to the structure. If the fragment is (CH3)2O, which is 45, then that's two methyl groups attached to an oxygen. So, the parent compound must have a (CH3)2O group as a substituent.

So, an example would be a diethyl ether substituent, but that's more than two methyl groups. Alternatively, a compound like (CH3)2OCH2CH2COOH. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a methyl propenoate. Wait, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which is C4H6O2. But the formula is C6H10O2, so perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, another thought: the mass spec fragment at 45 could be a ketene ion. A ketene is O=C=O and has a molecular weight of 44. Wait, but 45 is close. Alternatively, maybe a different fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the compound is an ester of a larger acid, say, CH2=CHCOO-R, and R is a larger group. When it breaks, R could leave, and the remaining part could be 45. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a result of a McLafferty rearrangement. McLafferty rearrangement occurs in ketones with gamma hydrogens, producing a fragment with a double bond and a loss of an ethylene fragment. So, for example, if the molecule has a ketone and a gamma hydrogen, the rearrangement would produce a fragment that's 45. Because the McLafferty rearrangement would lose an ethylene (28) and form a new double bond. So, if the parent ion is 73, then 73-28=45. Hmm, that could fit.

So, a molecule with a ketone and a gamma hydrogen could undergo a McLafferty rearrangement, producing a fragment at m/z 45.

So, if the compound has a ketone, that would fit the IR peak at 1700. Then, the 1650 peak could be from a conjugated double bond, perhaps from the McLafferty rearrangement product.

Wait, but the original compound doesn't have the double bond. The rearrangement produces the double bond in the fragment. So, the original compound would have a ketone and a gamma hydrogen. So, the structure would be something like R-CO-R', where R' has a gamma hydrogen.

In that case, the IR would show a strong peak at 1700 (the ketone), and the 1650 could be from the rearrangement fragment, but I'm not sure.

Also, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which would come from the double bond in the rearrangement product. But wait, the NMR is for the original compound, not the fragment. Oh, right, the NMR is of the original compound, so that must have the double bond.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to make a table.

Let me list the options and their possible structures:

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be an ester with a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. Only one O, perhaps an alcohol and a ring or double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two O's, possibly an ester and a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O. One O, maybe an alcohol.

Now, considering the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present in the original molecule. So, options B and D have one O and a double bond. But if the IR has a broad O-H, then the O must be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

If it's a carboxylic acid, but the formula must have two O's (since a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which has two O's in COOH), then the formula must be C6H10O2 (option C). Because the carboxylic acid contributes two O's, and the NMR shows a double bond.

So, the IR would have 1700 (carbonyl), O-H around 3000, and 1650 could be from a conjugated double bond.

The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from the McLafferty rearrangement if the compound is a ketone. Wait, no, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the McLafferty wouldn't apply. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of COOH, leaving a smaller part.

Wait, if the formula is C6H10O2 and it's a carboxylic acid, with a double bond, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. That would be a six-carbon carboxylic acid with a double bond. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2.

In that case, the IR would show O-H (broad at 3000), the carbonyl around 1700, and the double bond around 1650. The NMR would have vinyl hydrogens (the CH2=CH part). The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from the loss of the carboxylic acid group (COOH is 44), but wait, 44 is COO-, but the fragment is 45. Hmm, so 44 plus one more... Maybe the loss of the COOH group would leave a pentyl fragment, but the molecular weight of pentyl is 70, which doesn't match 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the McLafferty rearrangement applies to a ketone. But if the compound is a carboxylic acid, it wouldn't have a ketone.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but considering all the data, the most fitting option seems to be C6H10O2 (option C), because it has two O's (possibly from an ester and a double bond), the IR fits, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, and the mass spec could be from a fragment involving (CH3)2O.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.


To determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we analyze the spectral data provided:

### FTIR Analysis:
- **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, such as a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid.
- **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹**: Could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or a double bond, such as in an α,β-unsaturated ester or a conjugated aromatic system.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond in the molecule.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This suggests a smaller fragment, potentially from a cleavage or rearrangement. A plausible candidate for this fragment is **(CH₃)₂O** (dimethyl ether, molecular weight = 45).

### Options and Analysis:
The possible molecular formulas are:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: Molecular weight = 116, degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or one double bond).
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**: Molecular weight = 98, degrees of unsaturation = 2 (two rings or two double bonds).
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: Molecular weight = 114, degrees of unsaturation = 2 (one ring and one double bond or two double bonds).
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**: Molecular weight = 100, degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or one double bond).

#### Key Observations:
1. The FTIR data suggests the presence of both a carbonyl group and a double bond, which aligns with **C₆H₁₀O₂** (option C), as it has two degrees of unsaturation.
2. The broad O-H peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ could correspond to an alcohol or carboxylic acid group, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak matches a carbonyl group, such as in an ester or carboxylic acid.
3. The ¹H NMR data confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, indicating a double bond, which is consistent with the degrees of unsaturation in **C₆H₁₀O₂**.
4. The mass spectrometry fragment at **m/z = 45** could arise from a cleavage involving a (CH₃)₂O group, which is plausible in a compound with the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry, are most consistent with the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula accounts for the observed functional groups, degrees of unsaturation, and the mass spectrometry fragment.
