Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator gives the eigenvalue when the state is an eigenstate. So, the eigenvalue here is +ħ/2.

The operator P is given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, let's write them out.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[0, 1]
[1, 0]
So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]
That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2.

And Pz is (ħ/2) times:
[1, 0]
[0, -1]
Which is the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, but the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, meaning it's in the form (n_x, 0, n_z). So any direction in the x-z plane can be represented with angles θ and φ where φ is zero or π since it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, phi is the azimuthal angle, so in x-y it would be the angle around the z-axis. But since n is in x-z, perhaps phi is 0 or pi, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the direction can be parameterized with a single angle, say θ, where θ is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis.

Wait, the general form for a direction vector n in the x-z plane would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is the angle from the x-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, the direction vector with polar angle θ would have x component sinθ, z component cosθ, and y component zero. So n points in the x-z plane.

Now, the operator P is along this direction n, so the operator should be P = n_x Px + n_z Pz. Wait, but wait, that's correct because the operator P is the component along the direction n, so it's the sum of the components scaled by the direction vector's components.

Alternatively, wait, I think the operator for the spin along a direction n is given by the dot product of the vector operator P with n. So the operator would be P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But in this case, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y = 0. So the operator simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but given that n is a unit vector, then n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the Y-component of the direction is zero.

So the matrix representation of P would be the sum of (n_x * matrix for Px) + (n_z * matrix for Pz).

Let me compute that.

The matrix for Px is [[0,1],[1,0]], so n_x times that is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]].

The matrix for Pz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so n_z times that is [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z]].

Adding them together: P = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So the matrix for P is:
[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, and each of these n_x and n_z are components of the direction vector n. Since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, where θ is the angle from the x-axis. So substituting, the matrix becomes [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] multiplied by ħ/2, because each component (Px, Pz) was scaled by ħ/2. Wait, wait, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is scaled by ħ/2, right? So when we combine them, the operator P is (n_x (Px) ) + (n_z (Pz)), each of which has the ½ ħ factor.

So the full operator P would be:

P = (n_x (ħ/2) σ_x) + (n_z (ħ/2) σ_z)
= (ħ/2) [n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z]

So the matrix is (ħ/2) times:
[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix elements are:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
              [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So now, the problem is to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, but since the operator is scaled by ħ/2, perhaps the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. Let me see. For the Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1. So for σ_x, the eigenvalues are ±1, same for σ_y and σ_z. So when you scale by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2.

So the problem is to find the eigenvector of P for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me denote the eigenvector as |v> = [ a; b ], where a and b are the components.

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So substituting P's matrix:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [ a; b ] = (ħ/2) [ a; b ]

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the scaling factor:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [ a; b ] = [ a; b ]

So the equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

So these are the two equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Wait, let me write them again:

Equation 1:
cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a → [cosθ -1] a + sinθ b = 0

Equation 2:
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b → sinθ a + [ - cosθ -1 ] b = 0

So we have two equations:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

We can treat this as a homogeneous system, and since the equations are not contradictory, there's a non-trivial solution (the eigenvector).

Let me write the first equation:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Similarly, from the second equation:

sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b → a = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] b

So setting the two expressions for a equal:

[ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ]

Multiply both sides by (cosθ -1) sinθ:

- sin^2 θ = (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1)

The right-hand side is cos^2θ -1. So:

- sin^2θ = cos²θ -1 → But cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ.

Wait, substituting cos²θ as (1 - sin^2θ), so:

Right-hand side: (1 - sin²θ) - 1 = - sin^2θ. So left side is - sin^2θ, which equals right side, so the equality holds. So the two equations are consistent, which makes sense because the matrix is 2x2 and we have non-trivial solutions.

So I can choose either equation to find the ratio a/b.

Let's take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Because I can rearrange it:

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / ( 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] b
= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b = cot(θ/2) b

So the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2), so a = cot(θ/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a; b ] = [ cot(θ/2) b; b ] = b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T.

But we can choose b to be any non-zero scalar, so for simplicity, set b = 1. Then a = cot(θ/2).

Alternatively, to avoid division by zero when θ is 0 or 180 degrees, perhaps better to write it in terms of sine and cosine.

Wait, but let's proceed.

The eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But let's normalize this vector. The components of the eigenvector are a and b. So the norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(θ/2)|^2 + 1 = (cos²(θ/2) / sin²(θ/2)) + 1 = [ cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ] / sin²(θ/2) ) = 1 / sin²(θ/2).

So the normalization factor is sqrt( sin²(θ/2) ) = |sin(θ/2)|. But since θ is between 0 and π (as it's in the x-z plane), sin(θ/2) is positive. So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) , 1 * sin(θ/2) ].

Simplify cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * sin(θ/2) )= cos(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).

Wait, but wait, that's without considering the factors of ħ. Wait, in the problem statement, the eigenvector's elements are the components, perhaps multiplied by some factors involving ħ? Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iϕ} sinθ)
C) (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))
D) (√(2/3) ħ cos(θ/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(θ/2))

Hmm, based on my calculation, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Wait, but that's without any factors of ħ. Because the components a and b are just the amplitudes, which don't carry units of ħ. So the eigenvectors are dimensionless. So the options with ħ would be incorrect.

Looking at the options again, option C is (cosθ/2, sinθ/2). So that's what I have.

Wait, but wait a second. The question asks for the eigenvector of the operator P, but I think I may have made a mistake in the setup. Because P is constructed as a combination of the spin components. Let me double-check.

Wait, the operator P is for the muon's spin, and the eigenvectors are spin-up and spin-down along the direction n. So the eigenvectors are the same as the spin states along that axis.

In the standard spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates for spin-up along a direction (n_x, 0, n_z) are given by:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |+x> + e^{iϕ} sin(θ/2) |+z>? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the conventions. Alternatively, the eigenstate can be written as [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]^T.

Wait, but in our calculation, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so φ is zero. Because the direction lies in the x-z plane, the angle phi (azimuthal) is either 0 or pi. So for phi=0, the state would be [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

But wait, in our problem, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle phi is zero. So the eigenvector should be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, without any complex phase factor. So option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this, but option B has a phase factor, which might not be appropriate here because phi=0.

But wait, let's think again. The problem says that the direction n lies in the x-z plane. So phi is either 0 or pi. So in the eigenvector, the angle phi is zero. So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think about the setup. The operator P is given as the vector operator, but it's along the direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvectors for spin-1/2 systems are |+> = [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]^T.

But in our case, phi=0 because n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So
