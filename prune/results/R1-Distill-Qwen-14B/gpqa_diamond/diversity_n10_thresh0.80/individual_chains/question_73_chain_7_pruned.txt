Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally like you would in classical mechanics. I think you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by something. Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure I get the formula right. The formula for the relative velocity of two objects moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, no, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), but actually, I might be mixing it up. Oh wait, wait, I think it's (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, the formula I remember is for the velocity of an object as observed from another frame. So if object A is moving at u relative to the lab frame, and object B is moving at v relative to the lab, then the speed of A relative to B is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, are both moving in the same direction? Yes, so one astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the other at 0.5c. So the relative speed should be calculated as (0.6c - 0.5c) over (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

So the numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c², which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7, which is approximately 0.14286c, so about 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as
