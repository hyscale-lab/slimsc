Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually written as linear combinations of basis states. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states. So, the state |alpha> is a linear combination of these two.

Wait, the question says it's "proportional" to that combination, so I guess we need to normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients should equal 1.

So first step: normalize |alpha>.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me calculate their magnitudes squared. 

The magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. Similarly, for (2-i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5. 

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), right? So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but for probabilities, I might not need to worry about normalization because the probabilities are found from the squared magnitudes, but since the state isn't normalized here, I should maybe normalize it first before computing probabilities.

Hmm, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The given operator has matrix elements Aij where Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the dimension here? Since the state is in a two-level system (|up> and |down>), the matrix is 2x2.

So the operator's matrix is:
[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Because for i not equal to j, it's hbar/2. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm,
