Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about the number of stars varying with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that parallax and distance are related. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun, right? Oh right, the formula for distance is in parsecs, and it's given by distance = 1 / parallax (plx). So if a star has a parallax plx, then distance r is 1/plx. That makes sense.

Now, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let's write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since r is 1/plx, that means plx is 1/r. So substituting plx with 1/r, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), so the reciprocal is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, wait. But wait, no. Because the number of stars as a function of parallax is given, and we need to relate it to the number as a function of distance. Let me think again. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5 ) = r^5. So yes, N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, wait, maybe I'm missing something here. The number of stars per unit volume? Or per unit distance?

Wait, the question says "number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm, perhaps what they're asking is the density of stars as a function of distance. Or maybe the number per unit volume.

Wait, I think I need to think in terms of volume. If the number of stars in a region depends on distance, how does the count change as you go
