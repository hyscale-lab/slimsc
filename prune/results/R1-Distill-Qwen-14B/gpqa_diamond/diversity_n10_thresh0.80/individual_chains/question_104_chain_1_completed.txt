Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both stars are like our Sun, and their planets are Neptune-sized.

They detected these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method. RV detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to move. The star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The problem gives the periodic shift in wavelength for each planet. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. They're asking how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, but what's the relationship between the spectral shift and the planet's orbital period? I think the RV method measures the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's mass and the size of the orbit.

Oh right, the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me think. Oh yeah, I remember the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the main variables would be the orbital period and the semi-major axis.

Wait, but the RV method gives the velocity of the star, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance (semi-major axis). But the exact formula might be a bit tricky.

Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(1 AU)^(1/3)) )? Wait, maybe not. Let me get the formula right.

The correct formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think about the relationship between K, the velocity, and the orbital period.

I remember that a larger K means the star is moving more, which could be due to a more massive planet, a shorter period, or a larger orbit (since a more distant planet would cause a longer period but perhaps a larger velocity? Hmm, not sure.)

Wait, the velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass and the orbital parameters. The formula is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the same for both stars here. So M_* is the same for both, as both stars are similar to the Sun.

So, K ∝ (M_p) / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is roughly the same for both. Therefore, K should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is smaller, P would be larger, and vice versa.

Wait, let me get that again. If K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then P is proportional to 1/(K^(3)).

Wait, let's see:

Since K ∝ (M_p) / (P^(1/3)), rearranging gives P ∝ (M_p) / K.

But since M_p is the same for both planets, P ∝ 1/K.

But wait, if K is higher, then P is shorter. Because K is the velocity, so higher velocity implies shorter period. For example, a planet close in would make the star move faster.

So for Planet #1, K is 5 milliangstrom. For Planet #2, K is 7. So K2 > K1. Since K is higher, P2 would be shorter than P1. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 compared to P1.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the question is, "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1?"

So P2 = x * P1.

We need to find x.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), then:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = A/(P1^(1/3)), K2 = A/(P2^(1/3)), where A is some constant.

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, because (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3), so (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So that gives P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

But wait, let me think again. Let's write the formula correctly.

We can write K1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (P1)^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = same thing with P2.

Since M_p, M_*, and sin i (assuming both have same i, which is probably the case since they're detected, but maybe not, but the question doesn't specify, so perhaps it's assumed to be same for both), so:

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So K1 / K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can rearrange this:

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, let me double-check.

Wait, K1 = ( ... ) * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

K2 = ( ... ) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

So,

K1 / K2 = (1 / P1^(1/3) ) / (1 / P2^(1/3) ) )

Which is K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2 ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Take both sides to the cube:

(K1/K2 )^3 = P2/P1

So,

P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2 )^3

Wait, but K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is 5/7.

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, but this would make P2 smaller than P1, because (5/7) is less than 1. So P2 is (125/343) times P1, which is approximately 0.364 times.

But the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1. So if P2 is about 0.364 * P1, that would mean that P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. But that would mean that planet #2's period is shorter, so it's not longer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I inverted the ratio. Let me think again.

We have:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So,

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2 )^3

But K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 is 5/7, which is less than 1.

So (5/7)^3 is about 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 is 0.364. So P2 is ~0.364 times P1. So planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. That would make planet #2 have a shorter period than planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, so it's shorter. But the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, the answer would be less than 1, but none of the options are less than 1 except option A and D. Wait, looking at the options:

Options:
A) ~0.36
B) ~1.40
C) ~1.96
D) ~0.85

Wait, so is the answer 0.36 times? But that would mean that P2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long as P1, meaning P2 is about 0.36 of P1's period. So planet #2's period is shorter, so the question's answer would be option A.

But wait the question is asking "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. If K is higher, that means the star is moving more, which could mean a larger velocity. But a higher K would imply a larger velocity, which occurs when the planet is more massive or when the period is shorter. Because for a given mass, a shorter period (smaller P) would make K larger.

Because from the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So for K to be higher, P must be smaller.

So planet #2 has a higher K (7 vs. 5). So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

So when the question asks, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's actually shorter. So the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.364, which is about 0.36 times.

So the answer is option A: ~0.36.

But wait, the options: option A is ~0.36, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it with the formula correctly.

We have K ∝ (M_p) / (P^(1/3) )

Since M_p is same, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

So K1 = 5, K2 =7

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

(5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = 0.364 * P1 → P2 is about 0.36 times P1 → option A.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given their respective spectral line shifts detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. The RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital parameters. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). 

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for Planet #1 and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for Planet #2, the relationship between the periods can be derived as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Rearranging for \( P_2/P_1 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3.
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1, the answer is \( \sim 0.36 \), corresponding to option A.

Answer: A
