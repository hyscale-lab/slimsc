Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm not exactly sure how to approach it, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving medium. So, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question asks for the speed of the light relative to the observer.

First, I remember that in a medium like glass, the speed of light is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is given as 1 here. But wait, how does the movement of the glass affect this speed? Hmm. Because the glass is moving, does that change how the light's speed is perceived in the lab frame?

I think I need to consider the principle of relativity here. Wait, but waitâ€”special relativity, right? Because we're dealing with velocities and possibly adding them. Oh, but wait, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the observer in the lab is in one frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v relative to that frame.

But light is inside the glass, so how does the velocity of the medium affect the observed speed of light? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In Newtonian mechanics, if a medium is moving at velocity v, and an object in it moves at u relative to the medium, then the object's velocity relative to the lab would be u + v. But wait, that's for non-relativistic speeds. But
