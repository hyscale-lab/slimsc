Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states when measured. The operator here is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So first, I think I need to construct the operator P along that direction.

Wait, the problem gives me the components Px, Py, and Pz. Oh right, the operator P is a vector operator, so P = P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat. But wait, no, the direction is arbitrary, so perhaps I should express P in terms of the components along n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x and n_z such that n_x² + n_z² =1.

Wait, actually, any direction in the x-z plane can be represented with an angle θ, maybe θ measured from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but since the direction is arbitrary, maybe φ is zero? Or maybe since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, φ is the angle in the azimuthal direction, so if it's in x-z, then φ=0.

So the operator P along direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since Py's direction is along y, and n is in x-z, Py's component won't be part of this, right? Wait no, because the operator is a vector, so P along n would involve all components, but in the direction n. So the correct expression is P = n·P, where P is the vector operator.

So to write the operator P along direction n, it's n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but what
