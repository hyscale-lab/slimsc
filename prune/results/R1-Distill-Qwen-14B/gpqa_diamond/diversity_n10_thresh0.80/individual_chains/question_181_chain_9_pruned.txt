Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes under a hypothetical scenario. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are still going on. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux1 over flux2.

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun, right? The pp-I branch leads to pp-II, and then pp-III. Oh wait, no, maybe the branches are different steps in the chain. The pp-III branch might involve the fusion of a proton with a carbon-12 nucleus, producing nitrogen-13, then maybe a positron and so on. Or wait, maybe pp-III is the branch where three helium nuclei (alpha particles) combine to form carbon-12. No, wait, that's the triple-alpha process, which happens in later stages of a star's life, not the main sequence Sun. So, back to the proton-proton chain.

In the pp chain, the main reactions are: two protons (H-1) fuse to make deuterium (D), then another proton fuses to make helium-3 (He-3). Now, the pp-I branch is where two He-3 nuclei fuse to make He-4, releasing two protons. The pp-II branch is when a He-3 fuses with a He-4 to make carbon-12 (maybe), but wait, actually, I think the main branch in the pp chain is pp-I, which is the dominant one. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the pp-III branch might be a specific part. Oh right, I think in the pp chain, after He-3 is produced, there's a branching where three He-3 can combine to make He-4 plus two He-2 (which are not stable, so they quickly decay). Alternatively, a He-3 can capture a proton to become He-4 and a posit
