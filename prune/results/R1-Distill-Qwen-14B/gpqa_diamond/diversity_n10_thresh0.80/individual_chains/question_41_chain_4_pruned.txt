Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? Because the glass is moving, this might complicate things.

I think this is a problem involving relative velocity and maybe special relativity. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities linearly. But wait, v is the speed of the glass, and the glass itself is probably moving much slower than c since it's a typical problem setting. But I'm not sure if I can just add them normally or if I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Let me think. So, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So, I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but the direction is the same as the
