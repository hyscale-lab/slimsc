Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. But I'm a bit rusty on the specifics, so I'll have to think this through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers that look like very small distances.

Wait, mean decay distance... I think that has to do with how far the meson travels before it decays. So particles don't live forever; they decay after some time. The mean lifetime is related to how quickly they decay. And the mean distance would be velocity multiplied by the mean lifetime, right?

So, the process probably involves calculating the lifetime first. I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, right? So the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the mean lifetime τ is related as τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, isn't the full width Γ actually the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ? Yeah, so τ = ħ/(Γ). But wait, sometimes I've seen the relation as τ = ħ/(Γ), but I might have to double-check that.

Wait, no, I think the relation is Γ = ħ/τ. Because Γ is the decay rate, which is energy (because units are MeV, which is energy). So if Γ is in energy, then τ would have units of time when multiplied by ħ (which has units of energy*time). So τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that's right.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. So that's correct.

But wait, does that hold when Γ is the
