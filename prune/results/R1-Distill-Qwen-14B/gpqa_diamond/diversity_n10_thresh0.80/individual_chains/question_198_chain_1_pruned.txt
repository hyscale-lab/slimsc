Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, okay. So I think the first thing is to understand what these stability constants mean. Stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+ or something. Let me think: Co^2+ can form complexes with SCN- in a stepwise manner. So the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, which would have a charge of +1 because Co^2+ plus one SCN^- (which is -1) gives +1.

Wait, but wait, the beta values: β1 is 9. Then β2 is 40. I think β2 would be for the second complex, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Because each time you add another SCN-, the charge decreases by one. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-2? No, wait, that would imply the charge is going the other way. Or perhaps the complexes are:

Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1=9)
[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2] (β2=40)
[Co(SCN)_2] + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^− (β3=63)
[Co(SCN)_3]^− + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (β4=16)

So each step adds an SCN- and the charge changes accordingly.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, I think. So we need to find the fraction of Co species that are in this dithiocyanato form.

The problem is asking for the percentage of this particular complex among all cobalt species. So we need to calculate the distribution of Co^2+ across all possible complexes and find the fraction that's in [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

I remember that for such problems, we can use the distribution equations based on the formation constants. The general approach is to write the expressions for each species, using the stability constants, and find the ratio of the concentrations of each species.

The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But wait, the problem states the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So each of the species adds up to that.

But wait, the concentrations of the complexes are determined by the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN- and Co.

The formula for each species can be written in terms of the concentration of Co^2+ and the various SCN- added.

Alternatively, the formation of each complex can be considered as a stepwise process, and the fraction of each complex can be found using the cumulative formation constants.

Wait, the formation constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So the cumulative formation constants (sometimes denoted as K1, K2, K3, K4) would be:

K1 = β1 =
