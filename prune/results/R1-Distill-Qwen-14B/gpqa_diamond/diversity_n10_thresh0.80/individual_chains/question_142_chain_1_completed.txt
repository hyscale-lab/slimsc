Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question asks about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And then there are four options for the position r.

Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. A pure state is a density matrix that's a projection, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and for mixed states, it's a statistical mixture of these projections.

So looking at the given ρ: it's (1/2) times (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh wait, that's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) divided by 2. Both |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors, each corresponding to a basis state. So this is a classical mixture of these two states, each with equal probability 1/2.

I think that in the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit can be visualized as a point on or inside the sphere. For a pure state |0⟩, the Bloch vector is (0,0,1), and for |1⟩, it's (0,0,-1). But wait, wait. I think I might have that backwards. Wait, actually, the Bloch sphere is parameterized such that the state |0⟩ is at (0,0,1) and |1⟩ is at (0,0,-1). But when you have a density matrix that's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities, what does that correspond to?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Bloch vector for a general qubit state is given in terms of the density matrix. For a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector r is calculated using the formula:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in three-dimensional space. So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

So the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute this.

I know that |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Oh wait, wait! So adding |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| gives I, the identity matrix. Therefore, ρ is (I)/2.

So ρ = I/2.

Now, using the formula ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's plug in ρ = I/2.

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ.

Hmm, that implies that r·σ = 0. What does that mean for r?

The matrix r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. So setting this equal to zero implies that all components of r must be zero. Because each Pauli matrix is non-zero in their respective positions, the only way their linear combination can be zero is if each coefficient is zero. So r_x = 0, r_y=0, r_z=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That's the origin in the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because ρ is a completely mixed state. A density matrix of I/2 represents a completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state. Geometrically, that's the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit state, the Bloch vector \(r\) is related to the density matrix \(\rho\) by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector.

For the given \(\rho\), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Substituting \(\rho = I/2\) into the formula \(\rho = (I + r \cdot \sigma)/2\), we get:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting \(I\) gives:

\[
0 = r \cdot \sigma.
\]

This implies that \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\), so the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Examining the options, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this represents the pure state \(|0\rangle\).  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**: Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state \(I/2\).  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Answer: C
