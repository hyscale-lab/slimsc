Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe this star from Earth, its brightness will vary periodically as it rotates—this is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would cause a dip in brightness. The question is, if the star didn't have these spots, what radius (relative to the star) would a hypothetical exoplanet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve?

Hmm. I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to what would be caused by an exoplanet transit.

First, let's clarify what each part contributes. The star's overall brightness is affected by the spots because they are cooler and thus emit less light. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing the observed brightness to dip each time a spot is facing us.

If there were no spots, the star's brightness would remain constant as it rotates. But the presence of spots modulates the brightness. The maximum brightness occurs when no spots are visible (all spots are on the far side), and the minimum when the maximum number of spots are visible (like when the spotted hemisphere is facing us).

Wait, but the question says the situation resembles an exoplanet. So, the star's brightness variation due to the spots looks similar to the dip caused by a planet transiting in front of the star. So, the amplitude of this brightness variation (due to spots) is being compared to the amplitude that would be caused by a planet blocking some of the star's light.

So, the problem is asking: what's the planet's radius relative to the star's radius that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do?

I think I need to compute the fractional change in brightness (the amplitude of the dip) caused by the spots and set that equal to the fractional change caused by the planet, then solve for Rplanet/Rstar.

Let's break this down.

First, calculate the brightness variation due to the spots.

The star's total brightness without spots is L = 4πRstar² σ Teff^4.

But with spots, part of the surface is emitting less. The filling factor (f) is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered with spots. Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

Wait, but one hemisphere is covered. Wait, the question says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Hmm. So, the spots are on one hemisphere, and each spot is cooler.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered by spots. So, the area of the spots is 20% of the area of one hemisphere.

So each hemisphere's area is 2πR². So the total area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, and then goes away. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, and when it's not, we don't. But because the star is a sphere, when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots (on that hemisphere) are either in our view or not, depending on their position.

Wait, maybe I should think of the brightness variation as when the spots are on the near side versus the far side.

Wait, but the star is rotating such that the spotted hemisphere is either facing us or not. So when the spotted hemisphere is on the near side, we see the spots, otherwise, we don't. So the variation in brightness would be maximum when the spots are on the far side (so our view is of unspotted surface) and minimum when the spots are on the near side (so
