Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I've heard that SMEFT operators must be Lorentz invariant because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant. Effective theories should maintain the same symmetries as the underlying theory they're based on. So Lorentz symmetry is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh right, since the SM respects Poincare symmetry, SMEFT should as well, right? But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes higher-dimension operators, so do these operators have to respect Poincare? I think so because otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense in the same spacetime framework. So Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are both required.

Then, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM isn't CP symmetric because of certain processes like kaon mixing. Wait, but do SMEFT operators have to preserve CP? Or can they violate it? I think SMEFT allows for operators that violate CP because the SM already does. So operators can have terms that break CP. So maybe SMEFT doesn't need to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 isn't a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories respecting the basic principles (like Lorentz invariance) must respect CPT symmetry. Because it's a fundamental symmetry, especially because of the spin-statistics theorem. So SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, must respect CPT.

So putting it together: all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetry, and CPT (4) symmetry. CP (3) is not necessarily respected, as the SMEFT can include operators that violate it.

Looking at the options, which include 1,2,4. Option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be option C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), the symmetries that must be respected by
