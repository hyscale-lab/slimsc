Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both orbits are circular, which is good because eccentricity can complicate things.

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. Wait, but same radius. Hmm, so if the star is more massive but same size, maybe it's a main-sequence star versus a slightly evolved one. Since Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, perhaps it's a subgiant or something, but same radius. Interesting.

The question is about the transit probability. So which planet has a higher chance of transiting? Because the researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size, and the inclination of the orbit. Oh wait, the RV method tells us the planet's mass and period, but not the inclination. But for transit probability, the main factor is the orbital distance compared to the star's radius.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximately R_star / a. Or wait, actually, the formula is (R_star / a) times some function of the orbital inclination. But since the RV method doesn't tell us the inclination, we have to assume a random distribution, so the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by something. Maybe it's (R_star)/(a) multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is edge-on enough for a transit.

Wait, more accurately, the probability that a planet will transit is given by the ratio (R_*) / a, where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, multiplied by the probability that the inclination is such that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight. But because we don't know the
