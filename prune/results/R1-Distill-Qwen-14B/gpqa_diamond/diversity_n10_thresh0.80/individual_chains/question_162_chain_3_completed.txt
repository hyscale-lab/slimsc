Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm not super confident about this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the metric given defines the geometry of the space. The metric here is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). That looks a bit like a 2D metric because the differentials are dx and dy, so this is probably a two-dimensional spacetime or just a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's like a hyperbolic space, right? So the metric might be representing a hyperbolic plane or something similar.

The area of a sphere is usually 4πr², but that's for a regular sphere in Euclidean space. For a pseudosphere, which is hyperbolic, the area would be different. Hyperbolic geometry has different properties, like the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180 degrees, and areas can be infinite for certain shapes.

Wait, the options include 4π(x²+ y²) and others, but option D is infinity. So maybe in this case, the area is infinite. But why?

Let me think about the metric again. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric blows up. That suggests that the radius of curvature is related to 2, since 4 is 2 squared. So maybe when the radius r is 2, something happens at the boundary.

Wait, the question specifies a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So I think the area of a pseudosphere in hyperbolic geometry is actually infinite. Because as you go further from the center, the area keeps increasing without bound. Unlike a regular sphere where the area is finite, in hyperbolic space, the area is unbounded for a given radius. So the area would be infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but why does the metric given here relate to that? Let's see. The metric is conformally flat, meaning it's like a scaled Euclidean metric. The scaling factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element would be the determinant of the metric's coefficient times dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients. So the area element dA is sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy. Since g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - x² - y²), their product is (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2. So the square root of that would be 32 / (4 - x² - y²).

But wait, the actual area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant. Since the metric is diagonal, g = (32/(4-x²-y²))². So sqrt(g) is 32/(4 -x² - y²). So integrating that over all x and y where the denominator is positive (so x² + y² <4) would give the area.

But wait, when you integrate 32/(4 - r²) over r from 0 to 2, in polar coordinates. Let me compute that. So in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and the area element is sqrt(g) r dr dθ. Wait, no, because we have to include the Jacobian determinant, which is r. So the area would be the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The metric is given as ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²))(dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², so this becomes ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So the area element is sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) r dr dθ, because in polar coordinates, the area element is r dr dθ. Or wait, no: for a metric in polar coordinates, the area element is sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ, multiplied by the Jacobian determinant if needed.

Wait, maybe I should remember that the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor in polar coordinates would have components g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), g_θθ = (32 r²)/(4 - r²), and the off-diagonal terms are zero because it's diagonal.

So the determinant g is g_rr * g_θθ = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32)^2 r² / (4 - r²)^2.

So the square root of g is 32 r / (4 - r^2). So the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ, which is [32 r/(4 - r^2)] dr dθ.

Wait, but I'm integrating this over the region where r² <4, so r goes from 0 to 2. So the area is the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π:

Area = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Simplify this. The integral over θ is just 2π. So Area = 2π * ∫ (32 r/(4 - r²)) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr. Let me set u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r. So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r / u ] * ( - du/(2r) ) ) = ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) ) = -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is -16 ln |u| + C. Now, substituting back, u=4 -r². So the integral from r=0 to 2:

Evaluated from 0 to 2: [ -16 ln(4 - (2)^2) ] - [ -16 ln(4 -0) ] = [ -16 ln(0) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ]

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So -16 * (-inf) is positive infinity. So the integral diverges to infinity. So the area is 2π * ∞ = ∞.

So that means the area is infinite. So the correct answer is D) +infty.


The metric provided is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space with a denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \). This suggests that the space has a boundary at \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \), which corresponds to a radius of 2. The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \).

A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere is unbounded as the radius increases. For \( r = 2 \), the metric becomes singular at the boundary \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \), indicating that the space extends infinitely close to this boundary. To compute the area, we use the area element derived from the metric. In polar coordinates, the metric becomes 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element is then 

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \( g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, \( g = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2} \), so \( \sqrt{g} = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \). The area is given by 

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) gives \( 2\pi \), leaving 

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral simplifies to 

\[
A = -16 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to 

\[
A = -16 \left[\ln|u|\right]_4^0 = -16 \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

Since \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.
