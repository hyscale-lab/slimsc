Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh right, stochiometric means it's in a 1:1 ratio, right? So each unit of the complex has one Ca²+ ion. The question is about the free calcium ion concentration.

Wait, the given K value is 5x10^10. I think that's the formation constant, Kf, for the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation constant tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so less free metal ions in solution.

So the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

But wait, the problem is about the calcium ion concentration. So I think we're assuming that the EDTA is in excess, so that the concentration of free EDTA is approximately equal to the initial concentration of EDTA minus the amount that complexes with calcium. But wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that EDTA is present in excess, then the free EDTA might be approximately equal to its initial concentration. But wait, no, because the problem says the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So maybe the total concentration of EDTA is much higher, but that's not given. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the formation constant equation. Let's let [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. What about [EDTA^4-]? Well, considering that the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca²+. But wait, if the EDTA is in excess, then the free EDTA might be approximately equal to the initial concentration. But wait, the problem doesn't give the initial concentration of EDTA, only the concentration of the complex. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The solution contains 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA. So, let's write the equilibrium:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ Ca-EDTA

The formation constant Kf is equal to [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But we need to find [Ca²+]. So we have [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M.

But wait, I'm not given the concentration of EDTA. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, no, perhaps the solution is in a situation where the EDTA is in excess, so that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the initial concentration of EDTA, which isn't given. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the solution is such that the EDTA is in excess, so that [EDTA^4-] ≈ initial concentration of EDTA, which is much higher than the amount that complexes with Ca²+. But without knowing the initial EDTA concentration, I can't proceed that way. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, maybe the problem is considering that the EDTA is fully deprotonated, and that the solution is at a pH where EDTA is in its Y^4- form. So, perhaps the concentration of EDTA^4- is equal to the total EDTA concentration in solution. But without knowing the total EDTA, that's tricky.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- is so high that [Ca²+] is negligible compared to the total EDTA. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex, but that doesn't make sense because the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA.

Wait, perhaps I should treat this as a simple case. Let's assume that the concentration of free EDTA is equal to some value, but without knowing it, that might not be possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something obvious here.

Wait, another thought. Since Kf is very large (5e10), that means that the complex is very stable. So almost all the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA, and the free [Ca²+] is very low.

So, let's let [Ca²+] = x. Then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02.

The formation constant equation is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But I don't know [EDTA^4-]. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the total EDTA in solution includes the free EDTA and the complex. Let me denote [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [Ca-EDTA].

But without knowing [EDTA_total], I can't directly compute [EDTA^4-].

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that EDTA is present in such excess that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the initial concentration, which is much larger than the amount that complexes with Ca²+. So, in that case, [EDTA^4-] ≈ EDTA_initial ≈ [Ca-EDTA], but that's not correct because [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. That would imply [EDTA_initial] is much higher, but without knowing it, perhaps I should proceed differently.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the complex and the free Ca²+ and EDTA. Wait, let me think: if the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, and assuming that all EDTA is in the form of Y^4- (since pH is ideal), then the total EDTA concentration is [Y^4-] + [CaY^2-] = [Y] + [CaY] = [Y] + 0.02.

But without knowing [Y], I can't calculate this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is making a simplifying assumption. Let me think. Since Kf is so large, 5e10, the reaction tends to go to completion. So almost all of the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA. So the free [Ca²+] would be very low.

Wait, but how do I proceed without knowing [EDTA]?

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the EDTA is in such excess that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration, which is considered much higher than the amount that complexes with Ca²+. So, for example, if the EDTA concentration is much larger than 0.02 M, then [EDTA^4-] ≈ [EDTA_total] ≈ much larger than 0.02. So in that case, [EDTA^4-] ≈ [EDTA_total], and [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M.

So, the equation becomes Kf = (0.02) / (x * [EDTA_total]) ≈ 5e10.

But without knowing [EDTA_total], this doesn't help. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex. But that's not logical because EDTA can form multiple complexes, but in this case, it's with Ca²+.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem differently. Let's think in terms of the dissociation of the complex.

The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = y.

But the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaY^2-] = 0.02.

So, Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * y).

So, x * y = 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

But I have two variables, x and y. I need another equation.

Ah, perhaps the total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaY^2-] = y + 0.02.

But without knowing the total EDTA, I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps if EDTA is in excess, then y is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration, which is much larger than 0.02. But then, 0.02 would be negligible compared to y, so y ≈ [EDTA_total].

But without knowing [EDTA_total], I can't compute x.

Hmm, maybe the problem assumes that the EDTA concentration is equal to the concentration of the complex. But that doesn't make sense because then [EDTA_total] = 0.02, which would mean y = 0.02 - 0.02 = 0, which can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex? No, that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that the concentration of free EDTA is much higher than that, so [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the initial concentration of EDTA, which is much larger. So, let's assume that [EDTA^4-] >> [CaY^2-], so [EDTA^4-] ≈ [EDTA_total].

But without knowing [EDTA_total], this approach doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the solution is such that the concentration of free EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex. Hmm, but that's not a standard assumption. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of EDTA^4- is equal to the concentration of the complex, but that doesn't make much sense either.

Wait, maybe the problem is just using the formation constant expression, assuming that [EDTA^4-] is the same as the concentration of the complex. No, that doesn't fit the equation. Let's try plugging in.

If [EDTA^4-] = 0.02 M, then:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * 0.02)

So, 5e10 = 0.02/(0.02 x) => 5e10 = 1/x => x = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11 M.

But looking at the options, that's not present. The closest option is C) 6.3e-7 M. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

If Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

We have [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M.

Let me rearrange the equation:

[Ca²+] = [CaY^2-] / (Kf [Y^4-]).

But without knowing [Y^4-], I can't find [Ca²+].

Unless I make an assumption that [Y^4-] is equal to [CaY^2-], which would be 0.02 M. But wait, that's a big assumption.

So plugging in [Y^4-] = 0.02 M:

[Ca²+] = 0.02 / (5e10 * 0.02) )= 0.02/(1e12) ) = 2e-12 M.

Which is 2e-12, which isn't one of the options either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem assumes that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that all of the Ca²+ is in the complex. Then, [Ca²+] would be zero, but that's not possible. Also, that doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is implying that the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex, and that the total concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of the complex. But that would mean that [Y^4-] is zero, which is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the assumption that [Y^4-] is equal to [Ca²+], but that's not a standard assumption. Let's try that. So [Y^4-] = x.

Then, Kf = 0.02/(x^2) =5e10.

So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me calculate sqrt(4e-13). 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5 (since (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13). So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, because 10^(-6.5) is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches.

Wait, but why did I assume [Y^4-] = x? Because if [Y^4-] = x, then [Ca²+] =x, perhaps? Because then, the [Y^4-] is equal to [Ca²+], which may not be a valid assumption. Hmm.

Wait, this approach led me to option C. Let me see if that makes sense.

So the assumption is that [Y^4-] = [Ca²+] =x.

Then, Kf = 0.02/(x^2) =5e10 → x^2= 0.02/(5e10) =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

So the [Ca²+] would be approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

### Given:
- \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \)
- \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \)

### Assumptions:
1. The problem assumes that the concentration of free calcium ions (\([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\)) is the same as the concentration of free EDTA (\([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\)), i.e., \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). This simplifies the equation.
2. Substituting \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\) into the formation constant equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

3. Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

4. Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Conclusion:
The concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to **Option C**.
