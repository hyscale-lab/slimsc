Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let's read through the question carefully.

So, we have two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet. The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the star's movement due to the planet's gravity. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, because the star's wobble is more pronounced.

Wait, but in this case, both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so the difference in spectral shifts must be due to their orbital parameters. The formula I think relates the velocity semi-amplitude (which causes the spectral shifts) to the orbital period.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But I also remember that K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance. The exact formula might be K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) )^(1/ (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should think about the simplified version. Since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's (both are sun-like stars and Neptune is much smaller), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, which simplifies things.

So the formula simplifies. The RV amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 AU)^(1/3) * (1 year)^( -1 )) ) * something... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) a³, where a is the semi-major axis. Since the orbits are circular, a is the radius.

But how does this tie into the RV method? Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 year) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe it's better to write the formula for K. The formula I recall is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c) ) ]^(-1/3) * [ (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ] * ( 1 / (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(1/3) ) )

But since M_planet is much less than M_star, the (1 + ...) term is approximately 1, so we can ignore it. So K ≈ (G * P )^(-1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / M_star^(2/3) * (2π c)^(-1) )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look for a simpler relation.

Alternatively, K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ) * something. Wait, perhaps the formula can be rearranged to relate K and the period P.

I think another approach is to use the mass function. The mass function for the RV method is f(M) = (M_planet³ sin³i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)² ) = (K³ P² ) / (2π G ) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, the denominator becomes M_star². So f(M) ≈ (M_planet³ sin³i ) / M_star² = (K
