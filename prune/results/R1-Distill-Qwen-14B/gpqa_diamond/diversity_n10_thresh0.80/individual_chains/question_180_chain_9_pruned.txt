Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see... The question is about the electric potential energy of a system of charges. Hmm. So, the setup is: 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, right, electric potential energy in a system of point charges. I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, but for multiple charges, I think you have to calculate the potential energy between each pair and sum them up. But wait, since the system is isolated, maybe there's something else to consider.

So, each charge is 2e. Let me think about the charges. The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2e, and the fixed one is also 2e. So the fixed charge is at P, and the others are each 2 meters away from P.

Wait, but when calculating the potential energy, the potential energy due to a charge in an electric field created by other charges applies. So, for each of the 12 charges, their potential energy is due to the fixed charge at P, right? Because the 12 charges are at 2 meters, so the fixed
