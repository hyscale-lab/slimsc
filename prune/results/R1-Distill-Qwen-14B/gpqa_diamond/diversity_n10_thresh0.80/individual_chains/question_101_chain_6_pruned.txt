Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down. The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and another compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what A and the catalyst B are from the given options.

Hmm, the reaction is acid-catalyzed, so the catalyst B is probably an acid. The options are TsOH (which is p-toluenesulfonic acid, a strong acid catalyst) or acetic acid. So catalysts in the options are either TsOH or acetic acid.

Now, compound A. Looking at the product, it's 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The structure would have a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine. The cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexene ring (so a six-membered ring with a double bond), but in this case, it's attached via a methylene group. Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl would mean a methylene group (CH2) attached to a cyclohexene ring. So the substituent is -(CH2)-cyclohexene.

Wait, no, correction: the name is cyclohexylidenemethyl. So that's a cyclohexene ring with a methylene group attached. So it's a cyclohexene group as a substituent on the pyrrolidine.

So the pyrrolidine has a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexene ring connected via a methylene group. So the product is formed by some kind of addition or ring formation.

What reaction would form such a product? Well, considering that the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a secondary amine. The product has a cyclohexene ring attached. So maybe an enamine formation? Or perhaps a Friedl√§nder or some kind of condensation.

Wait, but 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic secondary amine. If it's reacting with a carbonyl compound under acid catalysis, perhaps forming an enamine? Enamines are typically formed from amines and ketones or aldehydes in two steps: first forming a imine, then eliminating water to form the enamine.

But wait, the product here
