Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says we have a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's eight carbons, nine hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 3) plus a double bond and a ring or another double bond, maybe. Or other combinations. But I'm thinking a benzene ring is likely here because the NMR data has aromatic peaks.

Looking at the NMR data: the peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let me try to interpret these.

The 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. 

The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating for 2H. These look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 is probably para-substituted because the doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring H. Wait, but in para substitution, each H has two neighbors, but maybe they're part of a coupling pattern in a di-substituted benzene? Or perhaps they're from a coupling with another group.

Wait, another thought: if the aromatic region has two doublets each of 2H, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring. Let me think: for a para-substituted ring, if each of the two Hs on the ortho positions (relative to substituent) are equivalent, they might give a doublet, but wait, in para substitution, the ortho Hs are actually two protons that are equivalent, so maybe each would split into a doublet due to coupling with the other. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Wait, but a 1,4-disubstituted benzene would have two sets of protons, each as a pair. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group on the substituent, the ortho and para positions might deshield. Wait, perhaps each of these doublets is for Hs that are adjacent to substituents.

Alternatively, looking at the 6.27 (bs, 2H), broad singlet. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like an OH group or some sort of coupling. Wait, but it's 2H, so maybe two equivalent protons that are adjacent to something else. Or perhaps it's a vinyl group, but vinyl Hs are usually around 5-6 ppm, so 6.27 is a bit high. Maybe adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, eight carbons. Let's think about possible structures. The aldehyde is a possible functional group, as indicated by the 9.72 ppm peak. So maybe the compound is a substituted aldehyde with a benzene ring attached.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm, that's a triplet or a doublet integrating for 2H. That might be a CH2 group next to an oxygen or a carbonyl. Like maybe an OCH2 group, or a CH2 attached to something else. Wait, since it's a doublet, perhaps it's next to another CH2 group. Or, wait, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, as in an ether or an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Because the aldehyde is at 9.72, and perhaps there's a conjugated double bond. Let me think: if there's an aldehyde and a conjugated enol, that could split the aldehyde proton into a triplet, but wait, the aldehyde here is a triplet. How?

Wait, the 9.72 is a triplet, which suggests two neighboring Hs. So maybe the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, which would split into a triplet. So perhaps the structure has an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group. Maybe something like R-CH2-CHO. No, wait, that would place the aldehyde at the end. Or perhaps it's part of a larger structure.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure. Let's say there's a benzene ring attached to a CH2 group. And then a conjugated double bond followed by an aldehyde. For example, phenyl-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that might not fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's an allyl group attached to the benzene, leading to an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the reaction steps. The problem says that the compound is reacted with the given reagents. Let me read the steps:

1. NaNO2 + HCl â†’ This is a typical nitrous acid formation, used in diazotization, but that usually happens with amines. Since our compound has an N, perhaps it's a benzylamine derivative or an aromatic amine. Wait, but the structure has NO in the formula, so perhaps
