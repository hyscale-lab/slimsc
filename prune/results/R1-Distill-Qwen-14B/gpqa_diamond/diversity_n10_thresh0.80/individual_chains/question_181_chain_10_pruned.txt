Okay, I need to figure out the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. Let me think about what I know about the Sun's energy production and neutrino emission.

So, the Sun's core is mainly where fusion happens. The pp chain, which stands for proton-proton, is the main source of energy. There are different branches in the pp chain. I remember that the pp-I branch is the dominant one, and the pp-II and pp-III are less significant. Oh wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping, so that's what I need to focus on.

The pp-III branch produces neutrinos, right? I think the neutrinos produced in the pp chain are electron neutrinos. But wait, the question says that flavor changes don't matter here, so I don't have to worry about them oscillating into other flavors or anything like that.

So, the pp-III branch must contribute to the solar neutrino flux. If this branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that process would cease. But there are other sources of neutrinos, like the CNO cycle. Or wait, do I remember correctly? The CNO cycle produces more carbon-12 and the like, but I'm not sure how much neutrinos it emits. Or maybe I'm mixing up the details.

Wait, the pp chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch is the most important, producing helium-4 from two protons, with a positron and a neutrino emitted. The other branches, like pp-II and pp-III, are minor. So if pp-III stops, the main pp-I probably continues as before.

But how does this affect neutrino production? The pp-I branch emits neutrinos. So if pp-III was producing a certain amount of neutrinos, stopping it would reduce the total flux. But the question is about the ratio between two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Hmm, so what do I know about the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos? I remember that the neutrinos from the pp chain have lower energies compared to those from other processes like the CNO cycle. Wait, but the Sun's energy is mainly from the pp chain, so most of the neutrinos
