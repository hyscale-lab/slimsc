Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the decay of a boson, specifically X, which has a mass of 6 GeV. The question is asking which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

First, let me recall what kinematically allowed means. It means that the decay is possible based on conservation laws and the masses involved. For a boson decaying into fermions, the key factor is whether the mass of the boson is at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because fermions come in pairs (like particle and antiparticle), the minimum energy required is twice the mass of each.

Wait, the interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(v + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, so the interaction term is X ψ_f ψ_f. That probably means that X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So X can decay into any fermion and its antiparticle.

But what fermions are available? Well, the fermions include quarks, leptons, etc. But the masses of these fermions will determine which decays are possible.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's think about the masses of various fermions:

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV, negligible compared to 6 GeV. So 2m_u is about 4 MeV, much less than 6 GeV. So decay to uū is allowed.
- Down quark (d): similar, maybe a bit heavier but still way under. 2m_d ≈ 4 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): around 100 MeV. 2m_s is about 200 MeV. Still much less than 6 GeV. So s s̄ is allowed.
- Charm quark (c): mass around 1.5 GeV. 2m_c is about 3 GeV. Since 3 GeV <6 GeV, decay to c c̄ is allowed.
- Bottom quark (b): mass about 4.5 GeV. 2m_b is 9 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄, because the sum of their masses is 9 GeV, which is higher than X's 6 GeV. So that decay is not allowed.

What about leptons? Electrons are super light, 2m_e is negligible. So e+ e- is allowed.
Muons: around 0.1 GeV each, so 2m_mu ≈ 0.2 GeV, way under 6 GeV. So mu+ mu- is allowed.
Tau leptons: mass about 1.78 GeV. Wait, 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV. That's less than 6 GeV. So tau+ tau- would be allowed.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Are there any other factors, like whether the fermion is charged or not? Or the coupling types?

In the Lagrangian, the term is X ψ_f ψ_f. So X couples to a fermion and its antifermion. So any fermion with a mass less than 3 GeV (since X is 6 GeV, so 6 GeV must be >= 2m_f).

Wait, but for fermions, the mass is a factor. So for a decay X → f f̄, the condition is m_X ≥ 2m_f.

So let's list the fermion masses:

- e, mu, tau: for leptons, the tau is the heaviest. 2m_tau ~ 3.56 GeV. So 6 GeV is more than that, so allowed.
- Quarks: u, d, s, c are all below 3 GeV each, so 2m is less than 6 GeV. But b is 4.5 GeV each, so 2m_b =9 GeV which is more than X's mass. So b is out.

So possible decay products are:

- uū, dđ, s ś, c c̄, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b, s, u, d, tau, e. But wait, b is forbidden because 2m_b>6 GeV. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So c is allowed, since 2m_c=3 GeV<6 GeV. So that's allowed. So option B includes c, which is correct, but does it include all permissible?

Wait, option B says c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d
