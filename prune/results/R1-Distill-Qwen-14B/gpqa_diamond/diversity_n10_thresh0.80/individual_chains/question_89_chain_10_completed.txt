Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, they typically undergo elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation, forming alkenes. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. So if there's two bromines on adjacent carbons (1,3 positions), maybe the reaction would form an alkene between those positions.

The product 1 has a 1H NMR spectrum with specific peaks. Let's break down the NMR data:

- 4.79 ppm (2H): This seems like a triplet. Maybe these are adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an alcohol. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so elimination would form a double bond. Oh, but wait, sometimes elimination can lead to epoxides if there's a peracid involved, but KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination. Hmm, maybe the product is an epoxide? But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Oh, wait, perhaps elimination isn't the only thing happening. Maybe some kind of substitution is also taking place?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH... Oh, wait, another possibility is that each Br is on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH could cause a double elimination, leading to the formation of a diene? Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a cyclohexene-like ring in the adamantane structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening, but I'm not too sure about that.

Wait, the NMR data: 4.79 (2H) could be two hydrogens next to an oxygen, like an ether. But if it's a ketone, the peak would be different, perhaps around 2.1 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol? Wait, when dibromides are treated with aqueous KOH, they can form vicinal diols. Oh! Because if the two Br are on adjacent carbons, the base could cause a substitution reaction, but wait, KOH is more for elimination. Wait, but if it's a vicinal dihalide, heating with KOH could produce an epoxide, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol.

Wait, another thought. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Maybe upon treatment with KOH, it undergoes elimination twice to form a conjugated diene. So product 1 would be a diene, but the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. KOH is a strong base, but maybe in this case, it's a SN2 substitution. But in adamantane, the structure is so rigid that each carbon is highly substituted, making SN2 unlikely. So more probably, elimination.

Wait, let me think about the product 1. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone? How would that form from a dibromide?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the two Br groups are on the same carbon. Oh, wait, no, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which suggests they're on different carbons. So maybe each Br is on a different carbon, and upon reaction with KOH, each Br is replaced by an -OH group. So the product would be a diol, 1,3-diol. But then what would the NMR look like?

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Diol protons are usually around 1-2 ppm, I think. So that doesn't quite fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Epoxide rings would have protons around 3-4 ppm, but maybe deshielded if the ring is strained. Wait, adamantane is already a very rigid structure, so an epoxide would be quite strained, causing the protons to be more deshielded, perhaps around 4 ppm. So that 4.79 ppm, maybe two protons adjacent to an oxygen in an epoxide?

But wait, how would an epoxide form from a dibromide? Epoxides are typically formed from vicinal dihalides using a base like NaOH in an elimination reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a peroxide that forms, but that doesn't fit the KOH condition.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So what reaction of a dibromide would produce a carbonyl? Maybe oxidation? But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe elimination followed by some process.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but that doesn't directly form a carbonyl. Unless it's an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but for that, you might need a peracid or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that when the two Br groups are eliminated, they form a double bond, but maybe the structure leads to a carbonyl. Wait, no, elimination of Br would form a double bond, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. KOH is added. The product is a light yellow solid, suggesting perhaps an epoxide or a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. How? If each Br is replaced by an O group. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement. But pinacol rearrangement involves elimination of water and formation of a carbonyl, but that's for diols.

Wait, unless the dibromide is converted to a diol first, and then under certain conditions, it undergoes a rearrangement. But the reaction conditions here are KOH and heat. So maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination.

Wait, pinacol rearrangement requires a diol and acid conditions. Hmm. Alternatively, the diol could eliminate to form a carbonyl if it's a vicinal diol. Wait, but the product here is 1,3-dibromide, so the diol would be 1,3-diol. The pinacol rearrangement is for 1,2-diols.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR data again. The product 1 has an NMR with 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 2.4-2.2 region is typical for CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyl groups, perhaps as in a ketone. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group elsewhere. The 4.79 (2H) could be adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or alcohol.

Wait, another approach: maybe the product is an epoxide. Let's say the two Brs are on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH could cause elimination to form an epoxide. Wait, but I thought epoxide formation usually involves vicinal dihalides and a base. So the reaction would form an epoxide. So product 1 would be an epoxide.

The NMR of an epoxide would typically show two sets of protons, each as a triplet, because each H is adjacent to the other. But in the given data, the 4.79 ppm is a triplet for 2H. That might fit. But then, what about the IR? The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. Hmm, that doesn't fit an epoxide. Epoxides don't have carbonyls. So maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. How? Maybe via oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Wait, unless it's a peroxide involved, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a di-elimination, leading to a conjugated diene. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? No, that wouldn't have a carbonyl either.

Wait, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement. Suppose the dibromide is converted into a diol first. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH to form 1,3-diol. But 1,3-diol wouldn't directly undergo pinacol rearrangement because that requires a 1,2-diol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different rearrangement.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to think of the IR. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, likely a ketone. So product 1 is probably a ketone.

How does a ketone form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, maybe it's a double elimination. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, and the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, unless it's an elimination followed by some kind of oxidation. But KOH isn't oxidizing. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically applies to amines, not bromides.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would happen with KOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination where each Br is removed, and oxygen bridges are formed. Wait, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. How? If each Br is replaced by a ketone group, but that would require each Br to be on a CH2 group, which upon elimination would form a CO group. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but that usually involves coupling of aryl halides, which doesn't fit here.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the step after product 1. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, our product 1 has a carbonyl (from IR). So if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 might be an enol ether or some kind of enol.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an acetal or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but looking at the next step: product 2 is ozonolysed. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. So product 2 is an alkene.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene, perhaps product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form an enol, which would have a double bond.

Wait, so product 1 is a ketone (from the IR), and when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(isoprop)3, it forms an enol. Enols have double bonds between the carbonyl and adjacent carbon.

So product 2 would be an enol with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Then, product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically cleaves it into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is an enol (with a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl), ozonolysis would break that double bond, possibly forming two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis is usually followed by workup. In this case, after ozonolysis and addition of dimethylsulfide (which is a reductive workup), the ozonide would break into two carbonyl groups. But depending on the structure, it could form different products.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3. And specifically, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, not counting those that exchange.

So, let's think. If product 2 has a double bond, say between carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (like an enol), then ozonolysis would break that double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, for example, suppose product 2 is a cyclohexenone. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two ketones or aldehydes, depending on substitution.

But since dimethylsulfide is a reductive workup, it might lead to the formation of aldehydes instead of ketones or other products.

But the exact structure might depend on the initial steps.

Let me try to outline the reactions:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR shows carbonyl)
   - Probably, product 1 is a diol? Or a ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's a pinacol-like elimination. If product 1 is a diol, then upon treatment with a strong base, it could undergo elimination to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone formed via some elimination.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, each Br is eliminated, but in a way that forms two ketones. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a trans-elimination, forming a double bond, but I don't see how that leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product 1 is a diepoxide. But earlier I thought that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a mesityl oxide derivative. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about another approach: the NMR of product 1.

The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be two protons next to an oxygen, perhaps in an ether. The 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) suggests a lot of CH2 groups adjacent to something de-shielding, maybe carbonyl groups. 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has a structure where two Brs are on adjacent carbons. Upon treatment with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming a diol. But then product 1 would be a 1,3-diol. But NMR for diol? The OH protons would be broad, but in the given NMR, there are no peaks around 1-2 ppm, which might suggest that the diol protons are exchanged and not observed, or perhaps they are in a more deshielded region.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. 4.79 (2H) could be an AB system for two protons, perhaps in an epoxide. Then, the 2.4-2.23 (10H) could be CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyls. Wait, but where would a carbonyl come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol with a ketone. That doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a geminal diol, but that would have both OHs on the same carbon. But 1,3-dibromide would not form a geminal diol upon substitution.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? Suppose each Br is on a different carbon, and each undergoes an elimination to form a carbonyl group. But how? Maybe each Br is part of a vicinal dihalide, and elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, but elimination usually forms a double bond, not a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene, but then something else happens. Wait, but that would require another reaction step.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a coupling reaction. Wait, but I can't think of a coupling reaction here.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the Schlenk-Olbert elimination, but I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a neighboring group participation. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, which could explain the IR. So, each Br is removed, and each adjacent C becomes a carbonyl. But how?

Wait, wait, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two CH2Br groups. Upon treatment with KOH, each CH2Br could lose HBr and form a carbonyl. Wait, but two CH2Br groups would need to lose two HBr each to form two CO groups. That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe each CH2Br group loses one HBr to form a CH, but that would form an alkene. But how does an alkene lead to a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a CHBr group, and upon elimination, each forms a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should move on to the next steps to see if that helps.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. Since product 1 is a ketone (from the IR), and Al(iPr)3 is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's involved in some kind of enolization. Enol ethers can form from ketones under Lewis acid catalysis, but I'm not entirely sure.

If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 would be an enol ether. Enol ethers have an oxygen adjacent to a double bond, so they have a structure like R-O-C=C-R'. When ozonolysis is applied to an enol ether, it would cleave the double bond. But ozonolysis of an enol ether might not proceed straightforwardly because enol ethers are more stable.

Wait, but ozonolysis is typically used on alkenes. So if product 2 has an alkene, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether with a double bond. So when ozonolysis is done, the double bond is cleaved, and the oxygen from the enol ether would affect the product.

But I'm not entirely clear on how that would proceed. Ozonolysis of an enol ether might form two carbonyl groups, but perhaps with an oxygen still attached.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has an isolated double bond, such as in a dienone structure, and ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But regardless, the key point is the NMR of product 3. The coupling pattern of the most deshielded H, not counting those that exchange.

Assuming that product 3 has carbonyl groups, perhaps from ozonolysis, but in any case, the most deshielded H would likely be near a carbonyl group.

Wait, the most deshielded H is likely to be on a carbon adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So perhaps it's part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

But the coupling pattern depends on neighboring Hs. If the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, perhaps it's a triplet if the adjacent H is coupled to two Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets if it's coupled to two different sets of Hs.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone. Each ketone has neighboring CH2 groups. The Hs on these CH2 would be split based on their neighbors.

Alternatively, product 3 could be a dialdehyde, which would have Hs on the carbonyl-adjacent CH2.

Wait, but the exact structure is tricky without knowing the previous steps.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a conjugated diene, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a vinyl group, but that's less likely because ozonolysis would break the double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has a structure where a double bond was cleaved, and each end now has a carbonyl group. So the Hs adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

Wait, here's an example: if product 2 has a double bond between C2 and C3, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps as ketones or aldehydes.

Assuming that product 2 is a dienone (a ketone with a double bond adjacent), ozonolysis would split that into two ketones.

But wait, ozonolysis typically cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups. So each end would get a carbonyl. The Hs adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

So, for example, if the structure of product 2 is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', after ozonolysis, it might break into R-CO-CH2-O and R'-CO-CH2-O, but that's not right. Alternatively, each end becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to CH2 groups. The Hs on these CH2 would be next to carbonyls and would be deshielded.

In such a case, the Hs on the CH2 next to carbonyls would each have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

Wait, but if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, perhaps the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH group. But that's less likely.

Wait, another scenario: product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is next to two carbonyl groups. For example, if ozonolysis broke a cyclopropane ring into two carbonyls, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group between the two ketones. So the Hs on that central CH2 would be next to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. That would create a more complex coupling pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, with one neighboring H. That would be a doublet.

But wait, the question is about the most deshielded H. So it's probably next to the most electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, maybe in product 3, the Hs are on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2. So each H on the first CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs on the same CH2 (as a triplet) and by the Hs on the adjacent CH2 (as a quartet). So the coupling would be a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, let's think. If each H on the CH2 is coupled to two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and also to two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (giving a triplet as well), the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets. Or perhaps a doublet of triplets if the coupling constants are different.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled to two Hs on one side and two on the other, the splitting could be a quintet (pentet) if all couplings are similar.

But wait, the Hs on the CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl would be in a deshielded environment, so they would be the most deshielded Hs in the molecule. So their coupling pattern would come from neighboring Hs.

If the structure is such that each CH2 has two Hs, and these are next to another CH2 with two Hs, then each H would couple with two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have 2 + 2 = 4 neighbors, but wait, J values for coupling to each set would be different. So the splitting would be first a triplet from the same CH2 (each H is split by two others into a triplet), and then each of those triplets is split into a triplet again by the adjacent CH2. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, if the coupling constants are similar, it might appear as a pentet (five peaks), but that's more likely when the coupling constants are similar.

Wait, let's think about a simple ethylene glycol structure. If you have CH2(OH)CH2(OH), the Hs on each CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two on the adjacent. But in such a case, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. But in reality, the coupling between adjacent CH2 groups might be through space, leading to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 group next to another CH2, with each H coupled to two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, and option D is pentet.

So which is more likely? Well, if there are two different coupling constants (J1 and J2), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. If the two Js are similar, it might look like a pentet (five peaks). But triplet of triplets would have 3x3=9 peaks, which is rare. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting isn't that complex.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded Hs are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and these CH2s are in a chain where each CH2 is next to another CH2. So each H on the central CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the coupling would be a quartet from each neighbor, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. That would lead to a doublet, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and the adjacent group is a CH that's part of a double bond. But that's getting too speculative.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure where the deshielded Hs are on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and each H is coupled to two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and another two Hs on an adjacent CH2 (triplet). So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets. But that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled to two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and one H on the adjacent CH (doublet). Then the coupling would be a triplet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

Hmm.

Another approach: if the H is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and the adjacent CH2 is also adjacent to a carbonyl, then each H would have coupling to two Hs on their own CH2 (triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So it's a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the adjacent CH2 is in a different environment, perhaps the coupling constants are different, leading to a doublet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, considering the options, I think the most probable coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, so option B.

But wait, another possibility: if the H is on a CH2 group that's between two carbonyl groups. So each H is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on either side, but perhaps one side is a CH2 and the other a CH. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded H is part of an isolated CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is not adjacent to any other CH2 groups. So it would only couple with its two neighboring Hs, giving a triplet. But that's option A.

Wait, but the question specifies the most deshielded H. So perhaps it's a single H, but CH2 has two Hs. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on the CH2 next to a carbonyl are each only coupled to their own two Hs, making them triplets. But that would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another structure where the H is coupled to two Hs from one side and three from another, but that's less likely.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize the possible steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1 → ketone)
   - Product 1 is likely a ketone. So maybe the reaction is a double elimination with each Br replaced by a carbonyl group. But how? Perhaps each Br is on a CH2, and upon elimination of HBr, the CH2 becomes a CO group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diketone.

But how does KOH cause that? Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain.

Assuming product 1 is a diketone, then product 2 is formed by treating with Al(iPr)3. Al(iPr)3 is a Lewis acid used in Friedel-Crafts, but without an aromatic ring, perhaps it facilitates enol formation. So, product 2 would be an enol of the diketone, having a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl.

Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of the double bond in product 2 would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two additional carbonyl groups.

The most deshielded H in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Suppose it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and perhaps that CH2 is between two carbonyls. So each H on this CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and two Hs on each neighboring CH2 groups (each would be a triplet). But if each H is coupled to two Hs on the same CH2 and two on each adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H on the CH2 would have coupling to two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet (from same CH2) and another triplet (from adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure, but given the options, I think the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning behind the answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH at 240°C.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group.  
   - This suggests that the reaction involves elimination or substitution to form a ketone.  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could correspond to protons adjacent to an oxygen atom, and peaks in the 2.41–2.23 ppm region (10H), typical for CH₂ groups adjacent to carbonyls.  
   - Based on this, product 1 is likely a diketone formed via elimination of HBr from the dibromide.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 (the diketone) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely facilitates enolization, forming an enol ether or a compound with a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group (product 2).  
   - The presence of a double bond in product 2 is critical for the next step.

3. **Ozonolysis and workup**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl-containing fragments (product 3).  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.  

4. **Coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - This hydrogen is coupled to two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (forming a triplet) and two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (also forming a triplet).  
   - The combined coupling results in a triplet of triplets.  

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
