Okay, so I have this question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff or something, and then you take the cutoff to infinity in the end. But not all theories need this.

So which theories don't have these divergences? Let me go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't really have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't involve the same level of mathematical infinities. In classical electromagnetism, you might have some singularities at point charges, but I don't think regularization is a thing here. Because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So maybe D is the right answer because it's classical, not quantum.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory and it does have issues with divergences. For example, when calculating the electron self-energy or the vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. So they must use regularization methods like introducing a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So QED does require regularization.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD deals with the strong force and is also a quantum field theory. It has problems with things like Landau poles and issues at high energies, so they must use regularization too. I remember that QCD calculations often use methods like lattice regularization or others to handle the divergences.

Option A) Superstring Theory. String theory is a theory of quantum gravity, right? Wait, but string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same divergences as in other quantum field theories. Because in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings, and the perturbative expansion is different. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization. Or wait, do they still need it for calculations? Because in perturbative string theory, when you calculate loop diagrams, sometimes you can get divergences, but I think string theory handles them in a different way, maybe through the non-perturbative aspects
