Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Additionally, the radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They're assuming the stars radiate as black bodies and want to know by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2.

Hmm, okay. So luminosity... I remember that for stars, luminosity depends on radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, R is radius, and T is temperature. So L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, so the problem is giving me the radii and masses, but I'm not sure how the masses come into play here. Because the question is about luminosity based on black body radiation, which relates to temperature and radius. Maybe the masses are a red herring, or perhaps they're useful in another way, but for this calculation, maybe I can ignore the masses.

Wait, but the problem also mentions the radial velocities. Radial velocity is the speed at which a star is moving towards or away from us. I remember Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. The radial velocity could be used to find the star's velocity, which relates to its temperature via the Doppler effect. Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (around 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, then T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a moment. The radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 isn't moving relative to us, but Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So I think relativistic Doppler shift comes into play here. Because when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength shifts to a longer wavelength. But wait, the peak emission wavelength is determined by the star's temperature. So the observed peak wavelength would be different because of the star's motion. But the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. Oh, wait no, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So does that mean the observed λ_max for both stars is the same? Or is it the intrinsic λ_max? Hmm, I think it's the observed λ_max because that's what the spectroscopy would determine.

So if both observed λ_max are the same, then the Doppler shift affects the measured wavelength. So for Star_2, which is moving away, its light is redshifted. So the intrinsic λ_max of Star_2 would be shorter than what we observe. Let me think. Let me model this.

The Doppler shift formula is (1 + v/c) for recession velocity. So observed wavelength λ_observed = λ_intrinsic * (1 + v/c). Wait, but if a star is moving away, the wavelength is stretched, so λ_observed is longer. If moving towards us, it's blueshifted, shorter wavelength.

In this problem, Star_1's velocity is zero, so its observed λ_max is equal to its intrinsic λ_max. But Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its observed λ_max would be longer than its intrinsic λ_max. But the problem says the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So both observed λ_max are same. So Star_1's observed λ_max is λ1, and Star_2's observed λ_max is also λ1. But Star_2's intrinsic λ_max would be shorter, because its observed λ_max is longer due to redshift.

Wait, so let me model this. Let's denote:

For Star_1: v1 = 0, so observed λ_max1 = λ1 = λ1_intrinsic (since Doppler factor is 1).

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s, moving away, so observed λ_max2 = λ1 (same as Star_1's observed λ_max). But λ_max2_intrinsic = λ1_observed / (1 + v2/c).

So the intrinsic λ_max for Star_2 is λ1 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but the intrinsic λ
