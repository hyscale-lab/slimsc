Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to move at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium-6? Because Li usually has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes 6 nucleons in total. So the nucleus is ^6Li, which has a mass number of 6.

The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. So, it's a relativistic problem because the speed is a significant fraction of c.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m * c².

But wait, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, or the total energy? Well, the options are in GeV, which are typically used for kinetic energy, but sometimes total energy as well. I need to clarify that.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think they mean the total energy, because in particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy. Or maybe not? Hmm, maybe I should check that.

Wait, no. Wait, in particle physics, when you talk about the energy of a particle in a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy. Or, wait, sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The total energy E is gamma * m c². The kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) m c². So the question is, which one are they asking for?

The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed...". I think RHIC is a collider, so the energy they provide is the kinetic energy that the ions have. So perhaps I should calculate the kinetic energy.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me for now proceed assuming that we're to find the kinetic energy. Or perhaps I should calculate gamma and then see.

So first, let's compute gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute
