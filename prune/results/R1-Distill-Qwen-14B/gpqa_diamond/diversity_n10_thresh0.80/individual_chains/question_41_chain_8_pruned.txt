Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I need to figure out the speed of light relative to an observer in the lab. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the glass is moving in the same direction the light is going, but since it's moving toward the observer, that might mean the observer is in front of the direction the glass is moving. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me clarify.

The setup: the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and the observer is in the lab. So the light is going through the glass, and the glass itself is moving. The question is, what is the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab?

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum. But since the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed? Because if the medium is moving, does that add to the speed of light as measured outside?

I'm a bit confused because usually, when a medium is moving, like water moving in a river, the speed of light in the medium would be c/n, but the medium's motion would affect the velocity of the light relative to an external observer. But wait, in classical mechanics, velocities add up, but with light, things are different because of relativity. Oh wait
