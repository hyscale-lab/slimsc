Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates an -OH group, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the problem says it's a very broad peak, which is typical for an O-H stretch in either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a strong absorption around 2500-3300 cm^-1, often a very broad peak. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the peak might be less broad, but sometimes still broad. So I'm not sure yet, but I'll keep this in mind.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't think that's the case here because the options don't include nitrogen. Wait, the options are all O-containing, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone with some conjugation.

Looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have at least one double bond. Maybe it's a substituted alkene, perhaps in conjugation with another group.

Now, the mass spec data shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, what compounds give a fragment of 45? Common fragments... Let me think. A fragment at 45 could be a methyl group with some oxygen, like maybe CH3O or something else. Alternatively, it could be a ketone group fragment. Wait, 45 is a common mass for (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Or maybe it's a fragment from an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group or something like that.

Wait, another approach: figuring out the molecular formula. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let me compute the degree of unsaturation for each.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl protons, so there's a double bond. But with only one DoU, that's a double bond and possibly an oxygen group.

Option B: C6H10O
DoU = (14 -10)/2= 2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and an oxygen group (like an ether).

Option C: C6H10O2
DoU = (14 -10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O
DoU = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a double bond, a ring, or a carbonyl group.

Wait, but looking back at the FTIR, the 1700 and 1650 peaks. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl. So maybe the compound has a carbonyl group. Let's think: if the compound has a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid.

The presence of both 1700 and 1650 suggests perhaps conjugation. For example, an ester has a carbonyl around 1750, but maybe if it's conjugated, it would be lower. Or maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated system.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond. So perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Looking at the options again, which ones have two oxygen atoms? Options A and C are C6H...O2. So if the compound has both a carbonyl group and an O-H group (like a carboxylic acid), then it would have two oxygens. Alternatively, an ester has two oxygens.

Wait, let's think about the IR again. The broad peak at ~3000 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group. So if the compound has both an -OH and a carbonyl group, that would mean two oxygens. So looking at the options, that would point towards C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A).

But wait, let's think about the molecular formula of a possible compound. For example, if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. Wait, for n=3, it's C3H6O2 (like propanoic acid), but that's not the options. Our options are for C6. So perhaps something else.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec fragment at 45. What is that? 45 could be (CH3)2CO, which is
