Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific sky region. They mentioned that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula given in the question is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh wait, yeah, plx is in arcseconds, and distance in parsecs, so plx = 1/distance. So if the distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, so distance r and parallax plx are inversely related. So plx = 1/r, right? Because for a closer star, the parallax is bigger, and for a farther one, it's smaller. So plx ∝ 1/r.

Now, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So substituting plx with 1/r, that becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, that's the rate of change of N with respect to r.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question is about the number of stars as a function of distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number increases rapidly with distance. But the options don't have r^5 as an option for the rate of change; wait, looking back at the options: Option B is r^5, but the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the question is about the differential, like how much the number increases per unit distance. But wait, the way it's phrased, perhaps it's more about the density of stars, like the number per unit volume or something. Or maybe it's about the number in a thin shell of radius r, so the number in a thin shell would be proportional to the surface area times thickness, but I'm not
