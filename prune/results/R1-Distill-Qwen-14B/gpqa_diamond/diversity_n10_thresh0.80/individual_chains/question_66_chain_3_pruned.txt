Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, what do I remember about this? I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I should recall what SMEFT is. SMEFT is an effective field theory that describes the interactions of the Standard Model particles at high energies, incorporating all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the SM gauge symmetry. So, SMEFT is built by adding terms to the Standard Model Lagrangian that are consistent with the SM symmetries, but suppressed by some high scale.

Now, about the symmetries. Let's go through each one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Well, the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because if they didn't, the theory wouldn't make sense as a relativistic quantum field theory. So Lorentz symmetry is a must.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SM and hence SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, because all the operators in SMEFT are constructed from the SM fields, which are Poincare invariant. So any term added must be Poincare invariant. Therefore, operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 (Lorentz and Poincare) are both required.

Wait but wait, the question is about all operators. So if an operator doesn't respect either Lorentz or Poincare symmetry, it's not allowed. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

3. CP symmetry: Hmm. CP is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. Wait, does SMEFT necessarily respect CP? The SM without the Higgs can have some CP violation, but the Higgs can also contribute. So in the SM, CP is not a symmetry because of the CKM matrix and the Higgs. But in SMEFT, operators can include terms that violate CP. For example, operators like (HH†)(HH†) would respect CP, but others might not. Wait, but wait, do the SMEFT operators automatically respect CP? Or is it possible to have CP violation in the operators? Wait, I think SMEFT allows for CP violation because the SM already violates it. So not all operators need to
