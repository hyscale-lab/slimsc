Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. 

The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in a medium. The speed of light v_light in a medium is given by v_light = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, since the glass is moving, do I need to consider the relative motion between the glass and the observer?

Oh right, this might be a case where I have to think about the velocity addition from special relativity. Because the glass is moving, but the speed of light in the medium is different. Or maybe not? Let me think.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. So from the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v, I need to find the speed of the light as seen by someone in the lab.

Wait, but in classical mechanics, velocities just add up. So if the medium is moving at v, and the light's speed in the medium is u, then the lab frame speed would be u + v. But that's only if they are moving in the same direction.

But wait, that can't be right because according to special relativity, you can't just add velocities like that. Because if the speed of the medium is v, the light's speed shouldn't exceed c. 

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. Oh wait, the beam is moving through the glass. So which direction is which? Let me clarify.

The beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving towards the observer. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed c/n. But from the lab's frame, which is moving relative to the glass, we have to compute the speed.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of reference frames. Let's say S is the lab frame, and S' is the glass's frame moving at velocity v relative to S.

In S', the light is moving at speed u' = c/n, right? Because that's the speed in the medium. But in S, the speed u would be calculated using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, but that's for when the light
