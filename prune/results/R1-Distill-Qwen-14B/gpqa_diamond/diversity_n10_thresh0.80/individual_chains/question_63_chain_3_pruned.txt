Okay, so I've got this question here about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have atoms connected by a bond, and their energy states involve both rotation and vibration. The question is about what momentum a photon should have to cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it needs to go to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, but in molecular energy levels, the states are quantized. For a diatomic, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, like in the vibration part. But wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest energy. So I think this might involve a transition from the ground state to the first excited state, but which one—rotational or vibrational?

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state, right? So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, that's the lowest energy. The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably involve promoting the vibrational state, or increasing the rotational quantum number.

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both. The energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. So the fundamental state would be v=0 (lowest vibrational state) and the lowest rotational state, which is J=0 or maybe J=1, depending on the rigid rotor model. Wait no, for rigid rotor, the rotational levels are quantized with J=0,1,2,... and each has (2J+1) degenerate states. So the ground rotational state is J=0.

But when you have rotation-vibration coupling, like in the Morse potential, the energy levels are more complex. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But which transition is lower in energy? Because in the Morse potential, the vibrational energy spacing is larger than the rotational spacing. So promoting a vibrational state would require more energy than a rotational promotion.

Wait, but the question asks for the photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest possible energy transition would be the one with the smallest energy difference. So if the vibrational transition requires higher energy than the rotational, then the next state would be a rotational transition.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: the energy levels for the vibration are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω. Rotational energy is E_rot = (J (J +1)) ħc / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For the ground state, v=0, J=0.

So the energy of the ground state is E0 = (0 +1/2) ħω + (0)(1) ħc/(2I) = ½ ħω.

The first excited state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

Calculating the energies:

For v=1, J=0: E_vib = (1 +
