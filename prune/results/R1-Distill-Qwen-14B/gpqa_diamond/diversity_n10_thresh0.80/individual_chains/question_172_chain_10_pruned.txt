Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'll need to think this through step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (k*T), right? So the formula is n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the population ratio for star_1 is 2:1. Let me denote the population ratios as R1 and R2 for the two stars. So R1 = 2 and R2 = 1.

Wait no, wait. The excitation is twice as high in star_1. So the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2. So the ratio of excited to unexcited (or lower state) would be higher for star_1.

Wait, but I think the ratio is n_high / n_low. So for star_1, n_high_1 / n_low_1 = 2. For star_2, n_high_2 / n_low_2 = 1? Because star_1 has twice as many in the excited state compared to star_2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Alternatively, maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2 times the ratio of star_2. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio n_high / n_low is higher in star_1. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 R2
