Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks at the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the stars are identical in mass, and the planets have similar masses. Interesting.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom (that's 0.005 angstroms) shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, why is one bigger than the other? Oh, right, the RV shift depends on the mass of the planet and how close it is to the star. The formula I vaguely remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) * (1/(P/(2π))^(1/3)) * (1/(1-e²))^(0.5), but wait, maybe that's more detailed than needed.

Wait, I think there's a simpler approximation. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity due to the planet. The formula for v is v = (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (1/(P/(2π))) ) ) ). But since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune-like, so M_p << M_star), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, since the planets are in circular orbits, e=0, so that term becomes 1. So v simplifies to (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) )).

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K:

K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is negligible compared to M_star, and e is zero, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but maybe a better way is to consider that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3))) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ), assuming M_p << M_star, which it is.

So K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/
