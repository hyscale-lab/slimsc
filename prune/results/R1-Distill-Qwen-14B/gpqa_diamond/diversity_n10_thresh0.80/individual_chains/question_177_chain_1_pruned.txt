Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's read it again and break it down.

Alright, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. But the question is about the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T must be same since b is a constant. So T1 = T2.

So if both stars have the same temperature, then the luminosity ratio would just depend on their radii squared. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the answer would be option A) ~2.25.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that come into play?

Oh, maybe the velocities affect the observed wavelength. Like Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its light gets blueshifted or redshifted. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the
