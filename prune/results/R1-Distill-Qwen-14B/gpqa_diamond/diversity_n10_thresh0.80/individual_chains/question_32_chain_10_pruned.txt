Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use relativistic equations.

The question says the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. I need to find the energy of the RHIC that achieves this. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe? Because Li has 3 protons normally, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. But wait, Li has atomic number Z=3, so mass number A=3+3=6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I think the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). So first, I should calculate gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is
