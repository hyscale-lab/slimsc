Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there's a light beam going through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. Wait, no, towards the observer, so the glass is moving toward us. Or wait, same direction as the beam, and toward the observer. Hmm, maybe the beam is moving towards the observer as well. Or perhaps the glass is moving in the direction the beam is going. Wait, the wording says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, maybe the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam relative to the lab, and that movement is towards the observer. Wait, no, perhaps the beam is propagating through the glass, which is itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the direction, but maybe it doesn't matter for the speed calculation.

The main question is the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. Wait, so light's speed in the glass is normally c/n, but since the glass is moving, do we add the velocities? But wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Hmm, right, because when you have moving media, the speed of light isn't simply the vector sum. Oh wait, but this is a non-relativistic case? Because if v is small compared to c, maybe we can use the Galilean addition. Oh, but the problem says to take c=1, so perhaps we need to consider relativistic effects?

Wait, but let me think about this. The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v. So, the glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. But the light is inside the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n. So in the lab frame, what's the speed? Normally, Galilean would say v_lab = v_glass + v_light_in_glass. But that's only correct in the non-relativistic limit. But since the problem includes n and v, perhaps it's using the relativistic approach.

Wait, no. Relativistic velocity addition is more complicated. The formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/c² ), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame. But wait, the glass is moving at v, and the light's speed in the glass is u' = c/n. So in the lab frame, the speed would be (c/n + v) divided by [1 + (v (c/n))/c²] = [ (v + c/n) ] / [1 + (v)/(n c)].

Simplify this. Let's factor out c=1 (since c=1 is given, so c=1 unit, perhaps meters per second). So, u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/(n)).

Hmm, let's compute that. Let me write it as:

u = (v + (1/n)) / (1 + (v/(n))) 

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u = (n v + 1) / (n + v)

So the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab is (1 +n v)/(n + v). Wait, looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n + v). Option B is 1, which would be only if v is zero. Option C is (1 +n v)/(n -v). So our derived formula is option A.

But wait, wait. What if the direction affects the sign? Because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So in the lab frame, the light has its speed as (c/n + v) when using Galilean addition, but using the relativistic formula, the calculation gives (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/(n)).

Wait, but in the problem, the glass is moving toward the observer. So wait, if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going through it, then the light's direction relative to the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm, that might not affect the formula because the expression is about the speed, which is magnitude. But maybe the direction affects the addition. Wait, when the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving through it, perhaps the light's speed in the lab frame is higher than c/n, so the expression would be as we calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the glass is moving in the same direction as the light is propagating, which would be towards the observer. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be c/n plus v, but that's only in Galilean addition. But in reality, according to relativity, the speed doesn't just add. So our earlier approach using relativistic velocity addition is correct.

So the answer should be option A. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think again. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving towards the observer. So the light in the glass's frame is moving at speed 1/n towards the same direction as the glass's movement. So when transforming to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving towards the lab at v), the velocity addition formula would be u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v) / c² ), but with c=1, it's u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

Wait, no, that's when the frame is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the object. So if the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, then in the lab frame, the speed of light is (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v) = (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that's correct.

So the correct option is A.


The problem involves determining the speed of light in a glass medium that is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The index of refraction of the glass is \( n \), and the speed of light in a vacuum is \( c = 1 \).

In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \). Since the glass is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the laboratory, the relativistic velocity addition formula must be used to calculate the speed of light in the laboratory frame. The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory. Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator by multiplying through by \( n \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option B (\( 1 \)) would only be valid if \( v = 0 \), which is not the case here.
- Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)) incorrectly uses \( n - v \) in the denominator, which is not consistent with the relativistic velocity addition formula.
- Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)) incorrectly introduces a negative sign in the numerator, which does not align with the problem setup.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
