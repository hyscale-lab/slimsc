Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The concentrations given are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember stability constants are involved in complex formation. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think: the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^2+n- where n is the number of SCN- attached. So β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^0, β3 for Co(SCN)_3^-2, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4^-3? Or wait, maybe the charge is different. Let me think: Co^2+ with n SCN^- (each -1) would make the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n). So for n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+ (charge 2+ + 1*(-1) = +1). For n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^-2. Wait, no, wait: Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for n SCN, the charge is 2 - n. So for n=1, 2-1=+1. For n=2, 0. n=3, -1. n=4, -2.

Wait but the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is for a successive complex. So the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, the second [Co(SCN)_2]^0, third [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^-2.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- attached, right? So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the second complex. The question is asking for the percentage of this species among all Co species.

But wait, wait. I'm a bit confused. The blue complex is probably the one with two SCN. So that's the beta2 complex, which is β=40. So we need to find the fraction of Co in the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 form.

Wait, but the problem says 'among all cobalt containing species'. So all the species with Co, including Co^2+ and all the complexes.

So the approach would be to find the concentrations of each species, sum them, and then find the percentage of the blue one.

But how do I model the
