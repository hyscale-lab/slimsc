Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So if it's in the fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon, it'll move to a higher state. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe that's the first excited state.

The problem gives me the masses of X and Y: 20 amu and 2 amu. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s. The options are all momenta in N*s, so I need to calculate the photon's momentum.

Photon momentum is p = h / λ, right? And since E = hν, and for a photon, E is the energy of the absorbed photon. So maybe I should find the energy difference between the states and then use that to find the momentum.

But wait, what states are we talking about here? The molecule is in the fundamental state, which in the rotation-vibration model probably means the v=0, J=0 state. The next state with the lowest energy would be either increasing J or v.

Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized with both vibrational and rotational contributions. The total energy is the sum: E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

In the fundamental state, it's the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be either increasing v (v=1) or J (J=1). But since the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, the minimal energy increase. So which transition requires less energy: increasing J or increasing v?

The vibrational energy levels have much larger spacing than rotational. Because the vibrational energy comes from the bond's potential, which is stronger, so the quantum numbers change more. So, increasing v would require more energy than increasing J. So the minimal energy transition would be a change in J, not v.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0,
