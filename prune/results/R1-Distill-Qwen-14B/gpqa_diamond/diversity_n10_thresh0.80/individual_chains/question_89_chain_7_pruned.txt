Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves several reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. First, it's heated with excess KOH to form product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to make product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Alright, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to remember.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with it, especially with excess, it's likely an elimination reaction. So, probably forming an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons in a way that when they eliminate, you'd get a double bond.

Wait, no, actually, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane framework. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so the positions are across each other. So, when KOH is used in a dehydrohalogenation, it would form an alkene. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or wait, perhaps it's a transannular elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, dibromides with two equivalent leaving groups would form a diene? Or maybe a single elimination, but wait, dibromides can eliminate twice if possible. Hmm, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons (in the adamantane structure, which is a diamondoid, so 1 and 3 are not directly adjacent but in a way that the elimination might form a bridged diene or a more substituted double bond).

Wait, I think when 1,3
