Okay, so I have this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, and I need to figure out which one that is.

Let me read the details again. Both planets have the same mass, so their masses don't affect the transit probability. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not larger in radius. I remember that for stars, mass and radius don't always scale linearly. More massive stars can be bigger, but in this case, their radii are the same.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. The main formula I recall is that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and R_s is the star's radius. But wait, since both planets are Earth-like, their radii would be similar, right? So the (R_p)^2 term would be almost the same for both, so maybe it doesn't play a big role here. Or wait, the problem doesn't give planet radii, so maybe that's not the main factor here.

Another thing that affects transit probability is the orbital inclination. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But without knowing the actual inclinations, which we don't, the question probably uses another approach.

Wait, another formula: the probability of a transit is roughly equal to (R_p / R_s) * (a / (2R_s)), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, maybe it's (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (1 / (a / (R_s)) )? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again.

The probability of transit is approximately equal to the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit (in some sense) to the star's size. Specifically, I think it's (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (a / (R_s)), but wait, no. Or perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a /
