Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, parallax is usually denoted by 'p' sometimes, but here it's 'plx', which I think is just another way to write parallax.

Alright, so the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So parallax plx equals 1 over distance r, right? Because as distance increases, parallax decreases. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Or wait, maybe it's plx in arcseconds and r in parsecs, so plx = 1/(r) when r is in parsecs. Yeah, that's correct.

So if plx = 1/r, then plx^5 is (1/r)^5, which is 1/r^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx^5) = r^5. Wait, because 1/(1/r^5) is r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think it's asking about the number of stars per unit distance. So maybe I need to find the derivative of N with respect to r, to see how it changes as r increases.

Wait, let me think again. N is proportional to r^5, so N = k * r^5, where k is a constant. Then, the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is the rate of change of N with r. So the derivative of r^5 is 5 r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but the options don't have r^4 as the answer, unless I'm miscalculating. Let me check the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

Oh wait, option C is r^4. So if the derivative is 5 r^4, then the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me re-express the variables more carefully.
