Okay, I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

So, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is 1.38e-23 J. We're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that each part of the star's atmosphere is in equilibrium with the radiation field. So, the usual formulas from thermal physics should apply here.

Hmm, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the relative populations of different energy levels in a system. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). Oh wait, wait, E_i is higher than E_j if the level is more excited, but wait no—usually, the lower energy levels are more populated because the exponential is negative. So, if the energy difference is ΔE = E_i - E_j, then the population ratio is n_i/n_j = exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)).

Wait, but in the question, star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited. I'm a bit confused. Let me read it again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, I think that means the number of atoms in a higher energy level (more excited) is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So, for a certain energy level, n_i (star 1) is twice n_i (star 2), but wait no, the problem says when compared to star_2. Wait, no, no, wait. No, the question says, "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps the excitation is higher, meaning more atoms are in a higher energy state.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the ratio of populations. Let's say for a specific energy level, say level 2, the population in star_1 is n1, and in star_2 it's n2. The problem states that n1 = 2 * n2? Or is it the other way around
