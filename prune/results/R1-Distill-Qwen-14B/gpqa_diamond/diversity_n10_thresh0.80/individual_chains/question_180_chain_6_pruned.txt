Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, the options are given, so that might help me check my work as I go along. The options are A to D, with some very small numbers and one much larger. Since the charges are all 2e, which is a positive charge, I think the energy here refers to the electric potential energy of the system.

Wait, right, electric potential energy is the energy due to the configuration of charges. Since all the charges are positive, they repel each other, which means the system's potential energy will be positive and will be minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. But in this case, 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So the system is already set up with the 12 charges at a fixed position. Since they can't move, maybe the only energy comes from the interactions between the charge at P and the 12 surrounding charges.

Wait no, wait. Because the 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from P, their positions relative to each other might not change, but each of them would interact with the charge at P. So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies of each of these 12 interactions.

Let me think. The electric potential energy between two point charges is given by U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². In this case, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th charge at point P. So each pair contributes the same amount of potential energy.

So for each of the 12 charges, the contribution would be U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2). Because
