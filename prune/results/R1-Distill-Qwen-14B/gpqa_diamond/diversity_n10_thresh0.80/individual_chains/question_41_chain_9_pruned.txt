Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially involving light, things get a bit tricky because of relativity, but wait, maybe this is a non-relativistic case since the speeds are probably much less than the speed of light.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, let's clarify. The glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, right? Because it says the glass is moving toward the observer and in the same direction as the beam. Wait, no, the light is propagating through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v, towards the observer, but the light is in the same direction as the beam. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the light beam is moving through the glass. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v. The light in the glass has a speed of c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the options don't have c; they take c=1. So the speed in the glass is 1/n. But since the glass is moving, the observer
