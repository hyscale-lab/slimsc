Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see what it's asking.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I think that means the number density of stars is the same everywhere. So, no matter where you look, the number of stars in a given volume is the same. Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, so the answer probably involves some kind of scaling relation.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. But wait, isn't the parallax formula actually plx (in arcseconds) equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs? Yeah, that's right. So, the larger the distance, the smaller the parallax. 

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. Let me think: if we consider a range of plx values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (n) is constant. So, the number of stars in a small volume is n multiplied by the volume of that small region. But wait, how does that translate into parallax terms?

Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), so d = 1/plx. If I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness delta_d, the volume of that shell would be 4π d² delta_d. Because the volume of a spherical shell is surface area (4π d²) times thickness delta_d.

But wait, I'm looking at a range in plx, which is from plx to plx + delta_plx. So, I need to express this in terms of plx. Let me see: plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Also, delta_plx would relate to delta_d. Since plx is 1/d, delta_plx = - (1/d²) delta_d. So, delta_d = - (d²) delta_plx. But since we're dealing with small ranges, maybe the negative sign can be ignored, and we can write delta_d ≈ (1/(plx^2)) delta_plx.

So, the volume element in terms
