Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

Okay, the problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energies, we're usually looking at the electric potential energy between them. Since all the charges are identical, they all repel each other because like charges repel.

Wait, each charge is 2e. So each has twice the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

But wait, the setup is that 12 charges are at 2 m from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is fixed, meaning it doesn't move. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge at P.

But wait, are the 12 charges each at 2 m from P, or are they all arranged in some configuration, each at 2 m from P? Like, perhaps they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m around P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances could vary, but in the minimum energy scenario, how are they arranged?

Wait, the problem says "the minimum energy of this system." So I'm thinking about the potential energy between all the charges. Since the system is isolated, we're considering the electrostatic potential energy.

So the system has two parts: the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 moving charges, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 moving charges.

Wait, but the fixed charge is at P, so each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P. So the potential energy between each moving charge and the fixed one would be the same, right?

So let's break it down. The total potential energy (U) of the system would be the
