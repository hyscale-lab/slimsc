Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. Let's start by understanding each step.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

There are also some hints provided.

Looking at the hints:

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde or ketone with a ylide. So, compound A must be a carbonyl compound, probably a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, the product of the Wittig reaction here is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to visualize that structure. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups. At position 4, there's a substituent which is propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene is an allyl group with a double bond, like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid part, I think. Oh wait, no, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is (propenyl group?), maybe like CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond at a certain position. Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2=C(CH3)-, right? Because propan-2-ene is CH2=CHCH3, but the ylid would have a negative charge on the adjacent carbon. But in the product, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene, meaning it's attached via a double bond. So the product would have a cyclopentane ring with two methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a substituent at 4 which is a propenyl group connected via a double bond.

Wait, the Wittig reaction adds an alkene to the carbonyl. So, the starting material (compound A) must have a carbonyl group. And the ylide would add a double bond to that, forming an alkene in the product.

So if the product has a substituent at position 4 that's propan-2-ylidene, that suggests that the ylide was (propan-2-ylidene)phosphorus something. So the ylide would have a structure like Ph3P=CH-C(CH3)= maybe? Wait, no, wait. The substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the ylide would be something like Ph3P+=CH-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, maybe the ylide is (
