Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first, I need to find the actual state by normalizing it because it's given as proportional, not normalized.

Wait, right. The normalization involves finding the magnitude squared of each component and adding them up. So for |up>, the coefficient is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 because the real part is 1 and the imaginary part is 1. So 1+1 is 2. Similarly, the |down> coefficient is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total squared magnitude is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), right? So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator A. The matrix elements of A are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so what is this matrix? Let me think. For a 2x2 system (since we're dealing with spin up and down), the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Hmm, so what's the significance of this operator? Well, I remember that such a matrix often comes up in the context of spin operators in the x or y direction, but wait, no. Let me think. The Pauli matrices: sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. But here, the matrix A looks like (ħ/2) times sigma_x. Because sigma_x has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on diagonal. So if I multiply sigma_x by ħ/2, I get exactly the matrix A given.

So operator A is (ħ/2) sigma_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x. What are the eigenstates of sigma_x? Oh right, they are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but maybe the question is asking about the eigenstates of A, so perhaps I need to find the eigenstates of A and then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, perhaps the probabilities are the same as when measuring in the x-basis.

But let me proceed methodically.

First, find the eigenstates of A. Since A = (ħ/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2. The eigenstates
