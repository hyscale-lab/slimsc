Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about particle decays. Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, they have to follow certain rules, like conservation laws and energy considerations. The problem gives me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a boson X and some fermions. The mass of the boson is 6 GeV, and I need to find out what particles it can decay into at the lowest order.

First, let's look at the Lagrangian given: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. It looks like the interaction term is proportional to X(y) times some fermion fields. So the boson X is coupling to fermions. The fermions involved are, perhaps, ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure. But the important part is which fermions X can interact with, which determines possible decay channels.

The mass of the boson is 6 GeV. For a decay to be possible, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, a particle can't decay into something that's more massive than itself, as that would violate energy conservation.

So I should think about the possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into. Each pair's combined mass should be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions. The fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), and leptons (electron, muon, tau), plus their antiparticles. But wait, the top quark is way too heavy—its mass is around 173 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks because 6 GeV is way less. So any decay involving top quarks is out of the question. Same goes for the tau lepton, which is about 1.78 GeV, so two taus would sum to about 3.56 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. So possible.

Wait, let me list the masses more precisely:

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV
Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
Charm quark (c): ~1.275 GeV
Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
Top quark (t): ~173 GeV

So, for each fermion pair, the combined mass should be ≤ 6 GeV.

Let's check each possible pair:

1. b quark: mass ~4.13 GeV. So a b and anti-b would sum to 8.26 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b bbar.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the boson mass is 6 GeV. If I have a pair like b and anti-b, each is
