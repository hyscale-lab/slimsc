Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let's try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. So, the observer is in the lab frame, right? And I'm supposed to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, wait. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. What happens when the medium is moving?

Oh right, this is a case where you have to consider the velocity of the medium when calculating the light's speed in the lab frame. So maybe I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, when do I use that? I think the velocity addition applies when changing frames, but here the medium's moving relative to the lab. Hmm.

Wait, the medium (glass) is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v = c/n. But how does that look in the lab frame?

Let me think about frames. The lab sees the glass moving at velocity v. In the glass frame, the light is moving at c/n. So I need to transform the velocity of the light from the glass frame to the lab frame.

I think the relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c^2)), but wait, I might be getting that wrong. Or is it (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). Wait, no, no, I think the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity in the original frame, and u' is the velocity in the new frame moving at velocity v relative to the original.

Wait no, the formula depends on which frame you're transforming from. So the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the glass frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. To find the lab frame speed, I should apply the velocity transformation from the glass frame (where the light is v_light) to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass
