Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”those are situations where the math blows up to infinity, which doesn't make physical sense. So regularization helps make the calculations finite by introducing a cutoff or some other method.

So which theories don't need regularization? Let me think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. So classical theories don't really deal with the same kinds of infinities that quantum theories do. In QED and QCD, you get these divergent loop diagrams, right? Like when calculating the self-energy of an electron or something. But in classical electromagnetism, maybe you don't have those issues because it's not a quantum field theory. So regularization is a quantum mechanics thing. So maybe option D doesn't require regularization because it's classical.

But wait, could there be any case where classical theories need regularization? I'm not too sure. I think classical theories usually handle things without needing such techniques. They just use Maxwell's equations and such, which don't have the same divergent problems as quantum theories do.

So the other options: A is Superstring Theory. I think string theory deals with high energies and is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity. It's a candidate for a theory that unites quantum mechanics and general relativity. But do string theories require regularization? Or do they have some other way of handling things, like maybe they don't have the same divergences because of the way strings work. I'm not exactly sure, but I think string theories might not require the same type of regularization because they're background-independent and have different ways of handling interactions.

Wait, no, I remember that even string theories have some issues with divergences, but perhaps they're handled differently, like through the use of conformal field theories or other methods. Or maybe they don't require the same kind of ad-hoc regularization because of their structure.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has problems with things like confinement and asymptotic freedom. But when it comes to regularization, I think QCD does require
