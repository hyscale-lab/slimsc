Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Hmm, let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, what happens? Oh, I remember something about nucleophilic addition. In the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

So the reaction might be an example of the acid-catalyzed addition of cyanide to a ketone. The mechanism would probably involve the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon. After that, water would leave, but wait, in this case, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN and an acid (like H3O+), the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but wait, actually, when a ketone adds HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the product structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which makes sense. So the reagent A must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+. Looking
