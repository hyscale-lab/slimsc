Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, wasn't it that d (in parsecs) is 1 divided by plx (in arcseconds)? Yeah, I think that's correct. So d = 1/plx.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, let's substitute d into that. Since plx is 1/d, 1/plx would be d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5 because (1/plx)^5 is d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. But wait, wait a second. If N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you look further away, you might expect fewer stars in a given volume. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The number of stars observed might depend on the volume you're observing. The number of stars in a volume is related to the volume itself. Oh right, because if you have a larger volume, you can fit more stars. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr^3, so proportional to r^3. But in this case, our N isn't directly proportional to r^3, it's proportional to d^5. So maybe we're not talking about volume here. Or perhaps the question is simplifying it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of stars per unit volume, but that's not the case here. Wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5.

But the
