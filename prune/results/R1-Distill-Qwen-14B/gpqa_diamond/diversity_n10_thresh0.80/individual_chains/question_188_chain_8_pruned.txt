Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance... Oh right, that's the distance between neighboring atoms in the crystal structure. And the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral structure with all angles equal to 30 degrees.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by 1/d² equals (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by some factor related to the angles. Oh wait, right, because for cubic systems it's simpler, but for rhombohedral, the formula is a bit more complex.

Wait, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Let me recall. I think the general formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * (1/(cos²α - ... something with the angles? Wait, no, perhaps the formula is different. Oh right, the general formula for a rhombohedral system can be written using the unit cell vectors. The interplanar distance is calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, another approach is using the structure factor and the reciprocal lattice. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of length a (since it's a special case of a hexagonal or other systems?), wait no, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal (a = b = c), and all angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, a = b = c, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance for a given (hkl) plane can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hk + kl) cosθ ), but wait, I think I'm getting the factors wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

But in our case, since α = β = γ = 30°, this simplifies a bit. So substituting all angles as 30 degrees.

So for the (111) plane, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.

Plugging into the formula:

d² = a² /
