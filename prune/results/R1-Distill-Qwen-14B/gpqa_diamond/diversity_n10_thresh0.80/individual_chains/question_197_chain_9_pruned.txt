Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different organic compound.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data. Then, I'll consider what reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let me start by looking at the IR spectrum. The IR data shows strong peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But looking at the options, I don't see any amines, so probably an O-H group. Then, a peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl group, like a ketone or carboxylic acid. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, Compound X is likely an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and an O-H group.

Wait, but wait. If the 1720 is a carbonyl, and there's an O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have strong O-H (broad around 2500-3000) and a carbonyl around 1700. But wait, in the IR, the 3400-2500 cm-1 is a broad region, so perhaps it's an O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an alcohol or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehyde O-H isn't that strong. So maybe a carboxylic acid.

But let's look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a very high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, and they are deshielded. Carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm but are broad because of hydrogen bonding. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, so that fits a carboxylic acid proton.

Wait, but wait. The option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have a carboxylic acid group. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, which would also have a carboxylic acid group. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a substituted toluene, no carbonyl. Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, also no carbonyl.

So from IR and NMR, the compound must have a carboxylic acid group. So options A, C could be candidates.

Looking again at the NMR data for the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests two doublets, each integrating to two protons. In a benzene ring, this is typical for a para-substituted structure. The two doublets are probably from two sets of aromatic protons. For example, a para-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, if it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents, like a substituent in position 1 and another in position 4, but perhaps in our case, it's a single substituent that's causing the splitting.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituent is in the para position, and the protons are ortho and meta to it. Let me think. For a para-substituted benzene, the ring protons are in two sets of two, each as doublets. For example, in nitrobenzene, the H's are two doublets. So in this case, the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm correspond to two sets of aromatic protons, each being a doublet. So the substituent is likely in the para position, causing the protons adjacent (ortho) to be deshielded and downfield, and the meta to be less so.

So the substituent is probably in the para position. Let's think about the substituent. The substituent would have a carbonyl group because of the IR peak at 1720 cm-1. So the substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like a carbonyl attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm proton, which is a carboxylic acid. So the substituent is a carboxylic acid group (COOH). So the structure is para-substituted benzene with a COOH group attached? But wait, that would be benzoic acid derivatives.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have the COOH group at position 4? Or wait, no. Let me think: in benzoic acid derivatives, the COOH is in the para position relative to another substituent.

Wait, more accurately, the numbering might be different. Let me think about the structure.

The 1H NMR also shows other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

So, let's break these down. The 1.4 ppm doublet (d, 3H) is probably a CH3 group attached to a CH that is
