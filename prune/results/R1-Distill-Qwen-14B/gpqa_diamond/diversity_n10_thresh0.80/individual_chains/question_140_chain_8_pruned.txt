Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, I remember that water melts at 273 K, so B must be something similar. Wait, 277 K is 4°C, so maybe B is some kind of solid that's close to melting at that temperature. Maybe something like ice? No, wait, ice melts at 273 K. So what else could it be? Perhaps a different compound. Alternatively, maybe B is another substance, but I'll come back to that.

The product when a certain keto acid reacts with X has two oxygen atoms. Okay, so the product has two O atoms. I'm thinking maybe some kind of ester or something, but I'm not sure yet. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, which makes me think of something like NaOH (sodium hydroxide) because it's a strong base used often in reactions. Or maybe something else, like a Grignard reagent. Wait, but Grignard reagents are organometallic, like Mg-based. Hmm.

Wait, the question also says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X is probably a compound with an element that has an isotope. Let's think about elements with common isotopes. For example, chlorine has 35Cl and 37Cl. Or maybe something like oxygen, which has 16O, 18O. But wait, if X is something like NaOH, then the elements are Na, O, H. Let's think about each.

Looking at the reaction: X reacts with Y (liquid) violently. Let's say Y is water, which is a common liquid. So if X is a metal, maybe a metal reacting with water. For example, sodium reacts with water violently, producing H2 gas, right? So gas W would be H2 in that case. H2 has one proton and one neutron, so same number of both. That fits, because the question says W's molecule has same protons and neutrons.

So if Y is water, and X is sodium metal, then the reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2. That makes sense. The precipitate G would be NaOH, but wait, sodium hydroxide is soluble in water. Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another thought: if Y is something else, like a solution of a salt, maybe. Alternatively, maybe Y is not water. Let me think again.

Wait, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. Then, when G is heated, it releases B. So what if G is a carbonate or something that decomposes upon heating? Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide that dehydrates or something.

But let me get back to the product of the reaction with a keto acid. So when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like ketones, but wait, no, a keto acid is an acid with a keto group, like a carboxylic acid with a ketone. Wait, no, maybe it's a ketone acid? Or perhaps it's a ketone and an acid in the same molecule. Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto acid, which is a type of organic acid with a ketone group attached.

Alternatively, when a keto acid reacts with X, which is a base, perhaps an elimination or some reaction occurs. Wait, perhaps X is a strong base like NaOH. If a keto acid (like a beta-keto acid) reacts with a base, it could form a salt and maybe eliminate something, like CO2 or H2O. But the product in this case has two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is a di
