Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO and HIRES. The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various attributes, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both spectrographs.

Let me start by understanding the problem. ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, and HIRES is at the Keck Observatory. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can see stars down to about 17 mag or brighter (since lower magnitude numbers are brighter). HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES). Wait, no—wait, no. Wait, the question says "brighter than X mag." Wait, it's a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says: For ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So, that means the apparent V magnitude of the star should be less than or equal to 17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, stars with apparent V magnitude ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with apparent V mag ≤16. So for a star to be detectable by both, the apparent V magnitude must be ≤16. Because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says, with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, no—wait, magnitude is a tricky scale. Let me get this straight. The apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter objects. So if a spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see stars with V magnitudes <17. Because 17 is fainter than, say, 16. So for a star to be observable by both, it must have apparent V magnitude ≤17 (because ESPRESSO can go up to 17) and apparent V mag ≤16 (because HIRES can only go up to 16). So, to be detected by both, the star must be brighter than 17 mag? No, wait
