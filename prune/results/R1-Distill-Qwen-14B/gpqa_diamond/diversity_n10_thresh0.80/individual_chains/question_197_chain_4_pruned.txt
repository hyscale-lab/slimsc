Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again carefully. 

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product based on the given IR and NMR data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I'll try to figure out what Compound X is. The IR and NMR data should give me clues about its structure.

Looking at the IR data: there are peaks around 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which suggests either an O-H stretch (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or an N-H stretch. But since the options don't have any amines, maybe it's O-H. Then, a strong peak at 1720 cm-1 which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H stretch around 3000-2500, which matches the first IR region. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an ester also has a carbonyl around 1720, but the O-H isn't present. Hmm, I'm not sure yet.

Wait, looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a very high chemical shift, so that's probably an aldehyde proton. Wait no, wait. Wait, the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but it's usually a triplet or something because of coupling. Wait, but maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. But then the 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl. Alternatively, an aldehyde (as in an acid maybe?), but wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe an aldehyde group. But wait, another possibility is an aromatic -OH, but that's usually a broad peak around 5 ppm or so. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which usually indicates an exchangeable proton, like an -OH. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. So perhaps the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but looking at the 1720 cm-1 in the IR, which is a strong carbonyl. So that fits with a carboxylic acid, but wait, carboxylic acids usually have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1700 cm-1, sometimes a bit higher. Also, if it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a benzene ring, maybe it's a benzoic acid. But let's check the NMR.

The NMR also has a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent, and each is a doublet. So that's probably a benzene ring with substituents in para positions.

So putting that together, perhaps the structure is something like a substituted benzoic acid. Let me think: if the substituents are in the para positions, maybe one substituent is a carboxylic acid group, and another is an isobutyl or ethyl group.

Wait, the NMR also shows other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's break that down.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in a ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2. For example, in an isobutyl group. Let's think: the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet integrating for 2H. Maybe that's a CH2 adjacent to another CH. So putting it together, perhaps there's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Wait, maybe more accurately, the isobutyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about splitting.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. In an isobutyl group, the central CH would have two CH2 groups attached: like CH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no, maybe it's a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the structure as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Alternatively, perhaps the group is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- but that might not fit.

Alternatively, the protons at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's an isobutyl group and a carboxylic acid group in the para positions.

Wait, the NMR for the aromatic region: each doublet is 2H. So in para substitution, the two Hs on each adjacent carbon are equivalent. So for a para-substituted benzene, maybe one substituent is a carboxylic acid (COOH) and the other is an isobutyl group.

Wait, but wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is 1H, perhaps the COOH proton. But wait, in a benzoic acid, the COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, and it's a broad peak, which matches the 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) in the NMR.

So putting that together. The benzene ring has a COOH group in one para position and a substituent in the other. The substituent would then be an isobutyl group. Let me think about the substituent's NMR signals.

Looking at the substituent, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is perhaps a methylene group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something like that.

Wait, let me think about the substituent's structure. The ethyl group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH2CH3), a quartet at 1.7 ppm (CH2), and a triplet at 2.9 ppm (CH). Hmm, but wait, that's if it's a propyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an isobutyl group.

Wait, an isobutyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)2. So each of the two methyl groups (CH2CH3) would be attached to a central CH. The central CH would have two CH2CH3 groups attached. But how does that show up in the NMR?

In an isobutyl group, the central CH (the one attached to the benzene ring) would be a CH group with two CH2CH3 groups attached. The central CH would be split into a septet (if it's attached to two CH2CH3 groups), but wait, in this case, the integrating data shows that the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That suggests that the methyl groups on the CH are each split by the neighboring CH.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible substituent. The substituent is probably a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something else. Alternatively, another approach is to look at the molecular formula, but I don't have that. Let me try to reconstruct the structure.

Putting it all together, the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions: one is a COOH group, and the other is an isobutyl group. So the structure would be 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Hmm.

Wait, the substituent, from the NMR, is an isobutyl group. Let me think: the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, an isobutyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)2, but that would have a central CH attached to two CH2CH3 groups. So the CH group would be split into a triplet or something else? Wait, that's probably not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But let me think about the NMR again. The substituent's NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

So, 0.9 ppm t (3H) is a terminal methyl group, like CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm d (3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is a sec-butyl group: that is, the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the substituent is the group attached directly to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me think about the structure:

The CH2CH(CH2CH3) group would have:

- The CH2 adjacent to the benzene ring (attached to the CH(CH2CH3)).

So the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH which is attached to two methyl groups?

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. Then, the CH2 would be split into a triplet or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let's think about each part. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is next to another CH2 group. So perhaps it's a CH
