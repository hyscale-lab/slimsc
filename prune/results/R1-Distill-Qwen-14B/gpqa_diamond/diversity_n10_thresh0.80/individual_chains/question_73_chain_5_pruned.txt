Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the problem states that astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, while astronaut B has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, I think I might have that backwards—like, if one is moving at v1 and the other at v2, then the relative speed from the perspective of the first would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Or wait, no, maybe the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me think, yes, that's correct. So I need to apply this formula.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So the relative velocity of B with respect to A would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have relative speeds of 0.14c. So that narrows it down.

Now for the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity is the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A (2m moving at 0.6c):

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (3m moving at 0.5c):

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So our calculated total energy is approximately 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. For gamma_A: with 0.6c, (0.6)^2 is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64, sqrt is 0.8, reciprocal is 1.25. Correct. So 2m * 1.25 is 2.5 mc².

For gamma_B: 0.5c squared is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. 3m * 1.1547 is approximately 3.464 m c².

Adding them: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964, which is approximately 5.96 mc². So the total energy is 5.96 mc², and relative speed is 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C says 0.14c and 5.96 mc². So the answer should be C.

Wait, but another thought: when adding velocities, does the order matter? Oh, right, because in relativity, the relative speed from A's frame would be (vA - vB)/(1 - vA vB/c²). So I think I did it correctly.

But to be thorough, let me compute it another way. Let me find the velocity of B as seen from A's frame. So v_rel = (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/(c²)) ?

Wait no, when you're in frame S (A's frame), B is moving at vB' = (vB - vA)/(1 - (vB vA)/(c² c)).

Wait, no, if A is moving at vA in the lab frame, then in A's frame, B is moving at (vB - vA)/(1 - (vA vB)/(c²)). Oh wait, I think I confused the terms earlier. Wait, yes, so when you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed of B as seen from A's frame is (vB - vA)/(1 - (vA vB)/(c²)).

Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/(c²)), where u' is the velocity of B in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of A in the lab frame. So from A's perspective (moving at v = 0.6c), B's velocity u' is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would be (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0
