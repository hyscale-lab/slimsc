Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators often correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the states when the observable is measured. The eigenvalue gives the possible result of the measurement.

The operator P is a vector operator with components along x, y, and z. But wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So I think I'm being asked about the operator P in the direction of n. That would be something like P·n̂, right? Because the operator along an arbitrary direction would be the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector in the direction we're interested in.

So the operator for the component of P along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, n lies in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. Because any direction in the x-z plane can be represented as having n_y = 0. So n must be (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So P_n = n_x P_x + 0*P_y + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

I need to find the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to this eigenvalue. But wait, the problem says the eigenvector is along an arbitrary direction, so perhaps I should express the eigenvector in terms of the angles theta and phi that define the direction n. But since n is in the x-z plane, the angle phi (azimuthal angle) would be 0 or 180, because it's along the x-z plane. Wait, no, actually, n is in the x-z plane
