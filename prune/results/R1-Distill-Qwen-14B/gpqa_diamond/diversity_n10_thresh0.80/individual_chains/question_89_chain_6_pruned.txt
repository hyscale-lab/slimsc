Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and then some products are formed through various reactions. The final part is about the NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. Hmm.

First, let me recap the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid (product 1). The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1. 

Wait, what's that IR peak? 1720 is usually a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But since KOH is a base, maybe it's a elimination reaction. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. When treated with a base like KOH, it might undergo dehydrohalogenation, but since it's dihalide, perhaps it's a double elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but with KOH, more likely elimination.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Oh, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is quite rigid. So 1,3-dibromo would have two Br atoms in certain positions. When treated with KOH (a strong base), perhaps an E2 elimination occurs, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. But wait, the product is a solid, and the IR shows a carbonyl. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait â€” elimination would form an alkene, which would have a peak in IR around 1650 or so for the C=C stretch. But here, the IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl (like ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.).

Hmm, so that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But with two leaving groups, perhaps it's forming a ketone. Wait, how? Oh! Wait, maybe it's a double elimination with the base abstracting a proton and the Br leaving, but perhaps it's
