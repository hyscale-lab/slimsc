Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let me try to think through this.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on 1/plx.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The parallax (p) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (d) from us. So, p = 1/d, right? Or wait, the formula is p (in parsecs) = 1/d (where d is in parsecs). So as the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that the number density of stars is constant in space. So, the number of stars in a certain volume of space is proportional to that volume. But wait, how does parallax come into play here?

Parallax depends on distance. So, for a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Let's see. Since plx = 1/d, then distance d = 1/plx. So, if plx is small, d is large, and vice versa.

If I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell would be the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (dd). So the volume element is 4π d² dd.

Now, the number of stars in that volume would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume. Since the distribution is uniform, n is constant. So, dN = n * 4π d² dd.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, instead of thinking in terms of distance, we should express everything in terms of parallax.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let me substitute d in the volume element. So, dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

Hmm, but I need to express this in terms of parallax. Let's think about how parallax changes with distance. So, d is 1/plx, so dd (change in d) would be related to d(plx). Let me compute that.

Differentiating both sides of plx = 1/d, we get d(plx) = - (1/d²) dd. Hmm, but wait, since plx decreases as distance increases, a small change in plx corresponds to a change in distance. Let's rearrange:

dd = - (d^2) d(plx) = - (1/(plx)^2) d(plx).

But since I'm considering a small change in plx (dplx), the negative sign just indicates direction, but for the magnitude, I can ignore it. So, dd = (1/(plx)^2) dplx.

Now, substitute this back into dN.

dN = n * 4π (1/(plx)^2) * (dplx/(1/(plx)^2)) )

Wait, because dd is (dplx)/(plx²). So, let me plug that in:

dN = n * 4π (1/pl
