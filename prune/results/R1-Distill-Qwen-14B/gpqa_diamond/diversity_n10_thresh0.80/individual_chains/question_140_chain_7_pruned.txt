Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a substance similar to it.

Hmm. Let me break this down. Let's start by thinking about the reaction between X and Y. They react violently, so maybe it's a metal reacting with an acid? The gas W is released. Since W's molecule has same protons and neutrons, each atom must be something like H2O? Wait, no. Wait, the molecule itself has same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, no, wait. The molecule has same number of each. Wait, no, the problem says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, maybe it's H2O, but wait, H2O has 2 H (each with 0 neutrons and 1 proton) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So in H2O, total protons: 2 +8 =10. Neutrons: 0+8=8. No, that's not equal. So maybe another gas.

Wait, wait. The molecule's protons and neutrons are equal. So for a molecule, the sum of protons equals sum of neutrons. Maybe CO2? No, CO2 has 2 O (each 8 protons and 8 neutrons) and one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons). Sum protons: 6+16=22. Sum neutrons: 6 + 16*8? Wait, no. Wait, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO2: 1 C (6p,6n), 2 O (8p,8n each). Sum protons: 6 + 8*2 =22. Sum neutrons:6 +8*2=22. Oh! So CO2 would have 22
