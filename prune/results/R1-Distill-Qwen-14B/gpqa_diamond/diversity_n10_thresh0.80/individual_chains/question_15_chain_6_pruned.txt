Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so that the researchers can prioritize their observation time. Let's break down the information given.

First, both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is 3P1.

The host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius, probably because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same size. Interesting, so same radii but different masses.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5)) )... Wait, no, wait. Actually, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2)^0.5 ), but I might be mixing some terms here. Or maybe it's better to think about the geometric probability.

Wait, geometric probability for a planet to transit is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by the impact parameter, but I think the main factor is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the size of the star. Hmm, no, wait. The probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star to the distance in the plane of the sky as seen from Earth. Oh, right, the transit probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit projected onto the sky. Or more accurately, the probability is (R_s / a)^2, where R_s is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Wait, but that can't be right because units don't match. Hmm.

Wait, no. I think the transit probability is calculated as (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2 * (1 - e²)), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), it simplifies. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The geometric probability is (R_p + R_s)² / (
