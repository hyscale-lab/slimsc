Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a 1000 K temperature difference. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by these spots. The star is being observed, and as it rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations—like when a planet transits a star, blocking some light. But the question is, what exoplanet radius would produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

Hmm, so the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) and figure out what planet radius would cause the same change.

First, I remember that the brightness change when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the planet blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the square of their radii ratio. That makes sense since the area blocked is πR_planet² divided by πR_star², so the ratio is (R_planet/R_star)^2.

But wait, in this problem, the situation is a bit different. The star isn't a single, uniform brightness. One hemisphere has spots that are cooler, so when part of the spotted area is facing us, the total brightness decreases. But I need to model how much the brightness changes when the spots rotate into and out of view.

The problem says the star's one hemisphere is 20% filled with spots. So, perhaps the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's surface. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total spot coverage on the star would be 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1, or 10% of the star's total surface area. But wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered, so total area is 0.2 * (π R²/2) = 0.1 π R².

But each spot is cooler by 1000 K. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, so the spots are 5000 K. The brightness variation would depend on how much less light the spots emit compared to the rest of the star.

The flux from the star without spots is F = σ T_eff^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The spots have F_spot = σ (T_eff - 1000)^4 = σ (5000)^4.

The brightness change when the spots are visible would be the difference in flux when a spot is in front of the star compared to when it's not. But wait, the star is rotating, so as the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the observed flux decreases because the spots are cooler. The brightness variation would be the difference between the normal flux and the flux when spots are covering part of the disk.

Wait, no. Actually, the total flux when spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the unspotted parts and the spotted parts. The unspotted parts are at 600
