Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. The question is about how this situation can mimic an exoplanet in terms of brightness variations, and we need to find the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the star to produce the same light curve amplitude.

Wait, the setup is that the star has spots, and when it rotates, the spots come into view, causing changes in brightness. From Earth's perspective, this makes the star's brightness vary over time. But if the star didn't have spots, what size planet would cause the same brightness change when it transits the star?

So the key is to calculate the relative brightness change (the amplitude) caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

First, let me think about the brightness variation due to the spots. The star's total brightness without spots is based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star appears dimmer.

But wait, the star's hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor means the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the star's surface is a sphere. So the entire surface area is 4πR². But one hemisphere is covered, so that's 2πR². The filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR², so the spot area is 0.4πR². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4πR² /4πR² = 0.1, which is 10% of the total surface area. Alternatively, the problem says that one hemisphere is spotty with a 20% filling factor, so the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, which is 20% of 2πR², so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So that's correct.

But when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since it's a hemisphere, the spots would be on one side. So when the star rotates, the spots that were facing away come into view. Wait, no. If the star is rotating, and we're looking at it edge-on, the spots would be on the limb, perhaps. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the star's rotation causes the spots to come into the field of view, so the brightness would vary as the spots rotate in and out of view.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the brightness variation as the spots being on one side, and as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing a dip in brightness when the spots are on the front.

But wait, the star's rotation period would cause the spots to be visible for a certain time, leading to a periodic dip. But for our purposes, we need to compute the change in brightness caused by the spots.

The star's total brightness is the sum of the brightness from the normal regions and the spotted regions. The brightness from a part of the star depends on its temperature squared (since the flux is proportional to T^4, but wait, flux is σT^4, so for a given area, the flux is area * σT^4. So when calculating the total flux, it's the sum of the normal parts and the spots.

So the total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π R² * σ T_eff^4.

Wait, but for the star, the total flux is L = 4π R² σ T_eff^4. So the surface brightness (flux per unit area) is F_surface = σ T^4.

So when the spots are present, the area of the spots is A_spot = 0.4 π R². The surface brightness of the spots is T_spot = 5000 K (since 6000K -1000K =5000K). So the flux from the spots is F_spot = A_spot * σ T_spot^4.

The flux from the rest of the star is F_rest = (4π R² - A_spot) * σ T_eff^4.

Wait, but when the star is viewed as a whole, the spots are either on the front or the back. So when the spots are facing us, the total flux is F_rest + F_spot. When they are on the back, the total flux is F_rest (because the spots can't be seen). So the variation in flux is F_spot when the spots are visible minus when they are not.

Wait, no. Actually, when the spots are on the side facing us, their lower brightness reduces the total flux compared to when they are on the far side, which doesn't contribute to our observation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the change in brightness when the spots are visible. The maximum flux (when no spots are visible) is F_max = F0 - F_spot, because the spots are on the far side and their lower flux isn't contributing. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, let me think again. The star's total flux is the sum of all the areas we can see. So when the spots are on our side (the front), the flux is F_front = (normal surface area) * σ T_eff^4 + (spot area) * σ T_spot^4.

Wait no, the normal surface area is the entire star except the spots. So F_front = (4π R² - A_spot) * σ T_eff^4 + A_spot * σ T_spot^4.

When the star rotates so that the spots are on the back, we can't see them. So F_back = (4π R² - A_spot) * σ T_eff^4.

So the brightness variation (ΔF) is F_back - F_front.

Wait, no. When the spots are on the front, the flux is lower than when they're on the back. So the maximum flux is F_back, and the minimum is F_front. So the variation is F_back - F_front.

So ΔF = F_back - F_front.

Let me compute that.

F_back = (4π R² - A_spot) * σ T_eff^4.

F_front = (4π R² - A_spot) * σ T_eff^4 + A_spot * σ T_spot^4.

ΔF = F_back - F_front = - A_spot σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

But since T_spot is lower, T_eff^4 is larger than T_spot^4, so ΔF is negative, meaning the flux is lower when the spots are in front. But we're interested in the amplitude of the variation, so we can take the absolute value.

Alternatively, the change in flux is the difference between when the spots are in front and when they're not. So when the spots are visible, the flux is F_front, which is less than F_back.

So the change is F_back - F_front = A_spot σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the fractional change is ΔF / F_back.

Wait, but F_back is the flux when the spots are not visible (they're on the back), so the maximum flux is F_back. The minimum is F_front.

So the fractional variation is (F_back - F_front)/F_back.

Compute that.

Let me compute the numbers.

Given:

T_eff = 6000 K

T_spot = 5000 K

A_spot = 0.4 π R². Since the star's radius R is same as Sun's, but the exact value might not matter because we'll compute ratios.

Compute F_back = (4π R² - 0.4π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

= (3.6 π R²) σ (6000)^4.

F_front = (3.6 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

So ΔF = F_back - F_front = [3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 ] - [3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

Which simplifies to ΔF = - 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

Wait, but that's the change in flux from front to back. So when the spots are in front, the flux is lower by 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

So the fractional change is (ΔF)/F_back = [0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ] / [3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 ]

Simplify.

The R², σ, and π terms cancel out.

So ΔF/F_back = (0.4 * 5000^4 ) / (3.6 * 6000^4 )

Compute that.

Let me compute 5000^4 and 6000^4.

But maybe I can compute the ratio (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4.

Let me compute that.

0.8333 squared is 0.6944.

Squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4≈0.4823.

So the ratio becomes:

(0.4 * 0.4823) / (3.6 )

0.4 * 0.4823 ≈ 0.1929.

Divide by 3.6: 0.1929 / 3.6 ≈ 0.0536.

So fractional change ΔF/F_back ≈ 0.0536, or about 5.36%.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness variation due to spots is similar to the presence of a planet. So when a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the light. The amplitude of the dip is proportional to the area blocked.

For a planet with radius R_p, the area blocked is π R_p². So the fractional change when the planet transits is (π R_p²) / (4 π R_star²) ) = (R_p / R_star )^2 * (1/4) * π/π cancels, so (R_p/R_star )^2 * 1/4?

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, the area of the planet's disk is π R_p². The area of the star is π R_star² * 4 (since it's a sphere, but when viewed from the side, the area is π R_star² when the planet transits).

Wait, no. When a planet transits, it blocks a circular area of π R_p² on the star's disk, which has an area of π R_star² (since we see the star's face as a circle of radius R_star). So the blocked area is (π R_p²) / (π R_star²) = (R_p / R_star )^2.

So the fractional change in flux is (R_p / R_star )^2.

But wait, in the case of the spots, the fractional change is about 5.36%, as computed earlier.

So we need to set this equal to the planet's fractional change.

So (R_p / R_star )^2 = 0.0536.

Take square root: R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.0536) ≈ 0.2317.

Wait, but wait, that would suggest R_p is about 23% of R_star. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relative brightness change when the spots are present.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star's brightness when the spots are on the side (facing us) versus when they're not. So when the spots are visible, the brightness is lower.

Wait, another approach: The star's brightness when spots are visible is F_spot_visible = F_normal + F_spots.

Wait, no, when spots are on the front, the flux comes from the normal regions plus the spots.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the ratio of the flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not.

Flux when spots are visible (F1) = flux from normal regions + flux from spots.

Flux when spots are not visible (F0) = flux from normal regions (since the spots are on the other side and not visible).

So F1 = F0 - (F_spots_on_front - F_spots_on_back).

Wait, no. Alternatively, since when the spots are on the front, their lower flux contributes, so F1 = F_normal + F_spots.

But when the spots are on the back, their flux doesn't contribute, so F0 = F_normal.

Wait, F_normal is the flux from the entire star except the spots, and F_spots is the flux from the spots when they are on the front.

Wait, perhaps the total flux when the spots are visible is F_normal + F_spots.

When the spots are on the back, their flux isn't seen, so F0 = F_normal + F_spots_on_back.

Wait, but the spots on the back would still emit flux, but since they're on the back, we don't receive it. So F0 = F_normal + F_spots_on_back (which is zero, because we can't see them). So F0 = F_normal.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F1 = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4 + A_spot σ T_spot^4.

When the spots are not visible, the flux is F0 = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

Wait, no, because when the spots are on the other side, their flux doesn't contribute to our observation. So F1 = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4.

Because the A_spot area is on the back, so we don't see the spots' lower flux.

Wait, that can't be. Because when the spots are on the front, the flux is:

F1 = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4 + A_spot σ T_spot^4.

When the spots are on the back, F0 = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4 + A_spot σ T_eff^4.

Because the spots are on the back, their temperature is T_eff, not lower. Wait no, the spots are cooler, but their temperature is still T_spot regardless of where they are on the star. Wait, no, their temperature is T_spot regardless. So when the spots are on the front, their contribution is A_spot σ T_spot^4. When on the back, their contribution is A_spot σ T_spot^4 but not seen, so F0 remains as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about this again.

The star's total flux is the sum of all the surface areas we can see. So when the spots are on the front, their lower temperature contributes to the flux. When the spots are on the back, their lower temperature doesn't contribute because we can't see that part of the star.

So F0 is the flux when the entire star's surface (including the spots) is at Teff. But in reality, the spots are cooler, so when they are on the front, the flux is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

With spots, when the spots are on the front, the flux is F1 = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4 + A_spot σ T_spot^4.

When the spots are on the back, the flux is F0, because the spots are not visible. So the variation is between F1 and F0.

Wait, but that can't be right because F0 is the star's full flux with spots. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

An alternative approach: The star's total flux is always F0 = 4π R² σ T_eff^4. The spots have a lower temperature, so when a spot is on the front, it contributes less flux than it would if it were at Teff.

So the flux when a spot is visible is F1 = F0 - (A_spot σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)).

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F0 - F1)/F0 = [A_spot σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / F0.

So let me compute that.

A_spot = 0.4 π R².

F0 = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

So (F0 - F1)/F0 = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4)] / (4 π R² σ 6000^4 )

Simplify:

= [0.4 * (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / (4 * 6000^4 )

Compute the terms:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 =5^4 *1e12=625e12.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1296e12 - 625e12 = 671e12.

So numerator: 0.4 * 671e12 = 268.4e12.

Denominator: 4 * 1296e12 = 5184e12.

So the ratio is 268.4e12 /5184e12 = 268.4 /5184 ≈ 0.0517.

So approximately 5.17% variation.

But wait, the question says that the star's variation is similar to an exoplanet. So when the planet transits, it blocks some light. The amplitude is the same as the star's variation.

So the planet's transit causes a fractional change equal to (R_p / R_star)^2.

Set that equal to 0.0517.

So (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.0517 → R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

But wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, 0.227 isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should model the spot's contribution differently. Oh wait, perhaps the way I computed the change in brightness is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the variation is larger. Because when the star is spotty, the brightness when the spots are facing us is lower, and when they're not, it's higher. So the peak-to-peak variation is 2 times the dip.

Wait, no, because the dip is when spots are visible, and the peak is when they're not. So the maximum flux is when the spots are not visible, and the minimum is when they are.

So the variation is (F0 - F1) where F0 is when the spots are not visible, F1 when they are.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, the variation was about 5%, which would correspond to a planet of about 0.227 R_star. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area of the spots. Let me double-check.

The problem says that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

The hemisphere's area is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the spot area is 0.4 π R².

But wait, another approach: When the star rotates, the spots are on the front (facing us) for a certain period, and on the back otherwise. So the observed brightness will dip when the spots are on the front.

The total change in flux is the difference between when the spots are on the front and when they're on the back.

When the spots are on the front, the flux is F_spot_visible = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4 + A_spot σ T_spot^4.

When the spots are on the back, the flux is F_spot_invisible = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4 + A_spot σ T_spot^4 (because the spots are on the back, but their T is T_spot, so their contribution to the flux is the same as when they're on the front? Wait, no, because when the spots are on the back, their flux doesn't reach us. So F_spot_invisible would be the same as (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4, because the spots' contribution is not seen.

Wait, perhaps that's the correct way.

So F_spot_visible = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4 + A_spot σ T_spot^4.

F_spot_invisible = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4.

So the variation is F_spot_invisible - F_spot_visible = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4 - [ (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4 + A_spot σ T_spot^4 ].

Which simplifies to -A_spot σ (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) = A_spot σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ).

So the change is positive, meaning F_spot_invisible is higher than F_spot_visible.

So the fractional change is (F_spot_invisible - F_spot_visible) / F_spot_invisible.

Compute that.

F_spot_invisible = (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4.

So [A_spot σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [ (4π R² - A_spot) σ T_eff^4 ]

Cancel σ.

So [A_spot (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [ (4π R² - A_spot) T_eff^4 ]

Substitute A_spot = 0.4 π R².

So [0.4 π R² (6000^4 - 5000^4)] / [ (4π R² - 0.4 π R² ) * 6000^4 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Denominator becomes (4 - 0.4) π R² = 3.6 π R².

So [0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [3.6 π R² * 6000^4 ]

The π R² cancels.

0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) / (3.6 *6000^4 )

As before, compute 6000^4 = 1.296e16, 5000^4=6.25e15.

Wait, wait, wait: 6000 is 6e3, so 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12=1.296e15.

Similarly,5000^4 =5^4 *1e12=625e12=6.25e14? Wait, no, 5^4 is 625, and (5e3)^4 is 625e12=6.25e14? Wait, no, 5e3 is 5000, (5e3)^4 = (5^4)*(1e3)^4 )=625 * 1e12=6.25e14.

Wait, 6000^4 is (6e3)^4 =6^4 * (e3)^4 = 1296 *1e12=1.296e15.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 =1.296e15 -6.25e14= (12.96e14 -6.25e14)=6.71e14.

So numerator is 0.4 *6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Denominator:3.6 *1.296e15=4.6656e15.

So ratio:2.684e14 /4.6656e15 ≈ 0.0575, which is about 5.75%.

So the fractional change is approximately 5.75%.

So when the planet transits, the fractional change is (R_p / R_star)^2.

Set that equal to 0.0575.

So R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.0575) ≈ 0.2398, about 0.24.

Again, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, 0.24 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the spots affect the brightness. Another possibility is that the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star is viewed, the spots take up half the star's disk when they are in front. So the maximum area blocked by the spots is when the spots are in the center of the disk.

Wait, or perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to cover a certain portion of the visible disk as it rotates. Wait, but the problem states that one hemisphere is spotty, so regardless of rotation, half the star's surface is spotted.

Wait, no, when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere will show a varying amount of spots in our view. For example, when the star is viewed from Earth edge-on, as it rotates, the spots will come into view and then go out of view, but since it's a hemisphere, when the spot side is facing us, we see the full 20% of that hemisphere. So the maximum spot coverage is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 20% of (2π R²) =0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star's total area is 4π R². So the fraction of the area covered by spots when they are on the front is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, or 10% of the entire star's surface.

So when the spots are in front, 10% of the star's disk is cooler, leading to a dip in brightness.

Wait, but perhaps the effective area that's blocked when the planet transits is a circle. So the area blocked is π R_p^2, and the star's area is π R_star^2.

So the fractional change is (π R_p^2)/( π R_star^2 )= (R_p/R_star)^2.

So setting (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.1, that would give R_p = R_star * sqrt(0.1) ≈ R_star * 0.316, which is about 0.32. That's option D.

Wait, but earlier calculations with the spots gave a fractional change of about 5.75%, which is 0.0575, not 0.1.

Wait, perhaps I confused the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots (10%) with the flux change. Because if the spots are cooler, the fractional change in brightness isn't directly the same as the area fraction.

Wait, in the previous calculation, the fractional change was about 5.75%, not 10%. So why is there a discrepancy here?

Ah, because the spots are cooler, their presence doesn't reduce the flux by the same proportion as the area they cover. For example, a 10% area reduction would be a 10% dip in brightness if the spots were completely dark, but since they're just cooler, the dip is less.

So the dip is 5.75%, which would correspond to a planet blocking 5.75% of the star's light.

So the planet's area is 5.75% of the star's area.

So (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.0575 → R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.0575) ≈ 0.2398.

Which is about 0.24, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the exact area, but the maximum possible. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and the correct way is to model the situation as a planet blocking a certain area, leading to the same flux dip as the spots.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the brightness variation as the difference between the star's flux with and without the spots, considering the entire surface.

Wait, another approach: The star's total flux is F = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

The spotted area is A_spot = 0.4 π R², and the rest is normal.

So the flux without spots is F = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

With spots, the flux is F' = (4π R² - A_spot) σ Teff^4 + A_spot σ T_spot^4.

The fractional change is (F - F')/F.

Compute that:

(F - F')/F = [A_spot (σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) ] / (4π R² σ Teff^4 )

Which is [A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4π R² Teff^4 )

Substitute A_spot = 0.4 π R².

So [0.4 π R² (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 π R² 6000^4 ]

Again, the π R² cancels.

0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 *6000^4 )

As before, 6000^4 -5000^4 ≈ 6.71e14.

So 0.4 *6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Divide by 4*6000^4=4*1.296e15=5.184e15.

So 2.684e14 /5.184e15 ≈0.0517, which is 5.17% fractional change.

So the fractional change is about 5.17%.

Set this equal to the planet's fractional change, which is (R_p/R_star)^2.

So R_p/R_star = sqrt(0.0517) ≈0.227, about 0.23.

Again, not matching any options.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct calculation is that the planet's radius is 0.1 R_star, which is option B (0.07) or C (0.11), but 0.23 isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area.

Wait, the spot is on one hemisphere, so the area is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 20% of 2π R², so 0.4 π R².

But when considering the star's disk as seen from Earth, the maximum area blocked by the spots would be when the spot is at the center of the disk.

So the area blocked in that case is 0.4 π R².

But when the star is viewed as a whole, the area is 4π R².

So the maximum dip would be 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, or 10%. But considering the lower temperature, the dip would be less.

Wait, no, because the dip isn't just the area; it's the difference in flux from the area. So the dip is (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) over the area.

So perhaps the dip is 10% of the area, but each part is  (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/(Teff^4) in brightness. So the dip is 10% * (1 - (5000/6000)^4).

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So the dip is 10% * 0.5177 = 5.177%, which matches our earlier calculation.

So the dip is about 5.177%.

So the planet would need to have a radius that blocks 5.177% of the star's light, which is (R_p/R_star)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p/R_star ≈ 0.227.

But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is the other way around. The situation with the spots can mimic an exoplanet, so the same light curve amplitude would be produced by a planet whose radius is such that its transit causes a dip of the same amplitude as the spots' effect.

So perhaps the spot-induced dip is 5.17%, and the planet's radius is such that its dip is also 5.17%, which would require R_p/R_star ≈0.227.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option D, ~0.32, which is about 0.32.

Wait, but 0.32 squared is about 0.1, which would give a dip of 10%, not 5%.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible brightness variation, which could be when the entire hemisphere is visible. But the filling factor is 20%, so the spot area is 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the star's total surface area.

Wait, another approach: The maximum possible brightness variation due to the spots would be when the entire hemisphere is covered, but in this case, the filling factor is 20%, so it's a quarter of that. Hmm, no, filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the star's rotation and the spots' visibility, but instead that the star's brightness varies as the spots rotate into view. So when the star has spots on one hemisphere, the maximum variation is when the spot is at the center of the disk. So perhaps the area is 0.2 * (π R²) (since the hemisphere's area is 2π R², and 20% of that is 0.4 π R²).

Wait, but when the spot is at the center, the area blocked is π (R_p)^2. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spot is in front, but perhaps it's only a part of the star's disk.

Wait, perhaps I should model the maximum possible dip when the spot is fully visible. The spot's area is 0.4 π R², so the maximum dip would be (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10%. But considering the lower temperature, the dip is 10% * (1 - (5000/6000)^4) ≈10% * 0.5177=5.177%.

So the planet has to cause a dip of 5.177%, which corresponds to (R_p / R_star)^2 =0.05177 → R_p/R_star=0.227.

Hmm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the spot's flux. Let me recompute the fractional change.

Compute (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Teff =6000, T_spot=5000.

(6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = (1.296e15 -6.25e14)/1.296e15 = (6.71e14)/1.296e15 ≈0.5177.

So the fractional dip per unit area is 0.5177.

The area of the spot is 0.4 π R².

So the total dip is (0.4 π R²) * 0.5177 / (4 π R²) )= (0.4 *0.5177)/4 = (0.20708)/4=0.05177.

Which is 5.177%.

So the same dip would be caused by a planet blocking (R_p/R_star)^2 =0.05177 → R_p=0.227 R_star.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the star's entire surface is observed, and the spots are on both hemispheres. Wait, no, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty.

Wait, another thought: The star's rotation would cause the spots to move into and out of view, but perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the spot is at the center of the disk, and the minimum when it's not. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as if a planet with a certain radius was transiting.

Wait, but this doesn't change the calculation; it's the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the question is looking for the planet's radius to produce the same maximum dip, which is 0.1 (10%), which would correspond to R_p/R_star= sqrt(0.1)= ~0.316, which is option D) ~0.32.

But earlier calculation shows that the dip due to spots is about 5%, not 10%.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is 10% when the spots are on the front, and 5% when considering the lower temperature.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the star's brightness varies between when the spots are visible and when they're not. The maximum dip is when spots are fully visible, which is 0.4 π R² * 0.5177, leading to 5.17% dip.

So the planet must cause a 5.17% dip, so R_p/R_star= sqrt(0.0517)=0.227, but the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relative change in brightness when the spots are on the front compared to the star without spots.

Wait, the star without spots would have F0=4π R² σ (6000)^4.

With spots, when the spots are on the front, F= F0 - A_spot σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

So the dip is (F0 - F)/F0 = [A_spot (6000^4 -5000^4)] / (4π R² 6000^4 )

As computed earlier, that's about 5.17%.

So the planet must cause the same dip.

So (R_p/R_star)^2=0.0517 → R_p/R_star= ~0.227.

But again, no option matches.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → (0.39)^2=0.1521 → dip of ~15% → way too high.

B) ~0.07 → dip 0.0049 → too small.

C) ~0.11 → dip ~0.0121 → 1.2%.

D) ~0.32 → dip ~0.1 → 10%.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D, but that would require the dip to be 10%, which is higher than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the area of the hemisphere, not the entire star.

Wait, maybe the maximum dip is 20% of the hemisphere's area. Since the hemisphere's area is 2π R², 20% is 0.4 π R².

So the dip would be 0.4 π R² / (4 π R²) )= 0.1 → 10% dip.

But that's without considering the temperature difference. So the dip would be 10% * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈10% * (1-0.4823)=10% * 0.5177=5.177%.

So the same dip would require a planet of R_p= ~0.227 R_star, which isn't an option.

Unless perhaps the question is assuming that the spots cause a 10% dip, and the planet's dip is 10%, leading to R_p=0.316 R_star, which is option D.

But that doesn't match the actual calculation, which is about 5.17%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the relative change in brightness when the star is not covered by spots. So the scenario is, if the star was not covered by spots, what planet would produce the same amplitude as the spots do.

Wait, the question says, "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?"

So the scenario is, without spots, the star's brightness wouldn't vary. So the planet's transit would cause a dip of R_p^2/R_star^2.

The spots cause a dip of 5.17% when the star is spotty. So the planet must cause the same dip, 5.17%, which implies R_p/R_star= ~0.227.

But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the planet to cause the same amplitude when the star is not spotty. So, without spots, the star's brightness is flat, and the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_star)^2. The spot's presence causes a dip of 5.17%, so the planet's dip must be 5.17%, leading again to R_p= ~0.227 R_star.

But again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of the fractional change. Let me recompute it.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4=6.25e15.

So difference: 1.296e16 -6.25e15=6.71e15.

Wait, no, 1.296e16 is 12.96e15, so 12.96e15 -6.25e15=6.71e15.

So (6.71e15)/(1.296e16)= approx 0.5177.

Then, the area fraction is 0.4 pi R^2 /4 pi R^2 =0.1.

So 0.1 *0.5177=0.05177.

So fractional change is ~5.177%.

So the planet's R_p must satisfy (R_p/R_star)^2=0.05177 → R_p= sqrt(0.05177) * R_star ≈0.227 R_star.

But no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32, which would correspond to a dip of 10%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spot covers the entire hemisphere, leading to a 20% area coverage (since hemisphere is 50% of the star), but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, which would lead to a 20% area coverage, but the problem states that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's light is modulated by the spots' rotation, leading to a dip of 20% of the hemisphere's area, but that's not quite correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to cover 20% of the visible area. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, and the maximum coverage is 20% of the visible hemisphere, which is 20% of 2 pi R^2, but that's 0.4 pi R^2.

So the maximum dip is 0.4 pi R^2 /4 pi R^2=0.1, 10%. But considering the lower temperature, dip is 5.177%.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the brightness variation as the same as a planet blocking the same area, but perhaps the spot's effect is when it's on the near side, leading to a dip, but the star's total flux is F = F0 - (A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )).

So the dip is (A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / F0.

Which we calculated as ~5.177%.

So the planet's dip must be the same, leading to R_p= ~0.227 R_star.

But no option matches, so perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121)= ~0.11, but that's not matching 5.17%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the spot's area. Let me check.

The problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Hemisphere area is 2 pi R^2, so 20% is 0.4 pi R^2.

Correct.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem wants the same signal as the star's brightness variation, which is 5.17% dip. So the planet's radius must be such that (R_p/R_star)^2 =0.0517 → R_p=0.227 R_star.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is D) ~0.32, which would correspond to a dip of 10%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct dip is 10%, leading to R_p=0.316, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible dip, which is when the entire hemisphere is covered, leading to a 50% dip in area, but that's not the case here.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Given the options, and the calculations, I think the intended answer is D) ~0.32, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, and the planet's radius must be such that when it transits, it causes the same variation. So perhaps the planet's area is 20% of the star's area, which would mean (R_p/R_star)^2=0.2 → R_p= ~0.447 R_star. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the planet's transit area is the same as the spot area. So the planet's area is 0.4 pi R^2, but the star's area is 4 pi R^2, so (R_p/R_star)^2=0.4 pi R^2 /4 pi R^2=0.1 → R_p= ~0.316 R_star, which is option D.

Ah, that makes sense. So the planet's area is 0.4 pi R^2, which is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the fraction is 0.4 pi R^2 /4 pi R^2=0.1 → R_p=0.316 R_star.

So the answer would be D) ~0.32.

But wait, this ignores the temperature difference of the spots. Because the planet is completely blocking the light, while the spots only reduce the flux in the area they cover.

Ah, right! So the dip caused by the planet is (R_p/R_star)^2, while the dip caused by the spots is (A_spot/R_star^2) * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4).

So the planet's dip is (R_p/R_star)^2.

The spot's dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈0.1 *0.5177=0.0517.

So to have the same dip, (R_p/R_star)^2=0.0517 → R_p=0.227 R_star.

But again, no option matches.

But if the problem ignores the temperature difference and just considers the area, then the dip would be 0.1, leading to R_p=0.316 R_star (option D).

So perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Temperature of the spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Spot Area**:
   - The hemisphere's surface area is \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The area covered by spots is \( 20\% \) of the hemisphere:  
     \[
     A_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is:
     \[
     F_{\text{total}} = 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4.
     \]
   - When the spots are visible, the flux is reduced by the cooler spots:
     \[
     F_{\text{spot\_visible}} = F_{\text{total}} - A_{\text{spot}} \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4).
     \]
   - The fractional brightness variation is:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_{\text{total}} = \frac{A_{\text{spot}} (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
     \]

4. **Calculation of Fractional Change**:
   - Substituting \( A_{\text{spot}} = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \Delta F / F_{\text{total}} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma 6000^4}.
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_{\text{total}} = \frac{0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{4 \times 6000^4}.
     \]
   - Compute \( 6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \) and \( 5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14} \):
     \[
     6000^4 - 5000^4 = 6.71 \times 10^{14}.
     \]
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_{\text{total}} = \frac{0.4 \times 6.71 \times 10^{14}}{4 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.05177 \, \text{(or 5.17%)}.
     \]

5. **Exoplanet's Radius**:
   - The fractional brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_{\text{total}} = \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - Setting this equal to the spotted star's fractional change:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.05177.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_p / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     R_p / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.227.
     \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( R_p / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options directly.
   - The closest option is **D) ~0.32**, which corresponds to a fractional change of \( (0.32)^2 = 0.1 \) (or 10%). This discrepancy suggests the problem may be approximating the brightness variation without fully accounting for the temperature difference of the spots.

### Conclusion:
Given the options, the most reasonable choice is **D) ~0.32**, as it aligns with the assumption that the planet's radius produces a similar brightness variation to the spotted star, even though the exact calculation yields a slightly smaller value.

Answer: D
