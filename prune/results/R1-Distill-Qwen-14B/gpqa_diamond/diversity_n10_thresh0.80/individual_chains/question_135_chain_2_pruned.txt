Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I remember that bosons can decay into fermions, but the specifics are a bit fuzzy. Let me think this through.

The question gives a Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ_f \bar{ψ}_f f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that's a Yukawa-type interaction. The standard form for Yukawa is something like L = g \bar{ψ} ψ X, so this looks similar. So the coupling is proportional to λ_f times X, and it's acting on the fermion fields ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is about the allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. Decay here would mean X decaying into pairs of fermions.

The key thing here is to figure out which fermions are light enough such that the sum of their masses is less than the mass of X. Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the boson must be greater than twice the mass of each fermion involved. Or wait, each fermion in the pair must have mass less than half of X's mass, right? Because for each fermion, the rest mass would take up part of the energy.

So X can decay into a pair of fermions ff̄ if the sum of their rest masses is less than or equal to X's mass. Wait no, wait, each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to X's mass/2. Because in the rest frame of X, the maximum energy each fermion can have is when they are produced at rest, so each has mass at most m_X / 2.

Wait, but for each fermion, the maximum allowed mass is m_X/2. Because if each has mass m, then 2m ≤ m_X, so m ≤ m_X/2.

So knowing that, I need to figure out the masses of various fermions.

What's the mass of the top quark? Oh wait, the top quark is very heavy, around 173 GeV, way more than 6 GeV. So any decay into top quarks is impossible. So options that include t t̄ can be ruled out.

Looking at the options
