Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and which symmetries must be respected by all operators in it. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries.

The question gives four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. And the choices are combinations of these.

Wait, let's think. Effective theories like SMEFT are built by adding operators that don't violate the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model has several symmetries, including gauge symmetries (like SU(2), SU(3), U(1)), Lorentz symmetry, and others like CPT.

Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. All operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. Without that, the theory wouldn't make sense as a relativistic quantum field theory.

Poincare symmetry—that's the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations. Poincare symmetry includes things like momentum conservation and energy-momentum relation. Wait, but Lorentz symmetry is a part of Poincare. But in SMEFT, all operators have to be Lorentz-invariant, which is part of Poincare. So maybe Poincare is automatically satisfied if Lorentz is. Or do the SMEFT operators specifically have to respect Poincare? I think Poincare is a larger symmetry, so if you have Lorentz and translation invariance, you have Poincare. But operators in SMEFT are written in a way that their form is Lorentz-invariant, but does that imply Poincare? Or is Poincare a separate condition?

Wait, but the question asks which symmetries must be "respected" by the operators. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, and therefore, by extension, Poincare? Or maybe Poincare is automatically satisfied because the theory is built in a way that respects it. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about this point.

CP symmetry. Do SMEFT operators have to respect CP? I think that depends. The Standard Model itself doesn't require CP to be a symmetry, but in the SMEFT framework, operators are organized in terms of their CP properties. But wait, the question is whether operators must respect CP symmetry. I think not necessarily. Because the SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, but they are suppressed by higher-dimensional terms. For example, the SM doesn't have a strong CP symmetry, so the SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So, the operators don't have to individually respect CP symmetry. Therefore, CP is not a must-respected symmetry for all operators.

CPT symmetry. The SM (and therefore SMEFT) must respect CPT symmetry. Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially in theories with spin-½ particles. The SMEFT includes all possible operators that preserve the gauge symmetries and CPT. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

Putting it all together: Which symmetries must all operators respect? Let's go through each option.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Must be respected. So yes.
2. Poincare Symmetry: Hmm, I'm not sure. Since Lorentz is part of Poincare, but does that mean operators must respect Poincare? Or is Lorentz sufficient? I think Poincare includes translations, so SMEFT operators are written in a way that they are invariant under Poincare. So maybe yes, they must respect Poincare.

Wait, but does SMEFT require each operator to be Poincare-invariant? Or is it that the entire theory is Poincare-invariant, which includes the operators? If the operators are Lorentz-invariant and the theory includes translations, then I think each operator must be Poincare-invariant. Because each term in the Lagrangian must individually be Poincare-invariant for the entire theory to be. Wait, no, in QFT, the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant, but individual terms don't have to be; the sum must be. Wait, no, each term in the Lag
