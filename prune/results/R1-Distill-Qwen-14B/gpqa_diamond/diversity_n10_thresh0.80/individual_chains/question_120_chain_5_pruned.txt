Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Let me think through it step by step. I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. The bigger the parallax, the closer the star, right? Because parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by parallax (plx in arcseconds). So, if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsec, it's 1 parsec away. If it's 0.5 arcsec, that's 2 parsecs away.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, the number of stars in a certain range of parallax. Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Hmm, does that mean that their distances are uniform, so same density throughout space? Or uniform in some other way?

Wait, when they say uniformly distributed in the sky, I think they mean that the density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a given volume doesn't depend on where you are in that volume. So, if I imagine a spherical shell at a certain distance from the Earth, the number of stars in that shell would depend on the volume of the shell.

Oh, right, the number of stars in a thin shell depends on the volume of the shell and the density of stars. The volume of a thin spherical shell is about 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance from Earth) and dr is the thickness. So if the density is n stars per cubic parsec, then the number of stars in the shell is
