Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the given options.

The first reaction is: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. I remember that ketones reacting with CN- might form some kind of cyanohydrin. Oh right, the cyanohydrin reaction. So when a ketone reacts with cyanide, under certain conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin.

Wait, the cyanohydrin formation typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst. Because I think the reaction involves the attack of the nucleophilic cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon. The acid probably helps to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So the reagent A is likely an acid catalyst. But which one?

Looking at the options, the possible choices for A are H3O+ (which is a strong acid), NaHSO3, and others. Oh, wait, I think the cyanohydrin reaction is usually done with an acid like H2SO4 or H3O+ maybe. Because NaHSO3 is a sodium bisulfite, which is more commonly used in the reduction of ketones, like in the formation of alcohols from ketones via the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction uses a strong acid such as H3O+. So for step A, I'm thinking A could be H3O+.

Now, looking at the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group (-CN) is being hydrolyzed into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). But under what conditions does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed in acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, typically using H2SO4 and heat, or sometimes with a catalyst like HgSO4. But wait, another method is hydrolysis under basic conditions, like using NaOH and heat, followed by acid workup.

Wait, no, the reaction given just adds H2O and reagent B. So the reagent B is probably an acid catalyst. Or maybe it's a base. Let me think.

Wait, 2-hydroxybutanenitrile is in the starting material for the second reaction. So when a nitrile is hydrolyzed under certain conditions, it can form a carboxylic acid. So in the presence of water and acid, like HCl, or maybe another acid. Alternatively, maybe it's done with a base first, but the product is an acid.

Wait, the second reaction shows that the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So that's likely a hydrolysis reaction. For acidic hydrolysis, you typically use strong acid, like HCl. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another approach is that the nitrile first gets protonated, maybe in the presence of an acid, which makes it more electrophilic, allowing water to attack and add.

Alternatively, for basic conditions, you'd get a different pathway, but the product would be a carboxylate which would need acid workup. But the reaction given in the problem is using H2O and reagent B to get the carboxylic acid directly. So perhaps B is HCl, which provides the acidic condition for the hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait. The first reaction used A, which I thought was H3O+. Let's look at the options.

Options are:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So if for the first reaction, A is H3O+, then options A and B are possible for the first part. For the second reaction, reagent B, which is used in the hydrolysis, is either HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (option B and D) or something else.

Wait, another thought. The second reaction might involve the hydrolysis of a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. The typical reagents for this are either strong acid (like conc. H2SO4) or strong base with acid workup. But the problem says reagent B is H2O and another reagent. Hmm, maybe it's more about the workup.

Wait, perhaps in the second reaction, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. So the reagent B would be HCl, which provides the necessary acid for the hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe it's using a buffered aqueous solution with HCl as the catalyst.

Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis under basic conditions. Let me think: if the nitrile is treated with aqueous HCl, it would undergo hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid. Or, if it's treated with aqueous NaOH, you would form the carboxylate, which would require acid workup to get the acid.

But in the problem statement, reagent B is just H2O, and the other reagent is B. So perhaps the reagent B is an acid catalyst.

Wait, another approach: for the first reaction, butanone + NaCN and acid (H3O+). That would form the cyanohydrin, as the acid provides the H+ to protonate the carbonyl.

So for A, the correct reagent is H3O+; so options A or B.

Now, for the second reaction: the nitrile is in a molecule that also has a hydroxyl group. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, perhaps under acidic conditions, to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B would be an acid.

Looking at the options, if option A is HCl, that would make sense because HCl is a strong acid. So the second reaction uses HCl as the reagent, which provides the acidic environment for the hydrolysis.

Putting it together: A is H3O+ and B is HCl. So option A.

Wait, but looking back, what about the first reaction's reagent A? The reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So NaCN is the source of CN-.

In the cyanohydrin formation, the reaction is typically catalyzed by an acid. So yes, H3O+ is the likely catalyst, so A is H3O+.

So for the second reaction, the nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions, so reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. That would fit both reactions.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: perhaps the second reaction uses a different condition, like using H2O and an acid as the catalyst. So maybe the second reaction uses HCl as the acid. So that's what option A says.

So the correct answer would be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN-. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this purpose, ruling out NaHSO₃, which is not commonly used for cyanohydrin formation.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This hydrolysis typically occurs under acidic conditions, where HCl provides the necessary acidic environment for the reaction. While other acids like CH₃COOH could theoretically work, HCl is more commonly used for such hydrolysis reactions.

From the options:
- Option A (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl) satisfies both reactions: H₃O⁺ catalyzes the cyanohydrin formation, and HCl facilitates the nitrile hydrolysis.
- Option B (A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH) is less likely because CH₃COOH is not as strong or commonly used for nitrile hydrolysis.
- Options C and D (A = NaHSO₃) are unsuitable for the first reaction, as NaHSO₃ is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
