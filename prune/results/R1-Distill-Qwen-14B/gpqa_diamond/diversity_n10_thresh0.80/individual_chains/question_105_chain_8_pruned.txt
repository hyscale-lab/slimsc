Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface, one hemisphere, is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K, right?

The problem says that because of these spots, when the star rotates, the observed brightness changes periodically. This is similar to the brightness changes we see when a planet transits in front of a star, blocking some light. So the question is asking: if there were an exoplanet instead of these spots, what radius would the planet need to have to produce the same change in brightness, or the same amplitude in the light curve?

The options are choices for the ratio R_pl / R_star. Let's see, the options are around 0.07 to 0.39. So we're looking for a planet that's a small fraction of the star's size.

Hmm, wait. How does the brightness variation work in both cases? For a planet transit, the planet blocks a part of the star's light when it passes in front. The change in brightness is the area of the planet relative to the star. So the amplitude is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of radius.

But in this case, the spots are causing a variation. How does that work? The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the star's overall brightness decreases. But wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variation is similar to an exoplanet's effect. So the amplitude of the brightness dip would be due to the spots changing the total emitted flux.

Wait, so the star's brightness without any spots would be higher. The spots are cooler, so each spot contributes less light. So when a spot comes into view, the total flux decreases.

So the variation in brightness is due to the spots being on one hemisphere, and as the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into and out of view.

But the problem says the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. That suggests that the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to what a planet's transit would cause.

Wait, but in the case of the spots, the change in brightness is a dip when the spots are visible. The planet also causes a dip when it transits. So the amplitude of the dip is what's being compared.

So the key is to compute the fractional change in flux caused by the spots when the star is viewed from Earth, and set that equal to the fractional change caused by a planet transit.

So let's model this.

First, compute the total flux from the star when spots are present, and when they're not. Then, find the difference, which would give us the amplitude of the brightness variation.

Wait, but the star's brightness is modulated as the spots rotate. The maximum brightness would be when the spot hemisphere is facing away, and the minimum when it's facing towards us. Wait, no, because the spots are cooler, so when we see more spots
