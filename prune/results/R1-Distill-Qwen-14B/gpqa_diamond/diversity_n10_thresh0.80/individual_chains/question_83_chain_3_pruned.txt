Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. We start by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the titration should involve the neutralization reaction between CH3COOH and NaOH. Let me outline the steps I should take.

First, I think I need to calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. So the new volume is 40 cm³. Using M1V1 = M2V2, M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's compute the moles.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles.

Equivalence point: Moles of NaOH = 0.001. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, volume V = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, for the 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³. So, we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to the diluted acetic acid solution.

Let me think about the 25% point. At this point, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, I'll need to set up an ICE table for the reaction. 

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, the moles reacted are 0.00025. So, remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025.

Wait, but I should also consider the total volume now. The initial solution was 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³, so total is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, this is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). Let me calculate that. So, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, looking at the options, option D says 4.57; A is 4.26. Close to that.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me redo the ratio. 0.00025 / 0.0425 is 0.005882 M for acetate. 0.00075 / 0.0425 is 0.017647 for acetic acid. So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333. So log(0.3333) = -0.477.

So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26. Hmm, but option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the first part. Now, the second part is the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution. So, the pH should be higher than 7.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added are 10 cm³ * 0.1 M = 0.001 moles, which equals the initial 0.001 moles of acetic acid. So the solution now contains 0.001 moles of CH3COO^- in a total volume of 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M. Let me set up the expression.

Let x be the [OH^-] produced. Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so approximate denominator as 0.02.

x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² ≈ (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.983. So pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, but option D says the equivalence pH
