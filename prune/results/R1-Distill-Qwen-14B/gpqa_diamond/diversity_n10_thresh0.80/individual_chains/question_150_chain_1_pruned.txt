Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted with a set of reagents. I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The NMR shows peaks at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H).

Let me think about each peak:

- The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. A triplet around 9-10 ppm usually suggests an aldehyde proton (CHO), but wait, an aldehyde is usually around 9-10 and a singlet. But this is a triplet. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a phenol group? Or perhaps an amide? Hmm, but the molecular formula has an N and O, but no amide in the options. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So the molecule has one N and one O.

Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but if it's a triplet, maybe it's coupled with two neighboring protons. But an aldehyde in such a case? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone? No, because ketone protons are usually not in that region. Another possibility: an enol tautomer? Or perhaps it's an aromatic proton in a conjugated system. Wait, but 9.72 is quite upfield for an aromatic proton. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm.

Next, the peaks at 6.98 and 6.51, both doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical of para-substituted aromatic rings. For example, if there are two substituents on opposite positions of a benzene ring, like in para-substituted phenyl groups. The 6.98 might be the protons adjacent to the substituent, and 6.51 the protons opposite.

Then, 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals could be due to exchange with protons or maybe being in a conjugated system like an enol. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring that's more deshielded but not as much as the others. Wait, but 2H as a singletâ€”could it be part of a conjugated diene or something else?

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's in the range of CH2 groups, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a methylene next to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen.

Putting this together, let me think about possible structures. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2
