Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. Hmm, let me think through each part carefully.

The question presents four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. And there are four options, A to D. I need to determine which statement is correct based on these matrices.

First, I need to recall some quantum mechanics concepts. Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator is a unitary matrix. Also, when you exponentiate an anti-Hermitian matrix, you get a unitary matrix, which is used for time evolution.

So, let's break down each option.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm, for e^X to preserve the norm, X must be anti-Hermitian. Because if X is anti-Hermitian, then e^X is unitary, which preserves the norm. So if X is not anti-Hermitian, e^X might not be unitary, so the norm could change.

Let me check if X is anti-Hermitian. An anti-Hermitian matrix satisfies X† = -X. X is given as:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† would be the conjugate transpose. Let's compute that.

The first row of X† will be the conjugate of the first column of X. The first column of X is i, 1, 2i. Conjugate of i is -i, 1 stays 1, 2i becomes -2i. So first row of X† is [-i, 1, -2i].

Second row of X†: second column of X is -1, 0, -1. Conjugates: -1, 0, -1. So second row is [-1, 0, -1].

Wait wait, no. Wait, the columns of X are:

Column 1: [i, 1, 2i]
Column 2: [-1,0,-1]
Column 3: [2i, 1, -i]

So to get X†, we take the rows from the columns, and take the complex conjugate.

So X† is:
Row 1: (i)*, (-1)*, (2i)* → -i, -1, -2i
Wait, wait, no. Wait, first row of X† is the conjugate of the first column of X, which is [i,1,2i] → their conjugates are [-i,1,-2i].

Wait, wait, perhaps I should write out X and X† properly.

X is:

Row 1: i (1,1), -1 (1,2), 2i (1,3)
Row 2: 1 (2,1), 0 (2,2), 1 (2,3)
Row 3: 2i (3,1), -1 (3,2), -i (3,3)

So X† will be the transpose, with each element conjugated.

Transposing X gives:

Row 1: i, 1, 2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: 2i, 1, -i

Now, take the conjugate of each:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

So X† is:

[[-i, 1, -2i],
 [1, 0, 1],
 [-2i, -1, i]]

Now, let's see if X† equals -X. Let's compute -X.

-X would be negative of each element in X.

X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So -X:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Comparing X† and -X:

X† first row is [-i, 1, -2i] same as -X's first row.

X† second row is [1, 0, 1], while -X's second row is [-1,0,-1]. These are negatives of each other.

X† third row is [-2i, -1, i]. -X's third row is [-2i,1,i]. So third row, second element: X† has -1, -X has 1. So they are negatives. So overall, X† is equal to -X because each element in X† is the negative of the corresponding element in X.

Wait, wait. Let me check each element:

X† element (1,1): -i. -X (1,1): -i. So same.

(1,2): X† has 1; -X has 1. Same.

(1,3): X† has -2i; -X has -2i. Same.

(2,1): X† has 1; -X has -1. Different.

Oh wait, so they are not the same. Because in X† row 2 is [1, 0, 1], whereas in -X, row 2 is [-1, 0, -1]. So X† is not equal to -X.
