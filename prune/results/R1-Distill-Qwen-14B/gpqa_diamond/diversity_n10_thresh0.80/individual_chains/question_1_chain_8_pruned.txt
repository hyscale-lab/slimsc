Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty relation. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for this purpose, it's the order of magnitude that matters.

So the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. But wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if I have a certain uncertainty in time, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional. But in this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. So the lifetimes would relate to the uncertainty in time, right? Because the lifetime is the time during which the system is in that state, and the uncertainty in energy would be the minimum resolution needed to distinguish the two states.

Wait, so the problem is about being able to clearly distinguish two energy levels. That means the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states might appear the same due to the uncertainty.

So each state has its own lifetime. Which one do I use? The lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Hmm, the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) would have a larger energy uncertainty because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt. So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 would be about ħ/(1e-9). For E2, Δt is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is about ħ/(1e-8). But wait, since E2 has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller. So to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the actual energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each state's energy is uncertain within a range. For E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and for E2, it's ΔE2. To clearly distinguish E2 from E1, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Wait, no, because if the states are close in energy, their uncertainties might overlap. So the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, or maybe the sum. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The energy resolution needed is such that the two states don't overlap in their energy distributions. So the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. But which one? The longer-lived state has smaller ΔE. So perhaps the shorter-lived state's ΔE is bigger. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the larger ΔE, which is ΔE1.

Wait, let's compute the uncertainties. Let me recall that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe it's better to compute ΔE in eV.

Wait, how to convert? Let's see. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s would be ħ / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ (1.05e-34 J·s) / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ approx 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. For E1, Δt is 1e-9 s.

So ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, Δt is 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1e-8 s is larger than 1e-9 s, so ΔE2 should be smaller than ΔE1. Which matches the numbers above. So ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

So to distinguish E1 and E2, the energy difference between them must be greater than the maximum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is less than the sum, their ranges might overlap. Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the two uncertainties. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the energy resolution required is such that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of the shorter-lived state. Because the shorter-lived state has a larger uncertainty, so for the two to be distinguishable, their energies must be separated by more than that. Because if the difference is less than the larger uncertainty, then you can't tell them apart.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than ΔE1. Because E1 has a larger uncertainty. So the energy difference should be > 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options: let's compute each option in eV.

Option A) 1e-9 eV. That's 0.001 n eV. Way less than 6.58e-7 eV. So no.

Option B) 1e-11 eV. Even smaller. No.

Option C) 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV, which is way more than 6.58e-7 eV. So this would be sufficient.

Option D) 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV. Hmm, which is larger than ΔE2 (6.58e-8 eV), but smaller than ΔE1 (6.58e-7 eV). So if the energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is about 1.5 times smaller than ΔE1, so it's not enough to distinguish them.

Wait, because if the energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is
