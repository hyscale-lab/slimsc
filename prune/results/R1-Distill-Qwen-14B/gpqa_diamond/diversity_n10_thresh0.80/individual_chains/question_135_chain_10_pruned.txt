Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given its mass is 6 GeV. The Lagrangian is provided, but I'm not sure how much that affects the decay possibilities. Hmm.

Wait, the Lagrangian term is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, right, so this is an interaction term. The X field is interacting with fermions here. The fermion is ψ_f, and the interaction is with X. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so when it decays, the energy released must be enough to produce the fermion-antifermion pair.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion would need energy equal to its rest mass, right? So m_X ≥ 2m_f for the decay X → f f̄ to be allowed.

But wait, fermions come in different types. Like, quarks have different masses, same with leptons. So I need to list all possible fermions that have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV can be produced.

Let me recall the masses of the known fermions. Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But top is way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so way above 3. Bottom is about 4.5 GeV, which is above 3, so X can't decay into b b̄. So that's ruled out.

What about the others: up, down, strange, charm. Up and down are light, like a few MeV. Strange is around 95-100 MeV. Charm is about 1.5 GeV. So all of them are under 3 GeV. So X can decay into u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, the problem says "fermions" in general. So including leptons. So leptons are electrons, muons, taus, and the neutrinos. The tau is about 1.78 GeV, so half of that is around 0.89 GeV—so for X, which is 6 GeV, yes, 2*m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait, wait, no: 2*m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6? No, 3.56 is less than 6? Wait, 3.56 is less than 6? Oh, yes, 3.56 is less than 6. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

But wait, the tau is around 1.78 GeV, so two taus would be 3.56 GeV. 6 GeV is more than that, so decay is allowed.

Similarly for the other leptons: muon is about 0.1 GeV, so 2*0.1 is 0.2, way less than 6. Electron is even lighter.

Wait, but what about the neutrinos? They're massless for all practical purposes, so X could decay into ν ν̄, but I don't think that's an option here. Let me look at the options provided.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but I thought b is too heavy. Because 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass, 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So this includes c, which is okay because 2m_c is about 3 GeV. Wait, 2*1.5 GeV is 3 GeV, which is less than 6, so yes. So c is allowed. So option B includes c, which is correct.

Option C: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Hmm, t is top quark, which is way too heavy. X can’t decay into top. So option C is wrong because it includes t.

Option D: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, same as option A, includes b which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

Wait, let me double-check the fermion masses. Let me list the approximate masses:

- Up quark: ~2 MeV
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: ~95 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.1-4.7 GeV (so 4.7*2=9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV)
- Top quark: ~173 GeV
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: ~0 (but maybe we ignore them for decay products)

So for X (6 GeV) to decay into f f̄, m_f must be ≤3 GeV.

So possible fermions: u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So the decay products can be:

- u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e−, mu+ mu−, tau+ tau−.

So any of these.

Looking back at the options, option B includes c c̄, but option D includes b b̄ which is not allowed.

Wait, but what about the interaction term? The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ
