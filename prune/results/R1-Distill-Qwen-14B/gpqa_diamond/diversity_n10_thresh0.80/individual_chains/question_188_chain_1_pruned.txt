Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, what do I remember about rhombohedral structures? Oh right, it's one of the crystal systems, right? So the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a three-dimensional figure where all edges are equal and all angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance—oh yeah, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 cos^2 α + k^2 cos^2 β + l^2 cos^2 γ) + 2 h k cos α cos β cos γ ) ), but wait, maybe that's for a general hexagonal or something? Or was it more specific to rhombohedral?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, no, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, I've heard that for a rhombohedral system, there's a simplified formula because all the a, b, c are equal, and all angles are equal. Because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c and α = β = γ. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Let me think. The interplanar distance formula in a general crystal system is usually expressed as:

d^2 = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a^2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) ) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of Miller indices. Oh wait, the general formula for interplanar distance is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but wait, in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so cos of those is zero, which simplifies the formula. But in this rhombohedral case, the angles are 30 degrees, so cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866.

Wait, but in rhombohedral, a
