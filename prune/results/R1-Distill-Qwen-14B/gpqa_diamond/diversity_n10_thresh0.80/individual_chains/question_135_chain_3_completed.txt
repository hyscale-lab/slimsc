Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's take it slow.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is a Yukawa interaction term, which typically describes the interaction between a boson and fermions. The boson here is X, and the fermions are ψ_f, which probably stands for various fermion types like quarks or leptons.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So the question is about the allowed decay products of X based on the interactions provided.

First, I need to think about what particles X can decay into. Since the interaction term involves the fermion fields ψ_f, the boson X can couple to these fermions. So, X can mediate processes where it is produced or destroyed along with these fermions.

Looking at the interaction term, it's something like X ψ ψ, right? Because the term is -λ f ψ̄ (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). So this is a Yukawa coupling, which usually allows for processes where the boson X is exchanged between two fermions.

Now, in terms of decay, the boson X can decay into a pair of fermions. The possible decay modes are determined by the available fermion species and the energy (mass) of X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that can be produced must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because in decay processes, the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

Let me list the possible fermions. The fermions are quarks and leptons. The quarks come in different flavors: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But wait, top quarks are super heavy, like around 173 GeV, so if X is only 6 GeV, it can't decay into top quarks.

Looking at other quarks:
- Up quark: very light, practically negligible mass.
- Down quark: same as up, about a few MeV.
- Strange quark: mass around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV).
- Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark: around 4.5 GeV.
- Top quark: way too heavy.

So for quarks, the possible decay products would be pairs where each quark's mass is less than 3 GeV (since each gets half, but wait, actually, for a pair, the sum must be less than X's mass).

Wait, no, because in the decay, the two fermions (like a quark and antiquark) must each have a mass such that their combined rest mass is less than X's mass. So 2m_fermion <= m_X.

Wait, no. Because in the rest frame of X, the two fermions can have some kinetic energy, but the minimal case is when they are produced at rest, meaning 2m_fermion <= m_X.

So for each fermion species, 2m_f <=6 GeV → m_f <=3 GeV.

Let me check the masses:

- Up: ~2 MeV → definitely allowed.
- Down: ~4-5 MeV → allowed.
- Strange: ~95 MeV → allowed.
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV → 1.5 <3 → allowed.
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → not allowed.

So quark pairs allowed for decay of X are up, down, strange, and charm.

Wait, but wait—some quarks are not really accessible? Because for each quark, you need to have a pair, like uū or dđ, etc.

But also, the interaction term involves ψ_f, which are the left-handed Weyl fermions (I think), but in the Standard Model, the Yukawa couplings are for the left-handed fields. But in the decay, the fermions would be in their mass eigenstates, which are combinations of left- and right-handed fields.

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Let me focus on the masses of the particles. So any fermion pair with a combined mass less than 6 GeV is allowed.

Wait, but the fermion itself has a mass. So each fermion in the pair contributes m_f, so the sum is 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV. But wait, each fermion in the pair would have a mass. So for quarks:

- u and d: their masses are negligible, so 2m would be way below 6 GeV. So they can definitely be decay products.

- s: same, 2m_s is about 0.2 GeV, so allowed.

- c: 2m_c is about 3 GeV. So m_c is about 1.5 GeV, so 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

- b: 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks.

So quark decay channels allowed are u, d, s, c.

Now, what about leptons? The interaction term includes fermions with charge, so the fermions could be charged leptons as well. Because the Lagrangian has ψ_f, which could be leptons.

For leptons: possible decay products are charged leptons and their antiparticles. The possible pairs are e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, etc.

But again, their masses must satisfy 2m_lepton ≤ m_X.

Electron mass is about 0.0005 GeV. So 2m_e is negligible. So e+ e- is allowed.

Same for muon: m_mu is about 0.1 GeV. So 2m_mu is about 0.2 GeV, allowed.

Tau lepton: m_tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau+ tau- is allowed.

So possible lepton decay channels are e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

But wait, can X decay into neutrinos? Because the interaction term involves fermion fields, but neutrinos are leptons too. But in the Standard Model, neutrinos are left-handed and only interact via the weak force, but in this case, if the interaction is via a Yukawa coupling, would the neutrino be involved? Hmm.

Wait, the Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, perhaps I should parse that correctly.

Wait, the term is -λ f ψ̄_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), because (υ + X(y)) would be scalar, but I'm not sure. Oh, wait, the interaction term is written as (υ + X(y)) as the scalar field. So the interaction term is proportional to X(y) ψ̄ ψ.

Wait, but in the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a doublet, so when you expand it, you get terms that couple to fermions. But in this case, the interaction is written as X times ψ̄ ψ, so X is a boson here.

Wait, perhaps in this model, X is a scalar boson, and the interaction is a Yukawa coupling. So this would allow X to decay into a pair of fermions, as long as the fermions have a mass and the coupling exists.

So, for each fermion species that X can couple to, and the pair's mass is less than X's mass, the decay is allowed.

So, the possible decay products of X would be all possible fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_fermion ≤6 GeV.

So let's check the fermions:

Quarks:

- u: m ~ 2 MeV → allowed.

- d: similar, allowed.

- s: ~95 MeV → allowed.

- c: ~1.5 GeV → 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6 → allowed.

- b: ~4.5 GeV → 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 → not allowed.

- t: way too heavy, not allowed.

Leptons:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → allowed.

- mu: 0.1 GeV → allowed.

- tau: ~1.78 GeV → 2*1.78=~3.56 GeV ≤6 → allowed.

- Neutrinos: their masses are negligible, but in the Standard Model, neutrinos are left-handed, and only interact via the weak force. So if the interaction term involves ψ_f (the left-handed fields), then X can decay into neutrinos as well. But wait, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are massless, but even if they had mass, the decay would require that 2m_nu ≤ m_X.

But wait, the interaction term is -λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f. So if ψ_f is a left-handed Weyl spinor, then the right-handed component is another field. So the Yukawa coupling would need to involve both left- and right-handed fields to give a mass term, but the given interaction seems to be a Yukawa term for a mass, which would require both left and right-handed components.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So regardless of the specific, the fermions that are involved in the interaction can be decay products.

So, the decay products would be any possible pairs where the fermion's mass is such that 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So, for the options given:

Looking at the options, A is X → b bbar etc. But wait, for b quarks, 2m_b is ~9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV, so X cannot decay into b quarks.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Includes b bbar. So X can't decay into b's, so A is incorrect.

Option B) Has c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau pairs, mu pairs, e pairs. So that includes everything except the bottom quark. Because c is 1.5 GeV, 2*c is 3 GeV ≤6. So possible.

Option C) Also includes t tbar, but t is way too heavy (173 GeV), so that's impossible. So C is incorrect.

Option D) Includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

So the correct options are B, because it includes all the allowed fermion pairs except the bottom quark and top quark.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recheck. The options are:

A) X→b, s, u, d, tau, e.

But X can't decay into b's because 2m_b is ~9 GeV >6 GeV. So A is wrong.

B) X→c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. These are all allowed. So B is a possibility.

C) Includes t. Not allowed, so C is out.

D) Includes b and others. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait again. What about the charged leptons? Are they allowed? Because the interaction term involves ψ_f, which could be charged leptons. For example, if ψ_f is the electron field, then X can decay into e+ e-.

So, the allowed decay channels are:

Quark pairs: u, d, s, c.

Lepton pairs: e+, e-; mu+ mu-; tau+ tau-.

Wait, but what about the charged leptons? Because the interaction term is written as ψ_f, which could be charged. So the decay would produce charged leptons. So yes, those are allowed.

So in option B, the decay modes are:

c cbar: allowed.

s sbar: allowed.

u ubar: allowed.

d dbar: allowed.

tau+ tau-: allowed.

mu+ mu-: allowed.

e+ e-: allowed.

So option B has all these.

Looking back at the options, option B is:

B) X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term describes a Yukawa coupling between the boson \( X \) and fermions, allowing \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The decay products must satisfy the condition that the combined rest mass of the pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Quark Decay Channels**:
   - **Up (\( u \)) and Down (\( d \)) Quarks**: Their masses are negligible, so \( 2m_u \) and \( 2m_d \) are much less than 6 GeV. These decays are allowed.
   - **Strange (\( s \)) Quark**: The mass of the strange quark is approximately 95 MeV, so \( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.
   - **Charm (\( c \)) Quark**: The mass of the charm quark is approximately 1.5 GeV, so \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.
   - **Bottom (\( b \)) Quark**: The mass of the bottom quark is approximately 4.5 GeV, so \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which exceeds 6 GeV. This decay is not allowed.
   - **Top (\( t \)) Quark**: The top quark is much heavier (173 GeV), so this decay is not allowed.

2. **Lepton Decay Channels**:
   - **Electron (\( e \))**: The mass of the electron is approximately 0.0005 GeV, so \( 2m_e \) is negligible, and this decay is allowed.
   - **Muon (\( \mu \))**: The mass of the muon is approximately 0.1 GeV, so \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.
   - **Tau (\( \tau \))**: The mass of the tau is approximately 1.78 GeV, so \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.

3. **Neutrinos**: Neutrinos have negligible mass, but the interaction term involves charged fermions (\( \psi_f \)), so neutrinos are not included in the decay products.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \). All these decays are allowed, as their combined masses are less than 6 GeV. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark is too heavy (\( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)). This option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decay modes of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
