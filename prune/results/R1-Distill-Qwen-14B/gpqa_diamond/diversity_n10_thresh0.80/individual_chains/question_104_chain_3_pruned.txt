Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through this.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same masses as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets, given the shifts in their spectral lines.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but wait, how does the shift relate to the orbital period?

I remember the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves towards and away from us because the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the larger the velocity of the star. But how does that relate to the orbital period?

Oh, right, the velocity of the star is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. There's this formula: the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1/(P^(1/3))). Wait, I'm not sure, maybe I should think about the more precise formula.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_p + M_star)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e^2)^(0.5))) )

Wait, but since M_p is much smaller than M_star (because M_p is Neptune mass, and M_star is solar mass), M_p + M_star ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude, which is:

K = (v) = ( ( (2π G ) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G / (P c^3)) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing terms. Another approach: the RV method's K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The relation might be that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P) ^ (-1/3). Because higher mass planet would cause a larger K, and a shorter orbital period (closer in) would cause a higher K since the star is moving faster in its orbit.

Wait wait, let's think about Kepler's third law. For a star and planet system, the period P is given by:

P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) ) * a³

But since M_planet << M_star, it's approximately:

P² = (4π²/(G M_star)) a³

So a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4 π²)

Now, the velocity of the star (K) in the radial velocity method is related to the orbital speed of the star. The star's velocity is much smaller than the planet's, but the two are related because the star's velocity is (M_p / M_star) times the planet's velocity.

Wait, because in the two-body problem, the star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass. So the star's orbit has radius a_star = (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) ) * a_planet. Since M_p is much smaller, a_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) a_planet.

The orbital speed of the star (v_star) is 2π a_star / P.

So v_star = 2π a_star / P = 2π (M_p a_planet) / (M_star P)

But from Kepler's law, a_planet³ = (G (M_star + M_p) P² ) / (4 π²) ≈ (G M_star P² ) / (4 π² )

So a_planet = [ (G M_star P² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Substitute this into v_star:

v_star = 2π (M_p / M_star) * [ (G M_star P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 ) / P

Simplify:

Let me write this as:

v_star = (2 π M_p / M_star) * [ (G M_star P² )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 ) / P

Let's compute [ (G M_star P² )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ G^(1) M_star^(1) P^(2) ]^(1/3 ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

= G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

So substituting back:

v_star = (2 π M_p / M_star) * [ G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] / P

Simplify denominator:

Denominator is 4 π²^(1/3) = (4)^(1/3) (π)^(2/3)

So now:

v_star = (2 π M_p ) / M_star * [ G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ] / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) * 1/P

Wait, the denominator is 4^(1/3) π^(2/3), and we have the division by P.

So let's group all terms:

v_star = (2 π M_p ) / M_star * [ G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ] / [4^(1/3) π^(2/3) P ]

Combine the P terms:

P^(2/3) / P = P^(-1/3)

Combine the M_star terms:

M_p / M_star * M_star^(1/3) = M_p * M_star^(-2/3)

So now:

v_star = 2 π M_p * G^(1/3) / [4^(1/3) π^(2/3) M_star^(2/3) ] * P^(-1/3 )

Now, 2 / 4^(1/3) is equal to 2 / (2^(2/3)) ) because 4=2², so 4^(1/3) = 2^(2/3).

2 / 2^(2/3 ) = 2^(1 - 2/3 ) = 2^(1/3).

Similarly, π / π^(2/3) = π^(1 - 2/3 ) = π^(1/3).

So putting that together:

v_star = (2^(1/3) ) * (π^(1/3)) ) * M_p * G^(1/3) / M_star^(2/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Wait, perhaps I can write that as:

v_star = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but perhaps I can write it as:

v_star = [ (2 π G ) / (P c^3) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting too tangled up. Let me think about the proportionality.

We have K (the semi-amplitude) proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, since from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the exact proportionality, but I think the key point is that the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, and directly proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the star's mass to some power.

But in this problem, the two stars are identical, same mass as the Sun. So M_star is the same for both.

So, for the same M_p (both planets have same mass as Neptune), the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Because K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7, then K2 = (7/5) K1.

Since K ∝ (1/P^(1/3) ), then (K1 / K2 ) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But K1 is 5, K2 is7.

Wait, no, the problem says that Planet #1's spectral line shift is 5 milli, and Planet #2's is7. So K1 is 5, K2 is7.

Wait, no, no, wait, the problem says: the shift for planet 1 is 5 milli, and for planet 2, it's7. So in terms of K, K1 is 5, K2 is7, so K1 < K2.

But from the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K implies shorter period.

Because if K is larger, the star's velocity is larger, which implies a
