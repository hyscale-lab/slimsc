Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES at Keck can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So the star's apparent magnitude must be below (brighter than) 17 for ESPRESSO and below 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter. So for a star to be detected, it needs to have apparent V mag brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO (so apparent mag ≤17? Or is it brighter than 17? The question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed", which would mean apparent mag <17? Because stars with higher magnitudes are fainter. So if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is less than 17. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so app mag ≤16. So a star must have app mag ≤16 to be detected by HIRES, but can have up to 17 for ESPRESSO.

So the star must be bright enough to be within both limits. Wait no, because HIRES can see brighter (down to lower magnitudes) than ESPRESSO. So the star must be bright enough that its apparent magnitude is ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be within both. So the maximum apparent magnitude it can have is 16 because that's what HIRES requires. If a star is 17, it's too faint for HIRES.

But wait, wait. The question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16 (for HIRES) and ≤17 (for ESPRESSO). So it's sufficient that the star's app mag is ≤16, because then it would be within ESPRESSO's limit too.

So now, I need to compute the apparent V magnitude of each star.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent mag is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). d
