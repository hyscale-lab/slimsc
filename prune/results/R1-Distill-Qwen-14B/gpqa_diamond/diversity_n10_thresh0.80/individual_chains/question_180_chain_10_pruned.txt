Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything related to that. Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, so first, I remember that the energy in such systems is usually electrostatic potential energy because the charges are either fixed or constrained. Since the system is isolated, we can ignore external fields, so all the energy comes from the interactions between the charges themselves.

I think the formula for the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant. But wait, when multiple charges are involved, I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair of charges and then sum them all up.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge (which is fixed). Also, those 12 charges are at the same distance from P, but I don't know how they are arranged relative to each other. Oh, wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So maybe they are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m, centered at P. But since they are identical and the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, perhaps the potential energy comes only from their interactions with the fixed charge at P, and among themselves.

But wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. So, maybe the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the total potential energy. But wait, for identical charges, the potential energy is always positive because same charges repel, so the minimum energy would be the configuration where repulsion is minimized. Wait, no. Wait, no, for a fixed charge, the other charges have to be placed in positions where they have the least repulsion, perhaps meaning the least potential energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I need to consider their mutual interactions.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps I should compute the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and also the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. But wait, if the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, their positions relative to each other could be arranged in a way that minimizes the total energy. But without knowing their exact arrangement, it's tricky. Or maybe the problem doesn't require considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, perhaps because they're considered as fixed in their positions, so their mutual potential energy is fixed. Hmm.

Wait, let me read the problem again. "12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So the 12 are all at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. But
