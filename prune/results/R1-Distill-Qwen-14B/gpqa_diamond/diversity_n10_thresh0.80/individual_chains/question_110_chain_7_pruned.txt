Alright, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let's break down the information given.

First, I remember that both instruments have different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 mag, while HIRES can go down to V=16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag (since that's the higher limit) can be seen by both because if a star is brighter than 17, it's definitely brighter than 16. But wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, no. Because HIRES can only go down to 16. If a star is brighter than 17, it's fainter than 17, but wait, no, magnitude scale is the opposite. Brighter objects have lower magnitudes. So lower numbers are brighter.

So, for a star to be observable by both, it has to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, but since HIRES can go down to 16, which is brighter than 17. Wait, no. Wait, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17 mag. So it can handle stars with V mag less than or equal to 17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. Wait, no, the statement says "brighter than 17 mag". So if a star has V mag less than 17, it's brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤17.

Wait, let me clarify. The question says: For ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. So apparent V magnitude (m) < 17? Because brighter means lower magnitude. So m < 17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So m < 16.

So for a star to be observable by both, it must have m < 16. Because if m is <16, it's acceptable by both. If m is between 16 and 17, then it can be seen by ESPRESSO (since m <17) but not by HIRES (since m >=16 is not allowed). So only stars with m ≤15 can be detected with both.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's see:

- ESPRESSO: m <17 → can observe down to m=17 (brighter than 17 mag). So any star with m <17.

- HIRES: m <16 → can observe down to m=16.

So the overlap is m <16. Because if a star is m=15, both can detect it. If it's m=16.5, ESPRESSO can detect it but HIRES cannot. So the star must have an apparent V magnitude less than 16.

Now, let's look at each star and compute their apparent V magnitudes. Wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes, others have apparent. So I'll need to compute apparent magnitude where necessary.

The formula to find apparent magnitude is:

m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d)

Where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in
