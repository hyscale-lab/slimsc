Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubits space. Hmm. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (i.e., a statistical mixture of pure states).

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! When a density matrix is a completely mixed state, like this one, it's often represented as the maximally mixed state. For a single qubit, the maximally mixed state is (I + something)/d, where d is the dimension. But wait, for a single qubit, d=2, so I think it's (I)/2? Because I is the identity matrix, which is 2x2.

So let's think about the structure of ρ. Each term |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors. The identity matrix I for a 2x2 system is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So when we take (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|), that's exactly the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I, right? Because each of those projectors adds up to the identity.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I think density matrices can be represented as points in a 3-dimensional space, using the Bloch sphere representation. Wait, but Bloch spheres are for pure states, right? Because pure states are like vectors on the surface of the sphere. For mixed states, the Bloch vector is inside the sphere.

The Bloch vector is usually written as r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector and the identity matrix: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, so in this case, our ρ is (I)/2. Let me see. Comparing the two expressions: (I + r·σ)/2 equals (I)/2. That would imply that r·σ must be zero. Each component of r times the corresponding Pauli matrix adds up to zero. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz.

So r·σ = r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. For this to be zero, each component r_x, r_y, r_z must be zero. Because each Pauli matrix is independent in their components. So r_x = 0, r_y=0, r_z=0. Therefore, the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). That makes sense because the maximally mixed state is in the center of the Bloch sphere, not on the surface. So the position is the origin.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't get anything confused. The maximally mixed state has equal probabilities for both |0⟩ and |1⟩, and no coherence. So it's as if it's an ensemble of 50% |0⟩ and 50% |1⟩. So all the coherences (the off-diagonal terms) in the density matrix are zero. Let me write out the matrix.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) = (1/2)[[1,0],[0,1]] which is the same as the identity matrix divided by 2. So ρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So when you express ρ as (I + r·σ)/2, since I is [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the same as 2ρ. So I + r·σ = 2*(1/2 I) * 2? Wait, maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, the standard form is ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz ) / 2. Since our ρ is (I)/2, that means the coefficients of σx, σy, σz are all zero. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. Therefore, the vector r is (0,0,0).

Yes, that confirms it. So the correct option is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The maximally mixed state can be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In terms of the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies that \(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is at the origin, \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

This corresponds to the maximally mixed state being located at the center of the Bloch sphere, as it has no coherence or preference for either the \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) state.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
