Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's asking.

The state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors can be expressed in terms of basis states. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, these might be the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

Wait, the question says |alpha> is proportional to that combination, so I guess I need to normalize it because right now, it's just proportional, not a normalized state. That's the first step, I think. So I'll compute the normalization factor.

Let me write down the state vector. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. The normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients must equal 1.

So the magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. The magnitude squared of (2-i) is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about another operator whose matrix representation A_ij is given. The elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so that's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with two basis states.

Let me think about what operator that would be. The standard Pauli matrices have different forms, but this A matrix seems to have off-diagonal elements as hbar/2 and zeros on the diagonal. So the matrix A is:

[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2   0]

Wait, wait. If i is not equal to j, A_ij is hbar/2, else 0. So yeah, that's correct. So the operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so scaling that by hbar/2 gives the A matrix.

So the operator is (hbar/2) σ_x.

The question asks for two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator, and the average value of the operator.

Wait, but wait. The eigenstates of A are what? Since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, its eigenstates would be the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, scaled by hbar/2.

So, the eigenstates of A are:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2),

with eigenvalues (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), respectively.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates. The probability will be the square of the amplitude for each eigenstate.

Alternatively, I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Wait, another approach: since the operator A has eigenstates |+> and |->, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude when |alpha> is projected onto the corresponding eigenstate.

So, let's compute < + | alpha > and < - | alpha >.

First, let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

The eigenstate |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, compute < + | alpha >:

= [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * [1/sqrt(2)] + [ (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * [1/sqrt(2)].

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The inner product < + | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | + < down | ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Because < up | up> is 1, < up | down> is 0, and same for the others. Wait, no, wait. The < + | is ( < up | + < down | )/sqrt(2). So when you multiply by |alpha>, you get:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i)(1+i) + (2 + i)(2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it step by step.

Compute < + | alpha >:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ]

Because < + | up> is 1/sqrt(2), and < + | down> is 1/sqrt(2), so each term is (coefficient of |up> * 1/sqrt(2) ) + (coefficient of |down> * 1/sqrt(2) ).

So combining, (1 - i + 2 + i ) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Wait, numerator: (1+i) coefficient is (1 - i) when taking complex conjugate? Wait, no. Wait, the coefficient is (1 + i) for |up>, so when you take the inner product, it's (1 - i) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2) from < + | up>.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute each component.

The inner product < + | alpha > is equal to (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 + i)*1/(sqrt(7)) + (2 - i)*1/(sqrt(7)) ]

Wait, no. Because | + > is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so when you take the inner product with |alpha>, you get:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) )

Which simplifies to [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Adding the numerators: 1+2 =3, i -i =0. So numerator is 3.

So < + | alpha > = 3/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute < - | alpha >.

|-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < - | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (-1) ]

= (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ]

= [ (1 + i -2 +i) ] / ( sqrt(14) )

Simplify numerator: (1-2) = -1, (i +i) = 2i. So numerator is (-1 + 2i).

So < - | alpha > = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Now, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these inner products.

Compute |< + | alpha >|^2: (3)^2 / (14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.64286. But looking at the options, none of the probabilities have 9/14, which is approximately 0.64. Let me check the options.

Option A: 0.64 and 0.36. 0.64 is close to 9/14 (which is ~0.6428). 0.36 is 9/25=0.36, but 14-9=5, so 5/14≈0.357. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. But 9/14 is 0.6428, and 5/14 is ~0.357. So the probabilities would be 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the squared magnitude of < - | alpha >.

The inner product is (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.357), which are the probabilities of measuring the + and - eigenvalues, respectively.

Wait, but the operator's eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, since the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x, and σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So when you measure, the possible outcomes are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, respectively.

Wait, but the question says, "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator". So maybe they're referring to the probabilities of the two possible eigenstates |+> and |->. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. So in the options, looking for 9/14 approx 0.64 and 5/14 approx 0.357.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. That's close to 9/14≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357. So 0.64 and 0.36 are rounded.

So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the second part is the average value of the operator. The expectation value <A> is the sum of each eigenvalue multiplied by its probability.

The eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2, with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14.

So <A> = (hbar/2)*(9/14) + (-hbar/2)*(5/14) = [ (9 -5)hbar ]/(28) ) = (4 hbar)/(28) ) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average is hbar/7. That matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the average value calculation.

Alternatively, remember that the expectation value can be computed as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, and σ_x is a Hermitian operator, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in the |alpha> state.

The expectation value of σ_x is <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

But σ_x in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So perhaps a faster way is to represent |alpha> as a vector and compute the expectation value.

But perhaps that's more time-consuming, but let's try.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So the density matrix is |alpha><alpha|.

The expectation value is Tr( A rho ), where rho is |alpha><alpha|.

But A is (hbar/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], so the matrix product would be:

A rho = (hbar/2) [ [0,1],[1,0] ] * [ [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ], [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] ]

Wait, because |alpha> is a column vector [a, b]^T, then rho is [a a* , a b*; b a* , b b* ]

So a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7), b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So rho is:

[ (1-i)(1+i)/(7), (1-i)(2-i)/(7) ]

[ (2+i)(1+i)/(7), (2+i)(2-i)/(7) ]

Wait, let me compute each element:

rho_11 = |a|^2 = (1+i)(1-i)/7 = (1 +1)/7 = 2/7.

rho_12 = a b* = (1+i)(2 +i)/7.

Compute (1+i)(2 +i) = 2 +i + 2i +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So rho_12 = (1 +3i)/7.

Similarly, rho_21 = b a* = (2 -i)(1 -i)/7.

(2 -i)(1 -i) = 2(1) -2i -i(1) + i^2 = 2 -3i -1= 1 -3i.

So rho_21 = (1 -3i)/7.

rho_22 = |b|^2 = (2 -i)(2 +i)/7 = (4 +2i -2i +1)/7 =5/7.

Now, A is (hbar/2) [[0,1],[1,0]].

So A rho is (hbar/2) times:

[ [0*rho_11 +1*rho_21, ... ],
  [1*rho_11 + 0*rho_21, ... ] ]

Wait, no, matrix multiplication for A rho:

First row of A: [0, 1], multiplied by columns of rho.

So first element (1,1) of A rho is 0*rho_11 + 1*rho_21 = rho_21.

Similarly, (1,2) is 0*rho_12 +1*rho_22 = rho_22.

Second row of A: [1, 0]

(2,1) = 1*rho_11 + 0*rho_21 = rho_11.

(2,2) = 1*rho_12 + 0*rho_22 = rho_12.

So A rho = (hbar/2) * [ [ rho_21, rho_22 ], [ rho_11, rho_12 ] ]

Thus, the trace is (hbar/2) [ rho_21 + rho_12 ].

Compute rho_21 + rho_12.

rho_21 = (1 -3i)/7.

rho_12 = (1 +3i)/7.

Sum: [1 -3i +1 +3i ] /7 = (2)/7.

So trace is (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7. So yes, the average value is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357), and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. That matches.

Option D says 0.61 and 0.29, which averages to about 0.4, which doesn't fit with our 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The state must first be normalized. The coefficients of |up⟩ and |down⟩ are (1+i) and (2-i), respectively. The normalization factor is determined by the total squared magnitude of the coefficients, which is:

\[
|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩.
\]

The operator in question has a matrix representation \( A_{ij} \), where \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to the operator:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x,
\]

where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), given by:

\[
|+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |−⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩),
\]

with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of \( A \), the state |α⟩ is projected onto |+⟩ and |−⟩. The inner products are:

\[
⟨+|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]

\[
⟨−|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these inner products:

\[
P(+⟩) = \left| ⟨+|α⟩ \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad P(−⟩) = \left| ⟨−|α⟩ \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

The average value of the operator \( A \) is given by the expectation value \( ⟨α|A|α⟩ \). Using the eigenvalues and their probabilities:

\[
⟨A⟩ = \left(+\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)P(+⟩) + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)P(−⟩) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(\frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), average value \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches the results.
- **Option B**: Incorrect average value.
- **Option C**: Incorrect probabilities and average value.
- **Option D**: Incorrect probabilities and average value.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
