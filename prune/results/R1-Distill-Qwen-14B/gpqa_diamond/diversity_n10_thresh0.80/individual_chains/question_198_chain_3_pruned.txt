Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that there's a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it's harder to dissociate. The complexes here are probably different forms of Co(SCN)_n^2−n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached.

The colors mentioned are blue, which I think refers to the specific complex. I recall that the different Co(SCN)_n complexes have different colors: [Co(SCN)]^2+ is blue, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is maybe another color, and so on. Wait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2-? Or wait, maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) because the charge would be neutral if each SCN is -1 and two of them would be -2, but Co is +2, so 2-2=0. So that complex is neutral.

So, the question is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] in the solution. All the cobalt species include all possible complexes from n=0 to n=4, I think. Because the stability constants go up to n=4.

Wait, but wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think: for a metal ion M, the complex [M(L)_n] would have a formation constant β_n = [ML_n]/([M][L]^n). So, if β1 is 9, that's for the first complex, which is ML. So [Co(SCN)]^2+ would have β1=9. Then β2=40 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, I think. Similarly, β3 is for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and β4 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands. So, the complex [Co(SCN)_2] would be the one with n=2. So in this case, we're looking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (since the charge would be 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0) in the solution.

So,
