Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and the question is about finding the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think through this.

Wait, Li is lithium. So, Li with 3 neutrons would be Li-6, right? Because lithium usually has 3 protons, and adding 3 neutrons makes it 6 nucleons total. So, the nucleus is Li-6.

I need to find the total energy of each nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I think the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I'll calculate gamma first.

Let me plug in v = 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is... let me calculate that. 0.28^2 is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Then gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, I think it's exactly 35/10 divided by 28/100, or wait, 0.28 is 28/100. So 1/(28/100) is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

So gamma is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the energy E is gamma times m0 c squared. But wait, what is m0 here? It's the rest mass of the nucleus. So for Li-6, what's the mass?

I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the atomic mass. Li-6 has an atomic number of 3 (protons) and mass number 6 (total nucleons). The molar mass is about 6 g/mol for Li-6. Wait, but more accurately, the atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 atomic mass units (u), but wait wait, Li-6 is an isotope. The exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units, I think.

Wait, wait, better to double-check. The standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but Li-6 is an isotope. Its exact mass is about 6.015 u. Because each proton is about 1 u, and neutrons are about 1.008 u. Let me compute it more accurately.

Li-6
