Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it. Hmm, the question says that there's a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They give me their masses, the bond length, and the angular frequency. I need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when it's in the fundamental state.

Wait, the fundamental state—oh right, that's the lowest energy state. So the molecule is currently in its ground state, and a photon is absorbed, causing it to transition to the next state. But wait, the question mentions the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, I think that refers to the next higher energy level. So, I need to find the energy difference between the ground state and the next state, and then relate that to the photon's momentum.

But wait, photons have energy E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency. And momentum p is related to energy by E = pc, since for photons, energy and momentum are related as E=pc because their mass is zero. So if I can find the energy difference, I can find the momentum.

Wait, but what's the energy difference here? The molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so it's a combination of rotational and vibrational energy. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The molecule has a vibrational ground state and rotational states. The fundamental vibrational state is the lowest vibrational state, n=0. When a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition either to a higher vibrational state, or a higher rotational state, or both. But the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, so that's the lowest possible vibrational state, and I'm guessing we're considering the next energy state, which could be the first excited state.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, maybe that's the next higher energy state, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational transitions. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait no, maybe the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next possible state, which would probably be the next vibrational or rotational level. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diatomic in the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximation. So the total energy would be the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but when the molecule is in its fundamental state, that would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next possible state would be the next higher energy state, which could be either increasing J (rotational) or v (vibrational).

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the photon is causing a transition that requires the least possible energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the model is such that the next state would be a higher vibration state, if that's lower in energy than a higher rotational state. No, wait, higher vibrational states have higher energy than higher rotational states, depending on the constants. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both rotation and vibration change, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about the energy levels. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in quantum models are given by:

E_total = E_rot + E_vib

E_rot is the rotational energy: E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia, J is the rotational quantum number.

E_vib is the vibrational energy: E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w n, where n is the vibrational quantum number (n=0,1,2...).

So in the fundamental state, n=0, J=0. The next state could be either n=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). Which one requires less energy?

Let me calculate the energy differences for both.

First, the rotational energy when J=0 is E_rot = 0. For J=1, E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * (1)(2) = (ħ² * 2)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

The vibrational energy when n=0 is E_vib = (1/2) h w. So when n=1, E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w = (3/2) h w.

So the energy difference when transitioning to J=1 is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = ħ²/(I).

The energy difference for vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 is (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w.

So which is smaller, h w or ħ²/(I)? Let's compute both.

Given:

w is 4e14 rad/s.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

But wait, ħ is h/(2π), so ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) ) = (40)/(22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I should convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's see, 1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988. So 1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)^2 / (1.208e-46 kg·m²)

Wait, (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (since 1e-34 squared is 1e-68).

So numerator is about 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Denominator: 1.208e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.20e-23 J.

Wait, wait, no, let me compute that: 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ approx 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

So E_rot(J=1) is about 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing 9.2e-23 J (rotational) and 2.65e-19 J (vibrational), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon with the momentum corresponding to the rotational energy difference would be the one that allows the molecule to transition to the next state (J=1, n=0) with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, but wait a second. No, the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states. The molecule is currently in the ground state (n=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy could be either the next rotational state (J=1) or the next vibrational state (n=1). So which requires a lower energy photon?

Well, from the earlier calculations, the energy difference for rotational is 9.2e-23 J, and for vibrational is 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition is lower in energy. So the photon would need to have an energy of 9.2e-23 J.

Wait but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can undergo a transition where both J and n change. But I think the question is asking for the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the transition requiring the least energy. So it's either J=1 or n=1. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon would have that.

So, the photon's energy E_photon = ħ²/(2I) * 2, because for J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is ( (1)(2) - 0 ) * (ħ² / (2I)) )= (2) (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate the rotational energy difference accurately.

E_rot(J) = (ħ²/(2I)) * J (J+1).

For J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I) * (1/2) * 2 → no, wait, J=1: J(J+1)=2, so E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

So the energy difference ΔE = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but ħ²/(I) is what I computed earlier as 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy must be 9.2e-23 J.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. Since E = pc for a photon (because m=0), then p = E/c.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = ?

Wait, 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2 / 3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.066e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, the options are on the order of 1e-28 Ns. Wait, wait a second, 1 Ns is kg·m/s. So 3.066e-31 kg·m/s is 3.066e-31 Ns.

But the options are much larger: 1e-28 is three orders of magnitude higher. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me go back and check the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I, the moment of inertia.

Let me check I again.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = (40)/(22) = 1.81818... amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that more accurately.

1.81818 * 1.6605 = ?

1.8 *1.6605 is about 2.9889.

0.01818 *1.6605 ≈ 0.0302. So total is approximately 2.9889 + 0.0302 = 3.0191e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 3.0191e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.0191e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg·m².

Now ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)^2 / (1.2076e-46 kg·m²).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J²s².

Denominator is 1.2076e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2076 ) * 1e-22 ≈ approx 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

So that's correct. So E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.2 / 3) * 1e-31 kg·m/s ≈ 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options, the smallest is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is much bigger. So I'm getting a value three orders of magnitude smaller than the options. Did I make a mistake in units?

Wait, wait, wait. Did I calculate ħ²/(I) correctly?

Wait, wait! I think I messed up the calculation of the rotational energy. Because the rotational energy difference is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (ħ²/(2I))* (1*2) ) - 0.

So that's (2 * ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, so that's correct. So the energy is 9.2e-23 J, which is 9.2e-23 J.

Hmm, but the options are in the 1e-28 Ns range. Wait, 1 Ns is kg·m/s. So 9.2e-23 J is 9.2e-23 N·m (since J=N·m). So E_photon = 9.2e-23 N·m.

p_photon = E_photon / c = (9.2e-23 N·m) / (3e8 m/s) ) = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's 3.066e-31 Ns (since 1 Ns = kg·m/s). So that's way smaller than the options given.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the rotational transition. Because if the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, but none of the options match, maybe I should consider the vibrational transition instead.

Wait, vibrational energy difference is h w = 6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

So p = E/c = 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s, which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28
Option B: 2.3e-27
Option C: 1.1e-27
Option D:1.4e-28

Hmm, 8.83e-28 is closest to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the vibrational energy difference.

Wait, in the vibrational case, the energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + n h w, so the difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w.

Yes, so E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So p_photon = (2.65e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (2.65 /3 )e-27 kg·m/s ≈ 0.883e-27 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns, which is about 8.8e-28.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly twice that. So why the discrepancy?

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the vibrational energy difference. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the Raman active mode, which involves a change in both vibrational and rotational states. Alternatively, maybe the model is the non-rigid rotor, which complicates things, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question states that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model or non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor, the moment of inertia isn't constant, but varies with vibration. But I'm not sure how that affects the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is not just the vibrational or rotational transition, but a combination. Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the transition requiring the least energy.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires less energy (9.2e-23 J) than the vibrational (2.65e-19 J). So why is the photon's momentum not matching any options in that case?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the electronic transition, but no, the question is about rotation-vibration.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me check.

Wait, I have:

I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct. 1.818 amu is about 3.02e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

So r squared is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the question is not about rotational transition but vibrational. Because the rotational transition's photon momentum is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options, but the vibrational is 8.8e-28 Ns, which is close to option A (1.9e-28).

Wait, but 8.8e-28 is option ... none of the options exactly, but option A is 1.9e-28. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me recalculate h w.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4 )e( -34 +14 ) = 26.504e-20 J.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626 *4 * 1e(-34 +14) )= 26.504 * 1e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct. So E_photon = 2.6504e-19 J.

Then p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = approximately 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of that. Hmm.

Wait, wait another possibility: perhaps the photon's energy is the difference between the vibrational and rotational states, but that doesn't quite make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the vibrational transition but the rotational. But earlier calculation of the rotational transition's photon momentum is way lower than the options. So maybe I made a mistake in considering which transition is lower in energy.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the vibrational energy could have a zero-point energy, but I don't think that affects the transition energy.

Wait, another thought: maybe the energy difference is not purely rotational or vibrational but the next state after the fundamental is the first excited state, which could be a combination of J=1 and v=1. But that would require a higher energy than either transition alone.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculated vibrational transition gives a photon momentum of ~8.8e-28 Ns, but the options don't have this. The closest is option A: 1.9e-28, which is about a third of that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I mixed up the vibrational energy formula. The vibrational energy is (1/2) h w + h w n, but the transition from n=0 to n=1 is h w, correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator, but for the quantum model, the energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the transition from n=0 to n=1 is indeed h w.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct energy is h w, which gives p = (h w)/(c) = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(3e8) = (2.65e-19)/(3e8) )= ~8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

But the options don't include this value. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Raman transition, where the photon induces a change in both vibrational and rotational states, but that's more complex and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the next state being the first excited rotational state (J=1), and the energy difference is ħ²/(I) = 9.2e-23 J, leading to p = 3.06e-31 kg·m/s, which is way smaller than any of the options, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, but perhaps I should consider that the photon's energy is twice the vibrational energy or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the vibrational energy. Let's recheck:

h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. So p = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options are A: 1.9e-28, B:2.3e-27, C:1.1e-27, D:1.4e-28.

Hmm, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Another thought: perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). The next state would be the first excited state, which could be J=1 or n=1.

But which requires less energy? Earlier calculation shows J=1 requires less. So photon's energy would be 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.06e-31 Ns, which is option D: 1.4e-28? No, 1.4e-28 is about 1e-28, which is a thousand times larger than 3e-31.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the energy difference.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is not the only consideration. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the next state, which is the combination of the next vibrational and next rotational state.

Wait, but that would require more energy than either alone. So that can't be the lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule's transition to a higher vibrational state, but the photon's energy is the vibrational energy plus the rotational energy.

But that would be higher than either alone, so it's not the next lowest. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational energy but only the vibrational, leading to the 8.8e-28 Ns, but it's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me recheck that.

Wait, μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 *2 )/(22 ) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the rigid rotor, which ignores bond length changes, but the question says non-rigid.

Wait, maybe the non-rigid rotor model includes centrifugal distortion, but I don't think that affects the calculation of the moment of inertia for the fundamental state.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculations don't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that matches the vibrational transition's momentum.

The vibrational transition's p is ~8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't among the options. But option A is 1.9e-28, which is half of that. Did I miscalculate h*w?

Wait, let me recompute h*w.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

h*w = 6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = 2.65042806e-19 J.

So p = 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg·m/s.

Hmm, that's correct. So no option matches. Maybe the question intended to use the rotational transition, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating μ.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2 ) / (20 +2 ) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is not about the energy difference between states, but the photon's momentum when it's absorbed to go from the fundamental state to the next state, which may involve both rotational and vibrational transitions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition's momentum, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy in terms of kJ/mol or something else, but no, the question is about momentum in Ns.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition, which is 8.8e-28 Ns, but since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is not among the choices, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the vibrational part. Let me recompute h*w.

6.626e-34 *4e14 = ?

6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-34+14.

6.626 *4 = 26.504.

-34 +14 = -20.

So 26.504e-20 J. Which is 2.6504e-19 J. So correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator when calculating p. Wait, c is 3e8 m/s. So 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the rotation-vibration coupling, which might involve a different energy calculation, but I don't know enough about that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the energy of the photon being the sum of the vibrational and rotational transitions, but that would be higher than either alone.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, the only one that's close to the vibrational transition's momentum is option A:1.9e-28, but it's about half of what I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of h*w.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626 *4=26.504, so 26.504e-20 J, which is 2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

Then p = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = (2.6504 /3 )e-27 = 0.883e-27 = 8.83e-28. So 8.8e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy of the photon as the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions. So E_photon = E_rot + E_vib.

Which would be 9.2e-23 + 2.65e-19 J = approximately 2.74e-19 J.

p =2.74e-19 /3e8 = ~9.13e-28 Ns.

Which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition but with a factor I'm missing. Like, perhaps the model is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the moment of the molecule's angular momentum, but I don't think so.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state (v=1, J=0), so only the vibrational transition occurs.

In that case, E_photon = h w.

Which gives p_photon = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy required to reach the next state, which could be the first vibrational state, but perhaps the question is using the formula for the rotational energy in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy difference is E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * (J+1)(J+2) - J (J+1). For J=0 to J=1, that's E_rot = ( (2) ) (ħ²/(2I)) ) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Which we calculated as 9.2e-23 J.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next vibrational state, but the calculation leads to 8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 6.626e-34 *4e14:

6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626 *4 =26.504; exponents: 1e-34 *1e14=1e-20.

So 26.504e-20 J = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8.

3e8 is 3 *1e8 =3e8.

So 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = (2.6504 /3 )e-27 ≈ 0.8835e-27 =8.835e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.835e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm. 8.8e-28 is closest to option A:1.9e-28.

But why is there a discrepancy? Did I mess up the exponent?

Wait, 2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s = p.

Wait, 2.65e-19 /3e8 = (2.65 /3 ) * 1e-27 = 0.883e-27 =8.83e-28.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that for rotation-vibration coupling, the transition might involve a change in both J and v, but I'm not familiar enough with that to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the difference between the first excited rotational state and the ground state, which is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.06e-31 Ns, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy required for the molecule to transition from the fundamental state to the first excited vibrational state, which requires a photon with energy equal to the vibrational energy difference. In that case, the momentum is 8.8e-28 Ns, but since it's not an option, perhaps the question intended to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the photon's momentum based on the vibrational transition but using a different formula. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the energy of a photon in terms of wavelength, but that doesn't seem helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy based on the vibrational frequency, considering the bond length and masses, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the translational energy, but that's unrelated to the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when it's absorbed, regardless of the energy, but I don't think so.

I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the vibrational transition's photon momentum is ~8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't an option. The rotational transition's momentum is ~3e-31 Ns, which also isn't an option.

But given the options, the closest to the vibrational transition is option A:1.9e-28. However, that's about half of what I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the vibrational energy.

h w = 6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a diatomic, and when the photon is absorbed, it changes both vibrational and rotational states. For example, from (v=0,J=0) to (v=1,J=1). But that would require more energy than either transition alone, so it's not the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation that the photon's momentum is 8.83e-28 Ns, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ.

Wait, maybe I should calculate μ again.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2) / (20 +2 )=40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

1.818 amu *1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 3.02e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass in a different way, but I don't think so.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct answer based on my calculations is approximately 8.8e-28 Ns, but since it's not an option, I'm probably missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the rotational transition, but that gives a much smaller momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units again.

Energy E = h*f. Momentum p = E/c.

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s.

f is the frequency, which is w/(2π). Because w is angular frequency in rad/s.

So f = w/(2π) = (4e14)/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.283) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

Then E_photon = h*f =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.23e-20 J.

p_photon = E/c =4.23e-20 /3e8 ≈1.41e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 1.41e-28 Ns. Oh! That's close to option D:1.4e-28.

Wait a minute, yes! I think I made a mistake earlier by using the angular frequency directly instead of converting it to frequency. Because w is angular frequency (in radians per second), and the photon's energy is based on the frequency f, which is w/(2π).

So, earlier I used E = h w, but actually E = h f = h (w/(2π)).

Ah! That's where I went wrong. So the correct energy is E = h w/(2π), not h w.

So let me re-calculate.

E_photon = h * (w/(2π)).

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

So f =4e14/(2π) ≈6.366e13 Hz.

E_photon =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈6.626 *6.366 = approx 42.3, so 42.3e-21 J =4.23e-20 J.

Then p_photon = E/c =4.23e-20 /3e8 =1.41e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 1.41e-28 Ns. So option D is 1.4e-28, which matches this value closely.

Ah! So the mistake was using the angular frequency directly instead of converting it to regular frequency. Now the calculation matches option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the system using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its ground state, corresponding to the lowest vibrational state \(v=0\) and the lowest rotational state \(J=0\). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\(v=0 \to v=1\)) or a rotational transition (\(J=0 \to J=1\)). The energy of the photon must match the energy difference of the transition.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Transition**:
   - The vibrational energy levels are given by \(E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega\), where \(n\) is the vibrational quantum number and \(\omega\) is the angular frequency of vibration.
   - The energy difference for the transition \(v=0 \to v=1\) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega
     \]
   - Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):
     \[
     p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
     \]

2. **Rotational Transition**:
   - The rotational energy levels are given by \(E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)\), where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\), \(I\) is the moment of inertia, and \(J\) is the rotational quantum number.
   - The energy difference for the transition \(J=0 \to J=1\) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
     \]
   - The moment of inertia \(I\) is calculated as \(I = \mu r^2\), where \(\mu\) is the reduced mass and \(r\) is the bond length. The reduced mass is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{(20 \, \text{amu}) \cdot (2 \, \text{amu})}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The bond length \(r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), so:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
   - Substituting \(\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46}} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The corresponding photon momentum is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
     \]

3. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational transition requires \(8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\), while the rotational transition requires \(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}\). Since the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, the vibrational transition is relevant.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The angular frequency \(\omega\) is related to the frequency \(f\) by \(\omega = 2\pi f\). The energy of the photon should be calculated using \(E = h f = \frac{h \omega}{2\pi}\). Recomputing:
     \[
     f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}
     \]
     \[
     E = h f = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.366 \times 10^{13}) = 4.23 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]
     \[
     p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{4.23 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
     \]

### Conclusion:
The momentum of the photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy is approximately \(1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\), which matches option **D**.
