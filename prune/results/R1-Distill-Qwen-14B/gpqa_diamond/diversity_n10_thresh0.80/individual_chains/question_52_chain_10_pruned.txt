Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star whose properties change when dark spots cover part of its surface. When there are no spots, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. Observations show that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, right. So the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels depends on the temperature. I remember the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of different energy levels. The ratio should be given by (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the transition wavelength is given as 1448 Å. That’s in the near ultraviolet range. I think this corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels. Because energy is related to wavelength via E = hc/λ. So I can calculate the energy difference E2-E1 using that wavelength.

Let me write down the relevant equations:

The Boltzmann factor is (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But since the problem is about the ratio when spots are present versus when they're not, I think we'll need to compute the ratio at both temperatures and find the factor.

Wait, wait. The star's overall Teff changes. But the spots themselves might have a different temperature. Oh wait, but the question says the overall photospheric Teff decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. So I think the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when the spots are present.

Wait, but the spots are cooler regions, right? So when parts of the star are covered by spots, those regions are at a lower temperature. But the overall effective temperature is the average, but how does that affect the photosphere?

Wait, the problem states that the effective temperature of the photosphere when there are spots is 5500 K. So I should model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when there are spots.

So, when there are no spots, Teff is 6000 K, and when there are spots, it's 5500 K. So the ratio of Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2 (n1/n2) would change based on the temperature.

Wait, the question says the ratio of n1 to n2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Because the ratio is lower, that means the number of atoms in level 2 increases relative to level 1, or the number in level 1 decreases relative to level 2.

Wait, let's think. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to
