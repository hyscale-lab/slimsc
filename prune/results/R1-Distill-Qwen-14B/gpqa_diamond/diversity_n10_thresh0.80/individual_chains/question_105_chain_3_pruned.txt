Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because the star is spotted on only one hemisphere, when it rotates, photometric observations (which measure brightness over time) will show periodic brightness variations. The interesting part is that this variation can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. 

The question is asking: if instead, the star wasn't covered by spots, what radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? So, we need to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.

Hmm. I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets involves the planet passing in front of the star, blocking some of the star's light. The depth of the dip in brightness (the light curve) depends on the ratio of the areas of the planet and star.

But in this case, the star has spots. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light. So when the spots are facing towards us, the total brightness of the star as observed would decrease, leading to a dip similar to a transit.

Wait, but in this problem, the star without spots would produce a certain light curve variation when a planet transits. So the question is, given the observed variation due to spots (which acts like a planet), what planet size would cause the same variation?

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the star with spots is causing a variation that is being mistaken for a planet. So we need to calculate the radius of a planet that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spot-induced variation.

Wait, but the star is already spotted. So when the spots are on the visible side, the star's brightness decreases. So the observed variation is due to the spots. But if instead, the star wasn't spotted and had a planet, what planet size would cause the same dip?

So, first, I need to find the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, equate that to the amplitude caused by a planet
