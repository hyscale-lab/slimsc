Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So the problem describes a reaction involving a substance X. Let me try to break down the information given.

First, X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. That probably means it's an element that commonly has isotopes, like maybe carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), chlorine (Cl), etc. Heavy isotopes are usually Cl-35 vs Cl-37, for example.

When X reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, same number of n and p. So each atom of W has equal number of n and p. Wait, but a molecule's composition depends on what the atoms are. Let's think: the gas W is probably water (H2O)? Wait no, wait. If each molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons, what could that be?

Wait, wait. Let's think about the structure. If each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, but each molecule is made up of atoms. So for each atom in the molecule, the number of neutrons and protons must be equal. Or does it mean the total in the molecule?

Wait, the molecule of gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. So total neutrons in the molecule equals total protons. So for example, if W is H2O, each H has 1 p and 0 n (since protium is 1^1H), O has 8 p and 8 n (since O-16 is 8 p and 8 n). So for H2O: each H contributes 1 p and 0 n, and O contributes 8 p and 8 n. Total protons in H2O molecule: 2*1 +8=10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. So 10 vs 8, not same. So not H2O.

Another possibility: if W is CO2. Let's see. Carbon has 6 p, and let's say it's C-12: 6 n. O has 8 p, 8 n. CO2 molecule has 1 C and 2 O. Total protons:6
