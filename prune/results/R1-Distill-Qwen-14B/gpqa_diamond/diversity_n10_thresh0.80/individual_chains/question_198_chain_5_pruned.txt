Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in the solution. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, first, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. Each β corresponds to a different complex. So, the first thing is to figure out what each β represents. I think β1 is for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^0, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2−. Wait, or maybe the order is different? Let me make sure.

Wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}. The formula for each would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3}^0, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}. So, the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So higher β for β3 than β2 and β4. So the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^0, but wait, β4 is 16, which is less than β3. Hmm.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, what's the blue one? I think the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which is the second complex, with β2=40. Or wait, wait. No, wait. The blue ones might be [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the colors of the different cobalt complexes. But the question specifically mentions the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN groups. So that's probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex.

Wait, but in the options, the answers are in the 10-40% range, so I need
