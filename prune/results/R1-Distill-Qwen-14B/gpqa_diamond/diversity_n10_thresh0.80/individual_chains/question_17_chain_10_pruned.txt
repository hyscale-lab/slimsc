Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. So when they say the solution has a Ca-EDTA complex, I think that's the form where Ca²+ is bound to EDTA, making it unavailable as free Ca²+ ions in solution. But wait, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Or perhaps the complex dissociates a little bit, releasing some Ca²+.

Wait, no. If it's a stoichiometric complex, that means the ratio is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA. So the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 M. But how does that translate to the concentration of free Ca²+ ions?

I think I need to use the formation constant. The formation constant, Kf, tells me about the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more the complex is formed. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this case, the complex is already present at 0.02 M. So the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. The question is, what is [Ca²+]?

But wait, do I have enough information about the EDTA concentration? Or is it that the EDTA is in excess, so that the concentration of free EDTA is approximately the same as the initial concentration, because the complex is formed almost completely.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is more about considering the dissociation of the complex. Because even though the complex is stable, a tiny amount might dissociate, releasing Ca²+.

So, the formula I think I need to use comes from the formation constant. Rearranging the equation, [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2
