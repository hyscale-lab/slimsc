Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times larger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength for their black body radiation, I think. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The question is about the luminosity difference between them, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So the options are factors by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. Let's see, the options are around 2.2 to 2.35.

Wait, the key here is that both stars have the same peak wavelength. Because we know from black body radiation that the peak wavelength is related to the star's temperature. The formula I remember is Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, T is same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Oh, so that's a point. So T1 = T2. Wait, but in reality, more massive stars can have higher temperatures. But the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same, so their temperatures are same. Interesting.

Now, luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, if T is the same for both, then L is proportional to R squared. Because R is 1.5 times for Star_1. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So substituting, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T^4. L2 is 4π R2² σ T^4. So the ratio L1/L2 would be ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * (
