Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, it's not as straightforward as just adding them up. Oh right, you can't just say 0.6c plus 0.5c because that would give more than the speed of light, which isn't possible.

Wait, the problem states that both are moving in the positive x-direction. So one's moving faster than the other? No, actually, the masses are different but their speeds are given. So, astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c.

First, I need to find the relative speed between them. Since they're moving in the same direction, I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity applies here. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), right? But wait, u and v are the speeds of the two objects as observed from the rest frame. Or are they the speeds relative to each other? Hmm, no, I think the formula is for when you have two objects moving at u and v relative to a rest frame, and you want the speed of one relative to the other.

Wait, let me make sure. Let's say the rest frame is the one in which both astronauts are moving. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or is it the other way around?

No, the question is about the relative speed between them. So, it's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So which one is which? Let's clarify. Let me think.

If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) )? Wait no, that would be (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²), but I might need to get the signs right.

Wait, let's think about it. If A is moving at u =0.6c in the rest frame, and B is moving at v=0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? The formula is (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Wait no, I think the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) when you're finding the relative speed of B as seen by A, where u is A's speed in the rest frame, and v is B's speed in the rest frame.

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula, but I can't right now. I remember that the relative speed is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, let's get the signs correct. Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, and A is faster than B (0.6c >0.5c), then from A's frame, B is moving backward? No, wait, no. Both are moving forward, so in A's frame, B would be moving slower. Let me think again.

Wait, no, if A is moving at 0.6c in the rest frame, and B is moving at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, the relative speed of B should be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/(c²)) )= (-0.1c)/(0.7) )= -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction. But since speed is a scalar, the magnitude is 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

Wait, but wait, the relative speed is the magnitude, so it would be 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for relative speed.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. The total energy would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut, considering their relativistic speeds.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c². So for each astronaut, calculate their gamma factor, multiply by their mass, and sum the two.

First, for astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Next, astronaut B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Adding them together, E_total ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c², which is approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc².

So option C matches both the relative speed and the total energy. So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). The formula for the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{vu}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (Astronaut A's speed) and \( v = 0.5c \) (Astronaut B's speed). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is a scalar, so the relative speed is \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
\]

#### For Astronaut A (\( 2m, v = 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For Astronaut B (\( 3m, v = 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 = 5.9641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
