Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The options given are combinations of these.

Wait, first, I should remember what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, meaning the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's the combination of rotations, boosts, and translations. Oh wait, but SMEFT is a field theory, so it's a relativistic theory, right? So it should respect Poincare symmetry.

But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT should too. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. So any operator not respecting that would be excluded.

Now, the options are 1 and 2, which are Lorentz and Poincare. Are they both required, or is one a subset of the other? Because Poincare includes Lorentz. So, if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So in the SMEFT, all operators must respect both. So in the options, any that require both will be correct.

Wait, but the question asks which must be respected by all operators. So Poincare symmetry is more than Lorentz—so if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So if an option includes both 1 and 2, that's correct. But wait, are they both required, or is one a part of the other?

Wait, the Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, it might not respect either, but respecting Poincare implies respecting Lorentz. So for SMEFT operators, which must respect Poincare, they must respect both. So in the question, which is about which symmetries must be respected, both Lorentz and Poincare would be correct.

Wait, but maybe Poincare is the broader symmetry. So if you have a symmetry under the Poincare group, you automatically have Lorentz symmetry. So in the list of options, if the question is which symmetries must be respected, then both 1 and 2 are required. But wait, no—because Poincare is a larger symmetry. So the operators must respect Poincare, which implies they respect Lorentz. So perhaps the correct symmetries are 1 and 2. But looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is the symmetry, then Lorentz is automatically included. So in the options, if the question includes 2, then 1 is automatically included.

Wait, but the options are presented as four separate options. So the question is, which must be respected. So let me think about each symmetry.

Lorentz symmetry: All operators must be Lorentz invariant. That's a given because SMEFT is a relativistic theory. So yes, 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry: Also includes translations. So operators must be invariant under Poincare transformations. So 2 is correct.

CP symmetry: The operators may or may not respect it, depending on the beyond the Standard Model physics. SMEFT is a framework that allows for operators that can break various symmetries, like CP. So not all operators respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not necessarily respected by all operators.

CPT symmetry: This is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories. Since the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. Because if you have an effective theory, all the symmetries that the underlying theory respects (like CPT) must be preserved. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So now, which options include 1,2, and 4? Let's look at the options.

Options:

A) 1,2 → Includes 1 and 2, but not 4.

B) 3,4 → Doesn't include 1 and 2, so incorrect.

C) 1,2,4 → Correct, includes all three.

D) 1,3,4 → Includes 3, which I don't think is required.

Wait, but wait, I thought that SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So that includes Lorentz. So the operator must respect both 1 and 2. So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait: does the SMEFT require all operators to respect Poincare symmetry? Because SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but I'm a bit confused because some sources say that the effective theory respects Poincare symmetry. So in that case, operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So 1 and 2 are both required.

So among the options, option C includes 1,2,4. So that's the correct choice.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a relativistic effective field theory, meaning it must respect the symmetries of the underlying Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry ensures that the laws of physics are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Since SMEFT is a relativistic theory, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is required.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry. Respecting Poincaré symmetry automatically ensures Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetry. However, SMEFT allows for operators that can break CP symmetry, depending on the beyond-the-Standard-Model physics being modeled. Thus, CP symmetry is not necessarily required by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry (charge, parity, and time reversal) is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, including effective field theories like SMEFT. Since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory derived from the Standard Model, it must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is required.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, only **Option C (1, 2, 4)** includes all three required symmetries.

Answer: C
