Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think. I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The question gives a Lagrangian term, and the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to figure out which decay channels are allowed.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction term involves X multiplying ψ_f, which I think means that X can decay into fermions ψ_f and their antiparticles. But wait, the term is -λ f f-bar... Oh wait, maybe I should parse it differently. The interaction term is probably something like X ψ ψ, so X couples to fermion pairs.

So, the X boson can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the energy is sufficient. But because the X has a mass of 6 GeV, the fermion pair's combined mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

What's the mass of each fermion? Let me recall:

- Up (u) quark: ~0.5 GeV (but actually around 2-5 MeV, but negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- Down (d) quark: similar to u, about 3-5 MeV
- Strange (s) quark: ~100 MeV, but wait, I think it's around 100 MeV? Or maybe 50-100 MeV?
- Charm (c) quark: around 1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b) quark: about 4.5-5 GeV
- Top (t) quark: way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so cannot be produced from 6 GeV X.
- Electron (e): negligible, ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.77 GeV
- Neutrinos: almost massless, but the problem doesn't mention them, so probably not relevant here.

Wait, but wait. The X can only decay into fermion pairs if the sum of their masses is less than or equal to X's mass. But since for most fermions, their masses are negligible compared to 6 GeV, except for the bottom quark and tau lepton.

Wait, let's list the possible fermions:

Quarks: u, d, s, c, b, t. But t is too heavy. So possible quarks are u, d, s, c, b.

Leptons: e, μ, τ, and their antiparticles.

But wait, the X boson is neutral, right? Because the decay products must have the same charge as X. But in the given Lagrangian, the term is X ψ ψ_bar, which suggests that X is a neutral boson because it can couple to a fermion and its antifermion.

So the decay products must be a fermion and its antifermion. So any possible pairs, as long as the mass is allowed.

So possible fermions are quarks and leptons.

Wait, but each pair has a rest mass. Let's compute for each fermion pair:

For quarks, the pair would be 2m (since it's a quark and antiquark). For leptons, it's 2m_e, etc.

But wait, the X is 6 GeV, so the maximum possible pair is when the sum is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me go through each possible fermion pair.

1. b quark: mass ~4.5 GeV. 2m = ~9 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, so 9 >6. Not allowed. Wait, wait wait, that can't be right. Because X can't decay into a pair that's more massive than itself. So, for the pair to be produced, 2m_fermion <= mass of X.

So for quarks, 2m_quark <=6 GeV.

So m_quark <=3 GeV.

Which quarks have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV?

u, d, s, c, and b is too heavy.

Wait, wait, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b quark pair.

Wait, but sometimes in particle physics, quarks are considered as being produced with their masses, but perhaps the question is considering whether the fermion is accessible based on phase space. So let's compute each possible fermion pair.

Wait for each fermion:

- u quark: m_u ~ 2 MeV → 2m_u ~4 MeV → allowed (since 4 <6 GeV)
- d: similar to u, ~5 MeV → allowed
- s: ~100 MeV → allowed
- c: ~1.5 GeV → 2*1.5=3 GeV → 3 <6 → allowed
- b: 4.5 GeV → 9 GeV >6 → not allowed

Leptons:
- e: 0.5 MeV → allowed
- μ: ~0.1 GeV → 2*0.1=0.2 GeV <6 → allowed
- τ: ~1.77 GeV → 2*1.77=3.54 GeV <6 → allowed

So the possible fermion pairs are:

u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, e e+, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Wait, but wait, what about the top quark? No, t is way too heavy, as discussed.

So possible decay channels for X are:

X → u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b, s, u, d, tau, e. But wait, that includes b, which is not allowed because 2m_b exceeds X's mass.

Option B: X→c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So includes c, which is allowed since 2m_c=3 GeV <6 GeV.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark in the options? Let me check the options again.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that includes c, which is allowed.

Wait, but the options don't list all possible. Let me look.

Option B is X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That's all allowed except for c, which is allowed because 3 GeV <6 GeV. So yes, option B includes c.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? As I thought, they can't decay into b because 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So any option that includes b is invalid.

Looking back at the options:

A) Includes b, which is invalid.

B) Doesn't include b, but includes c.

C) Includes c, t, but t is too heavy. So C is invalid.

D) Includes b and tau, but not c? Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options:

Option A: X→b, s, u, d, tau, e.

Option B: X→c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option C: X→c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e.

Option D: X→b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So correct possible decays are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So which option matches? Option B.

Wait, but option B also includes c and tau, which are allowed.

Wait, but in the decay, the fermion pairs must have 2m ≤6 GeV. So for c, 2m_c=3 GeV <6 → allowed.

For tau, 2m_tau= ~3.54 GeV <6 → allowed.

So all these decays are allowed for X → fermion pairs.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the options.

Looking again:

Option A) X→b, s, u, d, tau, e. This includes b which is not allowed.

Option B) X→c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.

Option C) Includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy; 2m_t is way above 6 GeV, so C is wrong.

Option D) Includes b and tau, but no c. Wait, does it have c? No, D is X→b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So no c and no.

So the correct option is B, because it includes c and tau, which are allowed.

Wait, but the mass of the X is 6 GeV. For c quark, 2 * 1.5 GeV =3 GeV, so that's under 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into c c-bar.

Similarly, tau is 1.77 GeV, so 2*1.77=3.54 <6 → allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, but the total rest mass of the pair must not exceed the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fermion Masses**:
   - Quarks: \( u, d, s, c, b, t \) with masses approximately \( 2 \, \text{MeV}, 5 \, \text{MeV}, 100 \, \text{MeV}, 1.5 \, \text{GeV}, 4.5 \, \text{GeV}, 173 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively.
   - Leptons: \( e, \mu, \tau \) with masses approximately \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV}, 0.1 \, \text{GeV}, 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively.

2. **Allowed Fermion Pairs**:
   - \( u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \): For these quarks, \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so all are allowed.
   - \( b \bar{b} \): \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so this decay is not allowed.
   - \( t \bar{t} \): \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so this decay is not allowed.
   - \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \): For these leptons, \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so all are allowed.

3. **Decay Channels**:
   - Allowed decays: \( X \rightarrow u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \).
   - Disallowed decays: \( X \rightarrow b \bar{b}, t \bar{t} \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
