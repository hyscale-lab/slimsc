Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenstates are related to the direction of the angular momentum vector. Since the operator is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z, I think I need to construct the operator along the direction n and then find its eigenvector.

First, the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis, and φ would be the azimuthal angle, which is zero here since it's in the x-z plane.

The operator P is a vector operator, so the operator along n would be the dot product of P and the unit vector n. So P_n = P · n. That gives P_n = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. Since n_y is zero (because it's in x-z plane), the P_y term drops out. So P_n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but I should be careful with the signs because sometimes the direction affects the sign. Let me think. The unit vector n is along some direction in x-z. So if θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, then n_x = sinθ, n_y=0, n_z=cosθ.

So P_n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Each of the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P_n = (ħ/2)( sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Simplify that:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

The matrix for P_x sinθ is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
The matrix for P_z cosθ is [[cosθ,0], [0, -cosθ]]
Summing them, the (1,1) element is cosθ, (1,2) is sinθ, (2,1) is sinθ, and (2,2) is -cosθ.

So the matrix becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>
Which can be written as [P_n - (+ħ/2) I] |v> = 0.

Wait, no. More accurately, the matrix equation would be (P_n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, P_n is (ħ/2) times the matrix. So when we subtract (ħ/2) times the identity matrix, the matrix becomes:

[cosθ - (ħ/2)/(ħ/2) * 1, sinθ]
[sinθ, -cosθ - (ħ/2)/(ħ/2)*1 ]

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. Let me write P_n as (ħ/2) * M, where M is the matrix [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

So the eigenvalue equation is (ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. So in our case, λ is +1, because (ħ/2) λ = given eigenvalue. Oh wait, the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So:

(ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2)(+1) |v> → M |v> = (+1) |v>.

So the equation is (M - I) |v> = 0.

M - I is the matrix:

[ cosθ - 1, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ]

We need to find the non-trivial solutions (v not zero) to this equation.

The determinant of (M - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Let's calculate the determinant:

det(M - I) = (cosθ - 1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)^2.

Expanding this:

= (-cosθ (cosθ -1) -1 (cosθ -1)) - sin²θ
= (-cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ +1 ) - sin²θ
= (-cos²θ +1 ) - sin²θ
But wait, cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, so 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ. So:

= (1 - cos²θ) - sin²θ
= sin²θ - sin²θ
= 0.

So determinant is zero, which makes sense because we're looking for eigenvectors.

Now, to find the eigenvector, we can set up the equations from the matrix (M - I) |v> = 0.

The equations are:

(cosθ - 1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
sinθ v1 + (-cosθ - 1) v2 = 0

Let me take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → (1 - cosθ) v1 = sinθ v2 → v2 = [ (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ ] v1.

Hmm, also, I can note that (1 - cosθ) / sinθ is equal to tan(theta/2). Because from trigonometric identities, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So (1 - cosθ)/sin theta = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = tan(theta/2).

So v2 = tan(theta/2) v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, tan(theta/2) v1 ].

Let me set v1 = sqrt(2/3) ħ. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, the answer options have some involving sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ. So maybe I should normalize the eigenvector.

Wait, but the eigenvector components can be scaled by any non-zero scalar. Let me denote v1 = a, then v2 = a tan(theta/2).

The normalization condition is |v1|² + |v2|² = 1 (since eigenvectors are usually taken as unit vectors, though in this case perhaps they're given as non-normalized in the
