Okay, so I have this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n when the medium is stationary. But here, the medium is moving. So how does that affect it?

I think about the principles involved. There's the concept of relative velocity, but I'm a bit confused about relativity here. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is c/n in that medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, does that change the speed observed in the lab frame?

Wait, Einstein's theory of relativity says that the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the observer's motion. But here, the medium isn't a vacuumâ€”it's glass with index n. So does that change things?

Oh, but wait, in a medium, the speed is v = c/n, but when the medium is moving, how does that combine? I think this might be a case of velocity addition in special relativity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, maybe it's a simpler case because the light is within the moving glass, so we can apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the glass is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame would depend on that
