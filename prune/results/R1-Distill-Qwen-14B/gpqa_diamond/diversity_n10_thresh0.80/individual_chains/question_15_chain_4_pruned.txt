Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again. So, the question is about which planet is more likely to transit its star, so researchers should choose to observe that one. Both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host star properties.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like the area of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 times (a sin i / R_star), but I might be mixing up some terms. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (a/(R_s)), but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us, which is a geometric probability. The formula I recall is P_transit ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a(1 - e^2)^0.5)) ), but wait, no that's the formula for the transit depth or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, I remember that the probability for a planet to transit is roughly (R*)^-2 times some function of the orbital parameters.

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view) depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. The probability is higher when the star is smaller because the planet is more likely to block our view. Also, the probability increases when the planet's orbit is closer because the solid angle is larger.

Wait, no, wait. The probability that a planet transits is proportional to (R*/a)^2, where R* is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet's orbit has to be such that when we look from Earth, the planet passes in front of the star. The bigger the star, the smaller the chance, because the angular size is smaller. Similarly, if the planet is closer (smaller a), then the probability increases because the orbital plane's alignment has a higher chance of crossing our line of sight.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me think about this more carefully. The transit probability is given by (R*/a)^2, but I might have that reversed. Alternatively, the formula I found in my notes is P_transit ≈ (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2 (1 - e^2)) ), but I'm not sure. No, wait, that's the transit depth perhaps. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the formula from the transit method. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will result in a transit is approximately (R_s / a)^2, where R_s is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet needs to pass in front of the star, and the chance depends on how large the star appears relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability P is given by:

P = (R_s + R_p)^2 / (a^2 (1 - e^2)) )

But since both
