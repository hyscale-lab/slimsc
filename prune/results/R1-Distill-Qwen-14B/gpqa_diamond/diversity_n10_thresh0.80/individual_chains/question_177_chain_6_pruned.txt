Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the problem is about luminosity, right? So mass might not directly be the key here, but maybe it's a distractor. I'll keep that in mind.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So, if both stars have the same lambda_max, that means their temperatures must be the same, right? Because if T were different, lambda_max would change. So, both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect luminosity? Oh, wait! Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness of the star, independent of distance. But when we observe the star's spectrum, a high radial velocity can cause a Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelength. But in this problem, the peak wavelengths are the same, so maybe the Doppler shift is accounted for? Or perhaps not, because the observed wavelengths are adjusted. Hmm, not sure if this affects the calculation of luminosity here. Because the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies, so their intrinsic properties are what's important. So maybe the observed wavelength is the same, but the intrinsic temperature is the same because we've accounted for any Doppler shifts. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Okay, the problem says they computed the luminosity using the black body radiation formula, so I think the Doppler shift due to radial velocity doesn't affect the intrinsic temperature calculation. Or wait, no. Because if a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be blueshifted, but since both stars have the same observed lambda_max, that implies that their intrinsic temperatures are the same. Because if one was moving towards us and the other away, the observed lambda_max would be different. But since they're the same, their temperatures are the same. So the temperature of both stars is the same.

So, now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since both stars have the same T, the luminosity depends on the radius squared. So, L is proportional to R².

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, L1 = (R1² / R2²) * L2. Substituting R1 = 1.5 R2, L1 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / R2² ) * L2 = (2.25 R2²) / R2² * L2 = 2.25 L2. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. Wait, that's option A, which is ~2.25.

But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. Hmm, but wait, the question says "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of." So, L1/L2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25, so option A.

Wait, but why are the mass and radial velocities given? Did I miss
