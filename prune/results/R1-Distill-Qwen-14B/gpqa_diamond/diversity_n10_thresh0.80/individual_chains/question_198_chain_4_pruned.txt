Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved in determining the distribution of species in solution. Let me see.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are 9, 40, 63, and 16, respectively. I think these β values correspond to the formation of different complexes, like CoSCN, Co(SCN)_2, and so on.

Wait, right! The stability constant β indicates how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more favored. So, the higher the β, the more of that complex will form.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. Blue dithiocyanato complex—I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2 maybe? Or wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. So I need to figure out which complex is the blue one, but I think for the purpose of this problem, it's just about calculating the distribution based on the β values.

So, let's think about the possible complexes. For Co(II), the possible complexes with SCN- are:

1. Co(SCN)^-, which is the first complex, β1=9.
2. Co(SCN)_2, which would have β2=40.
3. Co(SCN)_3^2-, with β3=63.
4. Co(SCN)_4^3-, with β4=16.

Wait, but wait, the way the problem is phrased, the stability constants are given for each step. So β1 is for [CoSCN] forming from Co^2+ and SCN-, β2 is for the next step, adding another SCN-, etc.

But I think the way these stability constants work is as cumulative constants. So βn is the overall constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So, for each complex, the formation is stepwise, but the overall is the product of the previous β's.

Wait, no, the stability constants are usually defined as the formation of each complex step by step. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+ (Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+), β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2] (adding another SCN^- to the first complex), and so on.

So, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1 * β2, right? Because each step multiplies the previous.

Wait, no, wait. I think the way they are presented here, each β is the overall constant for the nth complex. For example, β1 = [CoSCN]/([Co][SCN]). So, each β represents the cumulative formation up to that complex.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. In general, the stability constant K (or β) for a complex can be written as the product of the stepwise formation constants. For example, if the first complex is CoSCN^+,
