Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about meson resonance decay. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. But I'm not too clear on all the details, so I need to think this through step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's either femtometers or something smaller.

Wait, I think mean decay length has something to do with how far the particle travels before decaying. But how do I calculate that? I remember that the mean lifetime is related to the width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy (which is the width Γ) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (which is the lifetime τ) should be on the order of ħ. So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, the width Γ is given in MeV. I have to make sure the units are compatible. Oh right, ħ is usually expressed in units of GeV·s or something like that. Let me recall the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But since ħ is h/(2π), it's about 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I need this in units of GeV·seconds. Because Γ is given in MeV, I should convert that to GeV.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

So now, to compute τ. Let's compute ħ divided by Γ. But wait, what's the numerical value of ħ in GeV·s? I think I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me double-check that. Oh right, because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, and Planck's constant is about 6.626e-34 J·s, so when you convert to GeV·s, you get ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Yes.

So τ ≈ ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's a very short time. But particles with short lifetimes decay quickly, so the distance they travel depends on their velocity. So the mean decay distance is v multiplied by τ. But wait, how do I find the velocity?

Ah, the production energy E_X
