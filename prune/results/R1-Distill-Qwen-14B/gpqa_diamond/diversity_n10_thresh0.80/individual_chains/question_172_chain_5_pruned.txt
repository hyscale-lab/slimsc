Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I think that means I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Hmm, right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level, ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So, I think that means the ratio of the upper to lower states for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe the excitation states are twice as excited, so maybe n_upper for star_1 is twice as much as for star_2?

Wait, no, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is what's being compared. Let me clarify. The problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that for star_2.

So, let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. So, R1 = 2 * R2.

But using the Boltzmann equation, R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). If the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars, and assuming that the statistical weights g are the same for both stars (since they’re both iron atoms, same element, same transition), then the ratio R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but if the statistical weights are the same, then R1 = R2 would imply that their temperatures are the same. But in this case, R1 is twice R2. So, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is saying that the excitation (meaning the population in the excited state) is twice as much for star_1, but that may depend on the temperature. So, the ratio R1 = (n_upper)_1 / (n_lower)_1, and R2 = (n_upper)_2 / (n_lower)_2.

Given R1 = 2 R2.

But each R is exp(-ΔE/(k T)) multiplied by the g factors. Assuming g_upper and g_lower are same for both stars, then R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T1)] - [ΔE/(k T2)] ) ) = exp( ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Wait, wait, because R = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So R1/R2 = exp(ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)) ) = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Since R1 = 2 R2, then R1/R2 = 2. So:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, let me double-check. Because R = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2= exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

So,

ln(R1/R2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Given R1 = 2 R2,

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but I can rearrange 1/T2 -1/T1 as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but in the equation, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So, when I plug that in:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the problem gives the energy difference ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, and I know that k
