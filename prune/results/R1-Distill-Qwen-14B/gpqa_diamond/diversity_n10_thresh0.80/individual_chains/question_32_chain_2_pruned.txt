Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li is lithium. Wait, lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the isotope is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

Next, I should find the rest mass of the Li nucleus. But wait, the rest mass of a nucleus isn't just the sum of protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh wait, but maybe for this problem, they expect me to approximate the mass as the sum of its nucleons, each being a proton or neutron. Because the exact mass might be complicated otherwise. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the atomic mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has an atomic number Z=3. So the number of protons is 3, neutrons is 3. The atomic mass can be found using the periodic table. Let me think, the atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but that's the atomic mass for Li-7, I think. Because Li has several isotopes, with Li-7 being the most common. So Li-6's atomic mass is around 6.923 g/mol. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for relativistic energy, which requires the rest mass.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to calculate the relativistic gamma factor and then compute the total energy. Because the speed is given as 0.96c, so we can find gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².
So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.
sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate the square root of 0.0784. So 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So 1/0.28 is exactly 10/2.8, which is 3.57142857... Approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m * c². But wait, what's m here? It's the rest mass of the Li nucleus.

So what's the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus? Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014 atomic mass units (u). Because, each proton is about 1.007276 u, each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Calculating the mass:

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u
3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u
Total: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u. 

Wait, but that's without considering binding energy. The actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum because of the mass defect (binding energy). So the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 u.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check. The standard atomic weight for Li-6 is approximately 6.01410 atomic mass units. So the rest mass energy is m c², where m is 6.01410 u.

But wait, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So m c² = 6.01410 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6.0141 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.0141 *931.5 is about 13.16 MeV. So total is approximately 5589 +13.16 = 5602.16 MeV, which is 5.60216 GeV.

Wait wait, but that's the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m c². Gamma is approximately 3.5714. So E = 3.5714 * 5.60216 GeV.

Calculating that: Let's compute 3.5 *5.602 = 19.607 GeV. Then 0.0714 *5.602 ≈ 0.402 GeV. So 19.607 +0.402≈20.009 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, but wait, perhaps my approximation is too rough. Let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - v²/c² again. v=0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 -0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Now, the rest mass energy m c². Let me compute it precisely. Li-6 has an atomic mass of about 6.01400 u. 1 u is 931.494 MeV/c². So m c² = 6.01400 * 931.494 MeV.

Compute that: 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV. 0.01400 *931.494 ≈13.0409 MeV. So total is 5588.964 +13.0409 ≈5602.0049 MeV, which is 5.6020049 GeV.

Now multiply by gamma: 3.57142857 *5.6020049 GeV.

Let me compute that step by step. Let's compute 5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285. 0.6020049 *3.57142857 ≈ let's compute 0.6 *3.5714 ≈2.1428. 0.0020049 *3.5714 ≈0.00715. So total is approximately 17.8571 +2.1428+0.00715 ≈20.007 GeV.

So about 20.007 GeV. Hmm, but the options given are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419. So 20.007 is close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps I made some approximation errors.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass isn't exactly 6.014 u. Let me double-check the atomic mass of Li-6. Maybe the exact value is a bit different.

Another approach: the exact value of the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01410 atomic mass units. So 6.01410 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

6.01410 *931.494 = ?

6 *931.494 = 5588.964

0.0141 *931.494 = let's compute 0.01 *931.494=9.31494, 0.0041 *931.494
