Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the position, none are found outside x=1 to x=3. So they all are between 1 and 3.

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. I remember that wave functions must satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because probabilities have to add up to 1.

Wait, but the wave function here is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a complex function. So the absolute square would be the modulus squared. Let's think.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is a complex number with real part (a / sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part (-0.5). The modulus squared is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (-0.5)^2 ].

Wait, no, wait. The modulus squared of a complex number z = z_real + z_imag * i is (z_real)^2 + (z_imag)^2. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, the wave function in quantum mechanics must be square-integrable, meaning the integral of |ψ(x)|² over all x where the particle exists must equal one. But in this case, the particle exists only between x=1 and x=3.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So let's compute that.

|ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this into two integrals:

Integral of a²/(1+x) from 1
