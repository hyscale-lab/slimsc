Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I think this looks familiar. Oh right, this is a density matrix for a mixed state. Because when you have a completely mixed state for a qubit, it's the average of the identity matrix divided by 2. Because for a qubit, the identity matrix is 2x2, so dividing by 2 gives a density matrix that's maximally mixed.

Wait, another thought. The state |0><0| is a projector, same with |1><1|. So adding them together, that's (|0><0| + |1><1|), which is actually the identity matrix for a qubit. Because for a 2x2 system, |0> and |1> form an orthonormal basis. So |0><0| + |1><1| equals I, the identity matrix. So ρ becomes (1/2) * I.

Density matrices live in the space of Hermitian matrices, right? Each density matrix can be represented as a point in this space. For a qubit, the space is three-dimensional because the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix with certain constraints. Oh, right, the density matrix must be positive semi-definite and trace one. Also, it's a Hermitian matrix, which for 2x2 matrices has three real parameters.

So, how do we represent a density matrix in terms of its coordinates in this space? I think it's similar to the Bloch sphere representation, but perhaps in a different coordinate system. Wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, but density matrices describe mixed states too. So maybe the parametrization is different.

I remember that any 2x2 density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So any density matrix can be expressed as (I + r · σ)/2, where r is a vector (rx, ry, rz), and σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. The vector r is the Bloch vector, but wait, for a pure state, |r| is 1, making it a point on the Bloch sphere. For mixed states, |r| is less than 1, so the point is inside the sphere.

Let me write this out. ρ can be expressed as (I + rx σx + ry σy + rz σz)/2. So when I compare this to our given ρ, which is (I)/2, that would imply that rx, ry, and rz are all zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which matches our ρ.

So the Bloch vector r would be (0, 0, 0). But wait, the options given don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That would be the origin in the qubit space. So that must be the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the general form of a density matrix for a qubit. A general 2x2 density matrix can be written as:

ρ = [[a, b],
     [c, d]]

With a + d = 1 (trace condition), and a, d >=0, etc. Also, for a mixed state, ρ isn't a projector, it's a convex combination.

In our case, ρ is (I/2), so each diagonal element is 1/2, and the off-diagonal elements (b and c) are zero. So:

a = d = 1/2, b=0, c=0.

But how does this translate into Bloch vector components? The Bloch vector components are:

rx = (ρ_{01} + ρ_{10})/2
ry = (ρ_{01} - ρ_{10})/(2i)
Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the expectation values. Another approach is to note that the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector components. The relation is:

ρ = (I + rx X + ry Y + rz Z)/2,

where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices. So expanding this, we get:

ρ = [ [ (1 + rz)/2, rx - i ry)/2 ], 
      [ (rx + i ry)/2, (1 - rz)/2 ] ]

Comparing this to our given ρ, which is:

ρ = [ [1/2, 0], 
      [0, 1/2] ]

So each element must match. Let's see:

The (1,1) element is (1 + rz)/2 = 1/2 → (1 + rz) = 1 → rz = 0.

The (2,2) element is (1 - rz)/2 = 1/2 → same result, rz=0.

The off-diagonal elements: rx - i ry = 0 → rx = 0, ry =0.

So rx=0, ry=0, rz=0 → r=(0,0,0). That's the origin.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. A general 2x2 density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \vec{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), the off-diagonal elements are zero, and the diagonal elements are both \( \frac{1}{2} \). Comparing this to the general form:

1. The (1,1) element gives \( \frac{1 + r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \), which implies \( r_z = 0 \).
2. The (2,2) element gives \( \frac{1 - r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \), which also implies \( r_z = 0 \).
3. The off-diagonal elements give \( r_x - i r_y = 0 \), which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector \( \vec{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the origin in the qubit space. This matches option C.

Answer: C
