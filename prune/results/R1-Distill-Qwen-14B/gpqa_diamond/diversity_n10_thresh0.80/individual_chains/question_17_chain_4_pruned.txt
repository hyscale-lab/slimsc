Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, so I don't think I need to worry about that complicating things. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so maybe some constants are given at that temperature, like the K value.

The K given is K_Ca-EDTA = 5x10^10. I remember that K usually represents the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So Ca^2+ and EDTA combine to form Ca-EDTA^2- or something like that. Right, the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−.

The problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. Since it's a 1:1 complex (stochiometric), each mole of Ca-EDTA gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

Wait, but wait. No, not exactly. Because in the complex, the calcium is bound by EDTA. So the dissociation would be CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−. So the K for this reaction is K_Ca-EDTA.

So K is the product of [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] divided by [CaEDTA²−]. Since the solution is 0.02 M of the complex, and assuming that EDTA is in excess or not? Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

When you have a solution of the complex, like CaEDTA²−, it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's say x is the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− that dissociate at equilibrium.

Wait no, no. If the complex dissociates, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So if the complex is 0.02 M, and some x dissociates, then:

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute, no. That's only true if the solution doesn't have any added EDTA. Because EDTA might already be present. But the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that's all the EDTA present—like, the solution is prepared by dissolving the complex, not by adding Ca²+ and EDTA separately.

So, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is x, then:

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x

But wait, wait. No, wait. No, because if the complex dissociates, the EDTA comes from the complex. So the only source of EDTA^4− is the dissociation of the complex. So initial EDTA is zero? No, wait.

Wait, no. No, the complex is the only source of EDTA. Because if the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, then the initial [EDTA^4−] is zero. So when it dissociates, all EDTA comes from the complex.

So, the problem is that the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−. So initially, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are zero. As it dissociates, some x comes off.

So the equilibrium expressions are:

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4−] = x

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x

Then, the formation constant K is given by:

K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA²−] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 - x) = 5e10

Hmm. But considering K is so large (5e10), which is a very large number, the denominator (0.02 -x) is going to be very small. Because K is high, it means the reaction favors the formation of the complex, so very little dissociation. Wait, no. Wait, formation constant K is for the formation of the complex. So for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−, K is 5e10. So the larger K, the more the complex forms. So in this case, the solution of the complex will dissociate only a tiny amount.

So in the expression x²/(0.02 - x) = 5e10, since K is so big, the denominator must be very small. So 0.02 - x must be approximately zero, but that can't be. Wait, no, no. Wait, the formation constant is K = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]). So the K is actually 5e10, which is very high, meaning the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal. So x will be very small compared to 0.02.

So, assuming that x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.

So the equation becomes x² / 0.02 ≈ 5e10 → x² ≈ 5e10 * 0.02 → 5e10 * 2
