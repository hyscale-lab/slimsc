Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Hmm, that's 6.59e-7 eV. Approximately 7e-7 eV. 

Now for the second state, Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J.
Convert to eV: 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV ≈ 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, but when we consider the energy difference between E1 and E2, the uncertainty in their energy difference would be the sum of their individual uncertainties, right? Because both states have their own uncertainties. So ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So ΔE_total ≈ (6.59e-7 + 6.58e-8) eV. Let me compute that. Well, 6.59e-7 is 6.59e-7, and 6.58e-8 is about 0.658e-7. So adding them gives approximately 7.248e-7 eV. 

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this sum for them to be distinguishable. So ΔE > 7.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 7e-7, so not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, nope.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 7e-7 eV. So this would be sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00001 eV → less than 1e-7 eV, so not enough.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might mix up the exponents. Let me recalculate the ΔE for each state.

Wait, no, I did that correctly. First state's ΔE was about 6.59e-7 eV, second about 6.58e-8 eV. So the sum is about 7.25e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than that.

So looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 7e-7. So it's a possible answer.

Wait, but wait, wait a minute. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of ħ/(Δt). Because sometimes the formula is given as ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), which would halve the uncertainty. Let me check that.

Oh right, the precise formula is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). So the uncertainty is ħ/(2Δt). So I had used ħ/Δt, which would be twice as much. So I need to correct that.

So let me recompute the uncertainties.

For E1, Δt1 =1e-9 s.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2Δt1) = (1.055e-34)/(2*1e-9 s) = 5.275e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.275e-26 /1.602e-19 ≈3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, E2 has Δt2 =1e-8 s.

ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2Δt2) = (1.055e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.275e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.275e-27 /1.602e-19 ≈3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 100e-6, which is way bigger than 3.6e-7.

Wait, but 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7 (which is 0.00000036 eV). So the energy difference in option C is way larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV, so it would be easily distinguishable.

Options A and B are way smaller than 3.6e-7. Option D is 1e-8, which is smaller than 3.6e-7. So only option C is bigger, so option C is the correct answer.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the energy difference required for the two quantum states to be clearly distinguishable, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \(\Delta E\) is the energy uncertainty, and \(\Delta t\) is the lifetime of the state. Rearranging, the energy uncertainty for each state is:

\[
\Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
The reduced Planck constant is \(\hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\).

1. For the first state with \(\Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s}\):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \geq \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. For the second state with \(\Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s}\):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \geq \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
   \]

### Step 2: Total energy uncertainty
The total energy uncertainty for distinguishing the two states is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference must be greater than \(3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}\). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \(10^{-9} \, \text{eV}\):** \(10^{-9} < 3.62 \times 10^{-7}\), too small.
- **B) \(10^{-11} \, \text{eV}\):** \(10^{-11} < 3.62 \times 10^{-7}\), too small.
- **C) \(10^{-4} \, \text{eV}\):** \(10^{-4} > 3.62 \times 10^{-7}\), sufficient.
- **D) \(10^{-8} \, \text{eV}\):** \(10^{-8} < 3.62 \times 10^{-7}\), too small.

### Final Answer:
The energy difference must be at least \(10^{-4} \, \text{eV}\) to clearly distinguish the two states.
