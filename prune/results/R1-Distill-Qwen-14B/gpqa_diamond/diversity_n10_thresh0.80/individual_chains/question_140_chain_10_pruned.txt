Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. Okay, let's try to identify each component. I'll start by thinking about what each part could be.

First, the reaction of X with Y. Violent reactions could be things like a metal reacting with an acid, or perhaps something like a Grignard reaction. Wait, but Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds, but I'm not sure if that fits here.

The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So, let's think about molecules where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Common gases: H2? No, H has 1 proton, but in H2, each H has 0 neutrons. So 1 proton each and 0 neutrons each. Hmm, that's not equal. Wait, maybe it's a heavier gas. Let me think: CO2? No, that's a gas, but the molecule has 22 protons (12 from C, 16 from 2 O) and 22 neutrons? Wait, no. Let me calculate. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's carbon-12), oxygen has 8 each. So for CO2: each O has 8 protons, so total protons in the molecule would be 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons would be 6 (C) + 8*2 (each O is 8, so O has 8 neutrons if it's O-16). So 6 + 16 (from O) = 22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W could be CO2. But wait, does CO2 have the same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule? Wait, each molecule's total protons would be 6 (C) + 8*2 (O) = 22. The total neutrons would be 6 (C) + (8 * 2) (O) = 22. So yes, that's equal. So W is CO2.

Wait, but when Y is a liquid. CO2 is a gas, but under certain conditions, maybe it's supercritical? Or perhaps Y is something else. Alternatively, maybe W is another gas. Let me think of other possibilities. What about water? H2O. Protons: 2 H (each 1) + 8 O = 10. Neutrons: H has 0 each, O has 8 each. So 0 + 8 = 8. 10 vs 8, not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Another option: maybe it's carbon monoxide, CO. Protons: 6 + 8 =14. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 8 (O) =14. So yes, that would work. But wait, CO is a gas, but under what conditions? Hmm. So W could be CO.

Wait, but the question says the molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So which gases fit that?

Let me list possible gases where the molecule's total protons equal the total neutrons.

- H2: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.
- O2: 16 protons, 16 neutrons (each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons; 2 O atoms: 16 each, so protons 16, neutrons 16*2? Wait, no. Wait, in O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So molecule has 16 protons, and 16 neutrons (8 per O * 2). So yes, protons and neutrons are both 16. So O2 is a possibility. So W could be O2.

Wait, but O2 is molecular oxygen. Does that fit the rest of the scenario?

Alternatively, maybe it's another gas. Let's think about nitrogen (N2). Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (assuming N-14, which is common). So N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That also fits.

So possible W is O2 or N2 or CO2 or CO or maybe something else.

Hmm, but the problem also mentions that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a compound that includes an isotope, like deuterium or something else.

Let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce W, G, and B. So perhaps it's a decomposition reaction or a substitution.

Wait, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is a solid or crystalline solid at that temperature. What compounds have a melting point near 277 K? Maybe something like water (0 C), so that's too low. Hmm, 277 K is 4 C. So B could be something like sodium hydroxide? No, that's a solid at room temp. Or maybe ammonium chloride? No, melting point around 327 K. Wait, maybe it's something like glucose? No, that's higher. Alternatively, maybe it's something like a salt that's a byproduct.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. Let's think about metals. For example, sodium has a melting point around 371 K, which is higher than 277 K. Hmm. Wait, what about something else. Wait, 277 K is about 4 C. So perhaps B is a solid that's just above freezing. Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? No, that's higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonate or hydroxide.

Wait, perhaps B is a carbonate. But more importantly, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two oxygen atoms. Let me think about what that could be.

Keto acids are like things with a ketone group and a carboxylic acid. For example, acetoacetic acid or something similar. When they react with something, perhaps a Grignard reagent, which is an organometallic compound, like an alkyl magnesium bromide. Grignard reagents react with ketones to form secondary alcohols, but perhaps when reacting with a keto acid, which is a carboxylic acid with a ketone group, the reaction could form something else.

Wait, wait. But I thought X is a reagent used in organic chemistry, like a Grignard reagent. Oh, but Grignard reagents are typically RMgX, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. They react with carbonyl compounds.

Wait, if X is a Grignard reagent, then when it reacts with a keto acid (which has both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group), the reaction could be something like the Grignard attacking the ketone part, adding to the carbonyl
