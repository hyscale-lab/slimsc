Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I need to find the energy of the collider so that the nucleus moves at that speed. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, lithium has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 maybe? Because Li usually has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6 (since 3+3=6). So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

I remember that the energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes in these problems, they might be referring to the kinetic energy. I'll need to check the formula again.

The formula for the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So when v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the gamma formula.

Let me calculate gamma first. So v is 0.96c, so v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Oh wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Let me calculate that exactly.

Wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 which is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, I should be accurate. Let me compute it more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) again. 0.96^2 is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest energy of the nucleus is the rest mass multiplied by c squared. But since energy is given in GeV, I'll need to find the rest mass of Li-6 in GeV/c².

Wait, but I don't remember the exact mass of Li-6. Maybe I can look up the atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using known values. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons
