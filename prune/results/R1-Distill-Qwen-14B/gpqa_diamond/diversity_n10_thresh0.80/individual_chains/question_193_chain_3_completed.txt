Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy question here. Hmm, it says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax and distance are related, right? I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So like, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. But wait, in what units? Oh, right, parallax is in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and vice versa.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. They want to know the trend per unit range of distance, r. So, we're looking for the relationship between the number of stars (N) and distance (r).

The given relation is N proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r (because parallax in parsecs is 1 over distance in parsecs), I can substitute that in. So plx = 1/r. Therefore, 1/plx would be r. So, 1/(plx^5) would be (r)^5. So, N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, let me double-check that substitution. Plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5, which is 1/(r^5). So 1/(plx^5) is r^5. So yes, N ∝ r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r to the fifth power.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. But wait, why would that be the case? Because if parallax is inversely with distance, and the number is inversely with plx^5, that's a steep increase. So for each unit increase in distance, the number of stars goes up a lot.

Wait, another way to think about it: if you go from a distance r to r+dr, how does the number of stars change? The number per unit distance would be the derivative, maybe. But perhaps that's complicating things. Since the question is about how the number changes with distance, the proportional relation is N ∝ r^5, so the answer should be option B.


The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

Thus, the number of stars in the region increases with distance as \( r^5 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^5 \).

Answer: B
