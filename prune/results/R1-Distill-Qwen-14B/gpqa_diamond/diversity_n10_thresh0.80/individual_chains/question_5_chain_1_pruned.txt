Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator corresponding to a specific eigenvalue. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. The operator is denoted as P, and it's a vector operator, so it has components in the x, y, and z directions: Px, Py, Pz. The eigenvector is for an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The question is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalue equation is something like P · n |ψ> = ħ/2 |ψ>, where n is the direction vector. Since the operator is a vector, we're looking for an eigenvector in the direction determined by n.

But the given components of the operator are 2x2 matrices, and each of these matrices represents the respective component of P. So Px, Py, Pz are 2x2 matrices. So the operator P is a vector operator, and when you take the dot product with n, you get P · n = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n would be (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. So nx is sinθ, nz is cosθ, and ny is 0.

So, the operator P · n would be sinθ Px + 0*Py + cosθ Pz. Since Py is multiplied by zero, it doesn't contribute.

So the operator whose eigenvector we are seeking is (sinθ) Px + (cosθ) Pz. Let me write that down:

P · n = (sinθ)(Px) + (cosθ)(Pz)

Now, I need to construct this matrix. Let me get the expressions for each component:

From the question:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1],[1, 0]]

Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

So, substituting, P · n would be:

(ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix:

First, compute the matrices inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these two:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Multiply by (ħ/2):

So the matrix for P · n is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So now, the eigenvalue equation is:

( (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]] ) * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, the eigenvalue is given as ħ/2, so the equation is:

( (ħ/2) * M ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Where M is the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So we can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by ħ/2:

M |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], and we need to find its eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

Wait, because when M |ψ> = 1 * |ψ>, that's the eigenvalue equation
