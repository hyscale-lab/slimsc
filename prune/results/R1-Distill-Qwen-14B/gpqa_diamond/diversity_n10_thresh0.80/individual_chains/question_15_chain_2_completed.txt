Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was detected via the RV method. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

Wait, orbital period relates to the size of the orbit, right? Using Kepler's third law. But also, the host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radii. Interesting.

Transit probability is given by the formula: (R_p / R_s)^2, but I might be mixing that up. No, wait. The probability isn't exactly that. Let me think. The probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, no, the probability is more about the alignment. The chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits in front of the star.

I remember the formula for the probability of a transit is roughly (R_s / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, that can't be right. Oh right, the probability is (R_* / a), but actually, the exact formula is (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by some factor, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p + R_*)^2 / (a^2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula for the probability is (R_* / a). Let me think. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on as seen from Earth. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance because the planet has to pass within that radius for the transit to occur.

Wait, the transit probability (p) is approximately (R_*/a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet must pass within the star's disk for a transit to happen, and the area for that alignment is proportional to (R_*/a). But wait, that's more of an approximation. I think the actual probability is p = (R_* + R_p)^2 / (a^2), but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's roughly (R_*)^2 / a^2. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the probability is actually (R_* + R_p) / a, but again, R_p is negligible, so it's R_* / a. But wait, another way to think about it: the transit occurs if the planet's orbit's inclination is such that it crosses our line of sight. The area where this can happen is a circle with radius R_*, and the total possible area is a circle of radius a. So the probability is (pi R_*^2)/(pi a^2), which simplifies to (R_* / a)^2. So the transit probability is (R_* / a)^2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the required inclination is when the orbit's plane is within a certain angle. The area for a transit is when the planet's orbit is within a cone of a certain angle, not a circle. Oh, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up the formula, but since I can't, I'll have to rely on what I remember.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_*)^2 / a^2. So the closer the planet is to the star (smaller a) and the larger the star (larger R_*), the higher the transit probability.

So in the question, both stars have the same radius, so R_* is same for both. So a is the semi-major axis, which relates to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that a^3 = (G(M_* + M_p) * P^2)/(4π²). Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, it's approximately a^3 = (G M_* P^2)/(4π²).

So a is proportional to (M_* P^2)^(1/3).

Wait, because a^3 is proportional to M_* P^2, so a is proportional to (M_* P^2)^(1/3).

So let's compute a for each planet.

For Planet_1: M_*1 = 2 M_*2, since Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Also, Planet_1's period P1 is P2 / 3.

So a1 ~ (M_*1 * P1^2)^(1/3) = (2 M_*2 * (P2/3)^2)^(1/3) = (2 * M_*2 * P2² /9)^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M_*2 P2²)^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

What's (2/9)^(1/3)? Let's calculate that. 2 is about 0.222 times 9. Cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. So 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of that is around 0.6.63? Wait, 0.222 is 2/9, so (2/9)^(1/3) is approximately (2^(1/3))/(9^(1/3)) = 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 * a2.

Since transit probability is (R_* / a)^2, and R_* is same for both, the probability P for each planet is (R_* / a)^2.

So P1 = (R_* / a1)^2 = (1 / (0.605 a2))² ≈ (1.65)^2 = approx 2.72 (since 1/0.605 is about 1.65).

P2 = (R_* / a2)^2 = (1/a2)^2.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if a1 is smaller, then R_* /a1 is larger, so the probability is higher. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, but let's do this more accurately.

Compute a1 and a2.

a1 = (M1^(1/3) * P1^(2/3)) / (some constant factor) 

Similarly, a2 = (M2^(1/3) * P2^(2/3)) / same factor.

So the ratio a1/a2 = (M1/M2)^(1/3) * (P1/P2)^(2/3).

M1 = 2 M2, so that's (2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.

P1 = P2 /3, so (1/3)^(2/3) ≈ (1/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.4807.

So a1/a2 = 1.26 * 0.4807 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So the ratio of transit probabilities is (R_*/a1)^2 / (R_*/a2)^2 = (a2/a1)^2.

Because R_* is same, and a1 is 0.606 a2, a2/a1 is 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times P2's transit probability. So Planet_1 is preferred.

Wait, but the options don't have 2.7 exactly. Looking at the options:

Options:
A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.

So according to this, P1's probability is about 2.7 times higher than P2. So researchers would prefer Planet_1.

So the correct option is D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_*\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\(R_*\)), the key factor is the semi-major axis (\(a\)).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left(M_* P^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

where \(M_*\) is the mass of the host star, and \(P\) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- \(M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2}\) (Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star).
- \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{*,1}}{M_{*,2}}\right)^{1/3} \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(2\right)^{1/3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Calculating each term:
- \(\left(2\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.26\)
- \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{2/3} \approx 0.4807\)

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 1.26 \times 0.4807 \approx 0.606
\]

This means \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \(\left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2\). Since \(R_*\) is the same for both stars, the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx (1.65)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Given that Planet_1 has a much higher transit probability, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

### Final Answer:
