Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

So, the question involves a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is close to that of water (which is 273 K, so maybe B is something similar but a bit higher). 

Another clue is that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Hmm, X might be something like a base or a nucleophile.

Let me break down the clues one by one.

First, the reaction between X and Y. The gas W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Wait, gas W's molecule has same protons and neutrons. Let me think: if a molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, each atom in the molecule would contribute. But perhaps it's a diatomic gas. Let's think of possible gases. For example, CO2 is triatomic but not diatomic. Wait, maybe something like H2O? No, because H2O has 10 neutrons in totalâ€”H has 1, O has 8. Wait, perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like O2? No, because O is O^16, which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons each. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons, but that's not matching. Wait, wait, perhaps the molecule has each atom having the same number of protons and neutrons. Like, maybe CO? Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's the isotope ^12C), and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (^16O). Wait, but CO has a molecule with C and O. Each atom: C has 6 p and 6 n, O has 8 p and 8 n. So the molecule as a whole would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. But that would mean the molecule's total protons plus neutrons are equal. Oh wait, the question says the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So total protons = total neutrons for the molecule.

Let me think: H2O. H2O has 2 H atoms (each with 1p, 0n) and 1 O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 0 +8 =8. Not equal. So that's not it.

What about CH4? No, 5 H's, so 5p for H and 6p for C (maybe), but not sure.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like NH3? No, that's a liquid at STP. Wait, what about CO2? No, that's a gas, but CO2 has 2 O's and 1 C. Total protons: 2*8 (O) +6 (C)
