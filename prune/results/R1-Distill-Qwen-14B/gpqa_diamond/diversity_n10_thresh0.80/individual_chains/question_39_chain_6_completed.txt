Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we've got 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the value of 'a' from the options provided.

Wait, wave functions in quantum mechanics need to satisfy certain conditions. Oh right, the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

But in this case, the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So the integral should be from 1 to 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is a complex number. The general form is ψ(x) = something real + something times i. So the complex part here is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, or is it? Actually, when you have a complex number written as A + Bi, A is the real part and B is the coefficient of the imaginary part. So in this case, ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5)i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

But wait, the wave function typically can be complex, but the probability density is given by |ψ(x)|², which is ψ*(x) ψ(x). So I need to compute this modulus squared. Let's compute that.

Let me write ψ(x) as ψ_real + i * ψ_imaginary. So ψ_real is a/sqrt(1+x), ψ_imaginary is -0.5.

The modulus squared is (ψ_real)^2 + (ψ_imaginary)^2. So [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because (i * ψ_imaginary)^2 is (ψ_imaginary)^2, but wait, no, actually, when you multiply ψ*(x) and ψ(x), the cross terms vanish because one has +i and the other has -i. Wait, no, let's think:

ψ*(x) = ψ_real - i * ψ_imaginary.

So ψ*(x) ψ(x) = (ψ_real + i ψ_imaginary)(ψ_real - i ψ_imaginary) = (ψ_real)^2 + (ψ_imaginary)^2.

So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

But that seems a bit complicated because the modulus squared depends on both a and x. Now, the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of this modulus squared dx equals 1.

So the integral ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Wait, let me write that out:

Integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Hmm, that's the equation we need to solve for 'a'.

Let me split the integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x).

So evaluating from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that numerically.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

So a² ≈ 0.7202.

Then a is the square root of that, so sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to this value.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my steps.

1. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

2. The modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

3. The integral from 1 to 3 of this must equal 1.

4. So the integral becomes a² ∫1/(1+x)dx from 1 to3 + 0.25*(3-1) = 1.

5. The first integral is a² ln(2), as calculated.

6. So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

7. a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

8. a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So option B.

But wait, let me think again. Could I have made a mistake in the modulus squared?

Wait, the modulus squared is |a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i|^2.

Which is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + [0.5]^2.

Wait, because when you have (a + ib), the modulus squared is a² + b².

So that part was correct.

Wait, another thing: the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when you compute the modulus squared, you have (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, correct.

Because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you square the modulus, you add the squares.

So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

So the integral is correct.

So the calculation is as done before, leading to a ≈0.8485, so 0.85 is the closest option, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by ensuring the wave function is normalized. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the region where the particle exists (from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \)) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First integral**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
