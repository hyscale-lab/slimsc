Okay, so I have this question about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me the IR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. I need to match these observations with the possible formulas given: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR: the broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak might suggest a hydrogen-bonded O-H, which could be in a carboxylic acid or maybe an ester. Oh, but wait, esters usually have a carbonyl as well.

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. These are in the range for carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1700 is typical for maybe a ketone or ester, while 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Wait, the 1650 might also be from an aromatic ring with conjugation, but that's more around 1600 maybe. Alternatively, it's a carbonyl with some electron-withdrawing groups, making it stronger.

Next, the Â¹H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the molecule has an alkene group. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond.

Looking at the mass spectrum: a fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about that. 45 is a common mass. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, if the molecule is something like an ester with a propenoate group, maybe the fragment is a CH2COO- group, but wait, 45 could be (CH3CO)+, but that would be 43. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a CH2CH2O group, or perhaps a ketene ion? Hmm, wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular ion for methyl acetate? Wait, methyl acetate is C3H6O2, which has a molecular weight of (12*3)+(6)+(16*2)= 36+6+32=74. No, that's not right. Oh wait, 45 could be (CH3COO- doesn't add up). Alternatively, maybe it's the fragment of an ester losing the R group.

Wait, 45 would be the mass for a fragment like (CH2CH2O) or perhaps a ketone group. Let me think about possible structures. If the molecule is an ester with a conjugated double bond, maybe something like methyl acrylate. The formula for acrylate is C3H4O2. But wait, if the compound has a larger structure... Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a larger group.

Wait, another approach: The possible formulas. Let me list them:

A) C6H12O2: Degree of unsaturation? Let's calculate. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X here, so for C6H12O2: (2*6 + 2 -12 - 0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, in the NMR there are vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So that might account for one. But wait, let me check. For C6H12O2: 6 carbons, 12 H: Degrees of unsat. = (2*6 + 2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. But what about the IR? The IR shows two carbonyl peaks, which would be two double bonds, so that's two degrees of unsaturation. But the formula has only one. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe that's not the right formula.

Let me check the others.

Option B: C6H10O. So do of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. But the IR has two carbonyl peaks, so that's two double bonds, which would fit. But wait, the molecular formula is C6H10O. So if it's an ester, which is O in the formula, but an ester would have two oxygen atoms. So maybe B isn't an ester. Hmm, perhaps it's a ketone and
