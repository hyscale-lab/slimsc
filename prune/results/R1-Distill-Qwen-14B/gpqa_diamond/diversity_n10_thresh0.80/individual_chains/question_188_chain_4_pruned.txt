Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem states that it's a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal and all angles equal, so a = b = c, and α = β = γ. In this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a' in crystals, right? So, a = 10 Å.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the plane's Miller indices vector, multiplied by the reciprocal of the lattice constant, but adjusted for the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, the formula I think I need is the interplanar distance formula for a crystal. For a cubic system, it's simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But rhombohedral isn't cubic, so I need the more general formula. I think the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh) \cos \alpha} }

Wait, no,
