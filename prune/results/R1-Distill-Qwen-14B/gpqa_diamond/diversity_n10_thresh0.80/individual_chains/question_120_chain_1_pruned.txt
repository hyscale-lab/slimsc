Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, first things first, what's parallax? Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky as observed from Earth over the course of a year. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, right! Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger plx is closer to us.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the same number of stars per cubic parsec, say, throughout the universe (well, in the part we're considering).

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how many stars fall into a certain range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, and how that number changes with plx.

Hmm, so I need to relate the number of stars in a given parallax range to the actual distribution. Let's think about the geometry here. Parallax is related to distance, right? The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d = 1/plx. So higher plx means closer.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (let's say n stars per cubic parsec) is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume. But wait, how does this translate into parallax?

Let me think about a spherical shell of stars at a distance d. The thickness of the shell would be dr, and the volume would be 4π d² dr. But since we're considering parallax, let's express everything in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, dr is the change in distance. So let's compute dr in terms of plx. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, because if plx increases, d decreases. So the negative sign shows that as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering volume, we'll take the absolute value.

So the volume of a thin shell is 4π d² dr. Substituting d = 1/plx, d²
