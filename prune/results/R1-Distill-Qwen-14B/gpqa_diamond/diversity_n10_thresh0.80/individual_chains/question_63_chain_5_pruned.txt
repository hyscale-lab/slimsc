Okay, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next lowest energy state. So, I guess this is about energy transitions in molecules—like when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to a higher energy state.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, so the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is an extension of the rigid rotor model. In the rigid rotor, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so it's more like a vibration as well. Oh right, because in reality, bonds can stretch a bit.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels account for both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state, I suppose. But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either change vibrational or rotational states. Oh wait, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would probably be the next vibrational state, since vibrational energy is higher than rotational. Or wait, no—rotational energy levels are closer together, so maybe the next state is a vibrational level.

Wait, actually, the
