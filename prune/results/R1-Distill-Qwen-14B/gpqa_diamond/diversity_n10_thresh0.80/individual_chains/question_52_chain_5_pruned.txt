Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll walk through my thoughts step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. The observation says that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is spotted. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels in a star's photosphere can be explained using the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann factor is (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. So the effective temperature is lower when spots are present. So the star's overall temperature is lower, which affects the ratio.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 decreases when there are spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower, right? Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The ratio observed is n1/n2, and when spots are present, this ratio decreases. So when it's not spotted, the ratio is higher.

Wait, the question says the ratio of the number of
