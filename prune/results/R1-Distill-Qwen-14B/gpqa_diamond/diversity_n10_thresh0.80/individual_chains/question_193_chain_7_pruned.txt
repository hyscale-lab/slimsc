Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So parallax (plx) = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, actually, I think the formula is that the distance d is equal to 1 divided by parallax. So d = 1/plx. Yeah, that makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. They're asking about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So maybe I need to find how N (number of stars) depends on distance r.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d. So substituting plx in terms of d into the equation.

So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but wait that would mean N increases with d^5, which seems a lot. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, but does it mean per unit distance?

Wait, no. Because parallax is 1/d. So if you have a region of the sky, you're looking at stars at a certain distance (d). But the number of stars you observe depends on the volume, right? Wait, no, wait—the problem seems to be relating the number of stars directly to parallax. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should express N in terms of d. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, since N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Because plx is 1/d, the equation becomes N = k * (d)^5.
