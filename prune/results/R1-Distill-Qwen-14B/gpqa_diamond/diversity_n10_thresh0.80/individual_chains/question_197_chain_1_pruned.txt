Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find out what the product is based on the given IR and NMR data. The options are A to D.

First, I should think about what reaction involves red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right! That's the Hunsdiecker reaction, isn't it? Or wait, maybe it's more about the elimination. Wait, another possibility: when alcohols react with red phosphorus and HI, it's the formation of an alkyl iodide via substitution. Or maybe it's the reaction where a hydroxyl group is replaced by iodine. Oh wait, wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are often used in the substitution of alcohols to form alkyl iodides. So the compound X must have a functional group that can react with HI under those conditions.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks are in the regions of 3400â€“2500, which can indicate O-H stretching (like in a carboxylic acid or alcohol), or maybe an -NH group, but I don't think that's the case here. Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak, probably from a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound has an aromatic ring.

The NMR data: let's break it down. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, and broad could mean it's exchanging, like an acidic proton. Wait, but if it's an aldehyde, then the IR should show a peak around 1720 for the carbonyl, so that fits. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid. The proton in a carboxylic acid is usually around 10-12 ppm, so the 10.5 could fit that. Also, the IR would have a broad O-H stretch, which would be
