Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to understand what it's asking.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. It's given that Ay is a 2x2 matrix represented as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and then determine which statement among the options is correct.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should write down the matrix for Ay. Let me compute that. Since c is h/(4π), and S is given, I'll multiply each element of S by c.

So, S matrix is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiplying each element by c, Ay becomes:

[ 0      (-i)*c ]
[ i*c     0   ]

So, substituting c = h/(4π), the matrix is:

[ 0        (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0       ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. Let's write that out.

The matrix Ay - λI would be:

[ -λ      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -λ     ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h)/(4π) * (-i h)/(4π) ] = λ² - [ (-i²) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ].

Wait, let's compute the minor. The determinant is (λ²) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Simplify the product: i * (-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So,

determinant = λ² - [ (h^2 / (16 π²)) * (1) ) ] 
So λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Wait, wait, wait. Because i times (-i) is -i² = 1. So the product is (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) = (i * (-i)) (h²/(16 π²)) )= (1)(h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. So λ² = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that calculation. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ]

So the first term is λ². The second term is (i)(-i) (h²/(16 π²)) = (i*(-i)) is 1, so second term is (h^2)/(16 π^2).
