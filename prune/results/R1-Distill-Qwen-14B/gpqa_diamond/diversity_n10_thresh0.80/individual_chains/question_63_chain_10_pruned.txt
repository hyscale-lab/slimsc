Okay, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule switching between energy states. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can be modeled as rigid rotors and harmonic oscillators, but this question mentions the rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both aspects. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon it absorbs to go to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it must transition to the next higher state. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's the next higher energy level, but what's the selection rule here?

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, each state is characterized by two quantum numbers: the vibrational quantum number ν and the rotational quantum number J. The fundamental state is when both ν and J are at their lowest values. The lowest vibrational state is ν=0, and the lowest rotational state is J=0 (or maybe J=1? No, I think J can be 0). So the fundamental state is ν=0, J=0.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher energy state. The next lowest energy state would probably be either increasing ν or J, but I'm not sure which contributes more. Wait, the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the smallest quantum jump.

I think in diatomic molecules, the energy levels for vibration and rotation are separate. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as (ν + 1/2) ħω, and rotational as (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The total energy is the sum of these two.

So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (ν=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be either ν=1 and J=0, or J=1 and ν=0. Which requires less energy?

Let me calculate the energies of these two possibilities. The vibrational energy for ν=1 would be (1 + 0.5) ħω = 1.5 ħω. The rotational energy for J=1 is (1*(1+1)ħ²)/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, which of these is smaller
