Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy states. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E the energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

In this case, since the energy difference is given, and we're comparing the same elements in two stars, I think the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) are the same for both stars because we're talking about the same transition in iron. So the ratio simplifies to n_i/n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

Wait, but wait. The problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think it's the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state. Let me clarify. Let's say in star_1, the population in an excited state is n_1, and in the lower state is n_0. Similarly for star_2, n_1' and n_0'.

The given is that n_1 (star1) is twice that of n_1' (star2). Wait, no, wait. No, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio (n_excited / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So star_1 has a higher ratio, which would imply higher temperature? Because higher temperature favors higher excitation.

Wait, let me be precise. The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, for the same energy level, the population ratio n_upper / n_lower is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2
