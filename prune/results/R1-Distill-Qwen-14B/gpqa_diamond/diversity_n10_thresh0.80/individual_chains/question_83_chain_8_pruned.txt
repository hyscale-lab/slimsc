Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, right.

First, let me read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So that's mixing equal volumes, so the concentration will change. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. Two points are asked: pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

The options are A to D. I'll need to calculate both pH values and match them.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Find the moles of acetic acid available initially, after dilution.
3. Determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% titration and the equivalence point.
4. For each of these points, compute the pH.

Starting with step 1: Dilution of acetic acid.

Original volume: 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L), concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (0.05 * 20) /40 = 1/4 = 0.025 M? Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025. Yes. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Step 2: Moles of acetic acid after dilution.

Molarity times volume. 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 0.025 *0.04 is 0.001. So we have 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of CH3COOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of CH3COOH. So the volume of NaOH needed is (moles) / (concentration) = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question also asks about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no: wait, the 25% refers to the titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 is 2.5 cm³.

So for each point, I'll find the moles of NaOH added, then determine the concentrations of the species in solution.

Let me tackle the two points one by one.

First: pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, this will neutralize 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate ion.

So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Moles after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate produced: 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution is 40 cm³ (original diluted solution) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ let me compute that.

0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M (approximately).

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0
