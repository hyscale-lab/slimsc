Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, I should remember what each of these symmetries means and how they apply to the SMEFT framework. I know that SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). So the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM.

Let's break down each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators must also respect this. They must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. So I'm pretty sure Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

2. **Poincare Symmetry**: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since the SM (and thus SMEFT) is a Lorentz-invariant theory, does it also automatically respect Poincare? Well, the generators of Poincare include momentum for translations. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. SMEFT is formulated in a way that maintains Poincare invariance because it's an effective field theory. Effective theories usually maintain the same symmetries as the underlying theory, right? So Poincare symmetry should be respected as well. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (and hence SMEFT) doesn't necessarily respect CP symmetry. For example, the SM has CP violation in the CKM matrix. So in SMEFT, operators can violate CP because the underlying theory does. So I don't think CP symmetry is a must. So option 3 is probably not correct.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry. I remember that all renormalizable theories respect CPT, as long as they have a Hermitian Hamiltonian. SMEFT is an effective field theory that respects all the symmetries of the SM. Therefore, CPT must be preserved. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but Poincare is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz. Because Poincare includes translations, but in the SMEFT setup, the operators are local and the theory is built in a
