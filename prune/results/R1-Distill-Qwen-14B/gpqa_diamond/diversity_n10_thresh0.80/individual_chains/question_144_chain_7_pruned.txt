Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Because the decay happens when the particle travels a certain distance before it breaks apart. So the formula should be something like distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and β is the velocity relative to the speed of light.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is approximately the inverse of the lifetime. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact relation. Oh, right, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should make sure about the units here. Since Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·seconds, I think. Let me recall: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So when I compute τ, I have to convert Γ into GeV to match the units.

Let me write down:

Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ_X = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, that calculation: 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is the same as 6.582/(0.32) * 1e-25, which is 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah, that's right.

Next, I need to find the velocity β of the particle. Since the particle is produced with energy E_X and mass m_X, I can use the relativistic energy equation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. So I can solve for p, the momentum.

E is given as 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Let me compute p.

p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / c² ?

Wait, no, the formula is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2. So rearranged, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc²)^2. So pc = sqrt(E^2 - (mc)^2) * c? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me write the equation:

E² = (p c)² + (m c²)².

So, solving for p c: p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 )

Then, p = sqrt( (E² - m² c^4 ) ) / c² ?

Wait, let me make sure. Let's not get into confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the Lorentz factor γ, and then find β from that.

Because, γ = E / (m c²). Since E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV, so E/(m c²) would be 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, but since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c²? Hmm, perhaps I should be careful with units, but I think since both E and m are in units where c is incorporated, dividing them gives a unitless γ.

So γ = E / (m c²) → but if E and m are in GeV and GeV
