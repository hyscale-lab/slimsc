Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters. But wait, rhombohedral crystals are a bit tricky because all the angles are the same, right?

The given data is: interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. The plane is (111). So I think the formula I need is the interplanar distance formula for a general crystal system, which is given by d_{hkl} = (a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)) ), wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )). Or is it the other way around with the angles? Because in the case of a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so cosines are zero, and it simplifies to a/sqrt(h² + k² + l²), which I'm familiar with.

But in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so α = β = γ, which is 30 degrees here. So cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.866. So let's plug in the values.

The plane is (111), so h, k, l are all 1. So h² + k² + l² is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Now the cross terms: 2*(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α). Since all angles are 30 degrees, and all are same, so each term is cos(30). So it's 2*( (1*1)*0.866 + (1*1)*0.866 + (1*1)*0.866 ). Let's compute that: each of the three terms is 0.866, so adding them gives 3 * 0.866 = 2.598. Multiply by 2, so 5.196.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196). Let me calculate sqrt(8.196). 8.196 is between 8.1 and 9, so sqrt(8.1) is about 2.846, sqrt(8.196) is a bit higher. Let me compute 2.86^2 = 8.1796, 2.86^2 is 8.1796. 2.86^2=2.86*2.86. 2*2=4, 0.8*2=1.6, 0.6*2=1.2, 0.8*0.8=0.64. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.
