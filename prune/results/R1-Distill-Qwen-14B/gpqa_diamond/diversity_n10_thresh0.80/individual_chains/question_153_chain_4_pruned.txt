Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me about the Michael reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what the Michael reaction is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, and this creates an enolate intermediate, which then gets protonated.

Looking at the question, there are three parts (A, B, C) each with their own reactions. The options give possible products for each, so I need to figure out each reaction's outcome step by step.

Let's start with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ A.

Wait, what's dimethyl malonate? Oh right, it's (CH3COO-)2CH-. It's a diester that can act as a nucleophile, right? And methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So in the Michael reaction, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the beta carbon is the one attached to the COOCH3 group. Wait no, wait: in the acrylate, the structure is COOCH2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2? No, no, wait, the numbering. Let me think again. The acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, the substituent is at position 3. So perhaps it's CH2-CO-OCH3 with a substituent at the beta position? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate
