Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and then determine which of the given statements (A, B, C, D) is correct.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that when dealing with angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues are related to the angular momentum quantum numbers. For a muon, which is a lepton, the spin is 1/2, so the possible eigenvalues for the components of the spin operator should be ±ħ/2, but wait, here the operator is A_y, which is scaled by c.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The intrinsic angular momentum operator S for a spin-1/2 particle has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for its components. But in this problem, the operator A_y is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Let me compute c.

c = h/(4π). So, A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

But wait, what is S here? The matrix S given is:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

I think this is the Pauli matrix sigma_y, scaled appropriately. So, for the Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1. So if S is sigma_y, then the eigenvalues of S would be ±1.

Wait, no, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but S is a 2x2 matrix that's given here. Let me compute the eigenvalues of S.

Alternatively, maybe I don't need to find the eigenvalues of S, but rather of A_y. So let's compute A_y first.

Since A_y = c * S, and c is h/(4π), then each element of S is multiplied by c. So the matrix A_y would be:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So,

A_y = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of A_y, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

The matrix A_y - λ I is:

[[-λ, (-i h)/(4π)],
 [(i h)/(4π), -λ]]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [(-i h/4π)(i h/4π)].

Let's compute the determinant:

= λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Simplify (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant becomes λ² - (1 * h²/(16π²)) = 0.

So, λ² = h²/(16π²)
Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, let me compute that again. Wait, sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π), because sqrt(16) is 4 and sqrt(π²) is π.

Wait, no: sqrt(16 π²) is 4 π, right? Because (4 π)^2 = 16 π².

So sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) = h/(4 π).

So λ = ± h/(4 π) * (1/2)? Wait, no. Let me compute the determinant again more carefully.

Wait, the determinant is λ² - [ ( (-i)*(i) ) * (h/(4π))^2 ].

Wait, (-i)*(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - [1*(h²/(4π)^2)].

So determinant is λ² - [ (h/(4π) )^2 ] = 0.

So λ² = (h/(4π))^2 → λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no.

Wait, (h/(4π))^2 is (h²)/(16 π²).

So λ² = (h²)/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4 π) * (1/2) ?

No, wait. No, because sqrt( (h²)/(16 π²) ) is h/(4 π). Because sqrt(h²) is h, sqrt(16 π²) is 4 π.

So λ = ± [ h/(4 π) ] * (1/2) ?

No, wait, because sqrt( (h/(4π))^2 ) is h/(4π), which is the same as h/(4 π) * 1.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the equation is λ² = (h/(4π))^2.

So λ = ± (h/(4 π)).

Wait, that's it. So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So when we multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of A_y would be c*(±1) = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the real parts are ± h/(4π), and what about the imaginary parts? Well, h/(4π) is a real number, so the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but wait a second. That would suggest that the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. But looking at the options, none of them suggest that the eigenvalues are real. Let me check the options again.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh or ± something else? Wait, no, the options are a bit unclear.

Wait, looking back:

Option A says: "The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π."

But that can't be, because if the eigenvalues are real, then the imaginary part is zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I've confused S being a 2x2 matrix. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe S is a different scaling. Let me compute the matrix S and see.

Wait, the matrix S is:

0    -i

i     0

This is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±i, perhaps? Wait no, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices have trace zero and determinant -1. Let me compute the eigenvalues of S.

The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] are given by (a + d ± sqrt( (a-d)^2 + 4bc )) / 2.

So for S, a=0, d=0. So the trace is zero, so the eigenvalues are symmetric around zero. The product b*c is (-i)(i) = (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the eigenvalues are (0 ± sqrt(0 + 4*1 )) / 2 = ± sqrt(4)/2 = ±2/2 = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. So when we multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of A_y would be (h/(4π))*(1) and (h/(4π))*(-1). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but that's real. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, and the imaginary parts are zero. So none of the options about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts make sense.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1.

Hmm, that's probably not correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Well, A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, and for spin-1/2 particles, A^2 would have eigenvalues ( ħ^2 * s(s+1) ), but wait, A is the operator for which component? Wait, A is a component, so A^2 would be the square of that component. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the square of the component operator is not the same as the square of the total angular momentum. Oh, wait, but the total angular momentum squared is S·S, which is S_x² + S_y² + S_z². But if A is a component, like S_y, then A^2 is S_y², which for an operator in spin-1/2 is ( (ħ/2)^2 ( ( (s(s+1)) ) ) )? Wait, no, wait. For a spin-1/2 particle, S^2 has eigenvalues ( (1/2)(1/2 + 1) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So if we have S_y², the eigenvalues of S_y² are ( (1/2)^2 ) ħ² = (1/4) ħ². Because each component of S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So S_y² would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2.

Wait, but the eigenfunctions of S_y are the eigenstates of S_y. So any eigenfunction of S_y is an eigenfunction of S_y² as well, because S_y² would be ( (S_y)(S_y) ), so acting on an eigenstate of S_y would just square the eigenvalue.

So option C says that the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 (which would be S_y^2), but not of Az.

Wait, but Az is the Z-component operator, S_z. So the eigenfunctions of S_y are not eigenfunctions of S_z, because S_y and S_z don't commute. Because [S_x, S_y] = iħ S_z, etc. So the eigenstates of S_y are not eigenstates of S_z.

So option C seems correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay (S_y) are eigenfunctions of A^2 (S_y squared), but not of Az (S_z).

Alternatively, let me look at the other options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the eigenfunctions would form a basis for the space, which is 2-dimensional since it's a 2x2 matrix. So the eigenfunctions would form an orthonormal basis, but whether they are the basis functions of Ay depends on what is meant by 'basis functions of the matrix operator'. I'm not sure, but perhaps this is correct.

Wait, but let's think again. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenfunctions. So any function in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions form a basis. So option D would be correct.

But wait, the question says, which of the statements is correct during the calculation.

So, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to reevaluate the eigenvalues. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Because according to the initial calculation, the eigenvalues of A_y are ± h/(4 π), which are real. But the options A and B talk about eigenvalues with both real and imaginary parts. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a second, perhaps I misapplied the scaling. Let me check again.

The matrix S has eigenvalues ±1, as determined earlier. So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of A_y are real. But looking at the options, none of them suggest that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps S is not the Pauli matrix. Wait, the matrix S is given as:

First row: 0 -i

Second row: i 0

Which is exactly the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y. So yes, its eigenvalues are ±1. So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Hmm, but looking at option B, the eigenvalues have imaginary parts. Which would only happen if the eigenvalues are complex, which would happen if the matrix had complex entries and the determinant led to complex roots. But in this case, the eigenvalues are real because the matrix is anti-hermitian? Or maybe hermitian?

Wait, wait. Matrix S is:

0  -i

i  0

Is this matrix Hermitian?

The conjugate transpose of S would be:

0  i

-i 0

Which is not the same as S. So S is not Hermitian. So its eigenvalues could be complex.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggests S has eigenvalues ±1, which are real. Let me recompute.

The characteristic equation for S is det(S - λ I) = 0.

So, for S:

row 1: 0 - λ, -i

row 2: i, 0 - λ

The determinant is (0-λ)(0-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( -i * i ) → λ² - ( (-i²) ) → λ² - ( -(-1) ) → λ² - (1) = 0. So λ² = 1 → λ=±1. So yes, eigenvalues are ±1, real.

So then the eigenvalues of A_y are ± c, where c = h/(4π). So real eigenvalues.

So the eigenvalues are real, so the options that say the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts are incorrect.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/4π. That would require eigenvalues like a + ib, but in our case, they're real. So A is wrong.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Same issue, eigenvalues are real so their imaginary parts are zero. So B is wrong.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2. Since A is Ay, A^2 would be Ay squared. Since Ay is a component, its square would be a different operator. But for spin-1/2, S_y^2 would have eigenvalues (s(s+1)) where s is 1/2? No, wait, S_y^2 would be (ħ/2)^2 for each eigenvalue, since S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and when squared, you get (ħ/2)^2.

Wait, but Ay is c S = (h/(4π)) S. So S has eigenvalues ±1, so Ay has eigenvalues ± h/(4π).

So when we compute Ay squared, it's (h/(4π))^2 * S^2. Since S^2 is identity matrix (because S is sigma_y, and sigma_y squared is I), then Ay^2 = (h^2/(16 π^2)) I.

So the eigenvalues of Ay^2 are (h^2/(16 π^2)) * 1, each. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of Ay^2, because Ay^2 is a multiple of the identity matrix, so it acts the same on any state. So every state is an eigenstate of Ay^2, regardless of being an eigenstate of Ay.

Wait, no. Wait, if Ay^2 is a multiple of the identity matrix, then all vectors are eigenstates of Ay^2. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of Ay^2.

But the question in option C is whether the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2. Since A is Ay, A^2 is Ay^2, which every state is an eigenstate of. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2.

But option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

So the first part is correct because all eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A^2. The second part is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay (S_y) are not eigenfunctions of Az (S_z) due to the commutation relations. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis for the 2-dimensional space. So any function can be expressed in terms of these eigenfunctions. So they are a basis for the operator's (Ay's) matrix representation. So option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis, but I'm not sure about the exact wording.

Wait, the statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the basis for the matrix is the eigenfunctions. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis, so D is correct.

But wait, which option is correct? I thought the correct statement would be C, but I'm now confused because D also seems correct.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, both C and D might be correct. But I need to think which is correct based on the calculation.

Wait, in the case of option C, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2, which is correct because A^2 (Ay^2) is a multiple of the identity matrix, so every vector is an eigenstate. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A^2. Also, they are not eigenfunctions of Az, because S_y and S_z don't commute.

So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form an orthonormal basis. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So I'll have to see which of these options are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is not necessarily correct because the basis functions are the eigenfunctions, but the matrix representation is in a particular basis. Hmm, but any Hermitian operator's eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space, so D is correct.

Wait, but the matrix Ay is given as 2x2, so it's acting on a two-dimensional space, and the eigenfunctions are vectors in this space. So the eigenfunctions form a basis, so D is correct.

So now I'm confused because both C and D seem correct. But let's look back at the problem statement.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one option is correct, but looking at the options, probably only one is correct.

Wait, the problem gives four options, and I'm to choose the correct one.

Let me re-examine option C. It says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

But as I thought earlier, since A^2 is a multiple of identity, any state is an eigenstate. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenstates of A^2. So the first part of option C is correct. The second part says they're not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct because S_y and S_z don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay's matrix. Since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct. But perhaps D is always correct, but that depends on the matrix.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis, but the matrix representation could be in a different basis. Wait, no, the matrix is given in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors may not be the same as the standard basis.

Wait, the matrix S is given as:

0  -i

i  0

Which is the Pauli Y matrix. Its eigenvectors are |+> and |-> states. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis for the operator's representation.

Hmm, but the basis of the operator's matrix is the standard basis, which for 2x2 matrices is typically |0> = [1,0]^T and |1> = [0,1]^T. The eigenvectors of S are in different directions, so perhaps they don't form the same basis as the standard basis.

Wait, so the eigenvectors of S (and thus A_y) are not the same as the standard basis vectors. So the eigenfunctions are new basis vectors, but they still form a basis for the space, so option D is correct.

But I'm getting stuck between C and D.

Wait, let me think about which statements are correct.

If option C is correct, then the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, which is correct because any set of eigenvectors for a Hermitian operator (assuming they are complete) form a basis.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form the basis for the matrix operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to compute the eigenvectors to see.

The eigenvalues of A_y are ± h/(4π). Let's find the eigenvectors.

For λ = h/(4π):

We have (A_y - λ I) v = 0.

Matrix becomes:

[ -h/(4π) , (-i h)/(4π) ] 

[ (i h)/(4π), -h/(4π) ]

So the equations are:

- (h/(4π)) v1 + (-i h/(4π)) v2 = 0

(i h/(4 π)) v1 - (h/(4 π)) v2 = 0

Dividing both equations by h/(4π):

- v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for λ = -h/(4π), the equations become:

(h/(4π)) v1 + (-i h/(4π)) v2 = 0 → v1 = i v2.

So the eigenvectors are [i, 1]^T and [-i, 1]^T.

Thus, the eigenfunctions are these vectors, which form a basis. So option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator's matrix.

But wait, the operator's matrix is 2x2, so any two linearly independent vectors would form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are two vectors, which are a basis.

So both C and D might be correct, but perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

C) The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, I think option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Wait, but in our case, A^2 is (h/(4π))^2 S^2. Since S^2 is identity matrix, A^2 is (h/(4π))² I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A^2, so the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2.

But the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az because S_y and S_z don't commute. So option C is correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis for the matrix operator.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely confident.

Let me think again about option D. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix operator is represented in the eigenbasis of Ay. So the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator's matrix. So D is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn between options C and D. 

But looking back, the eigenfunctions are the solutions, and the matrix representation of Ay is in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions may not align with the standard basis, so the matrix representation in the eigenbasis would be diagonal, but the given matrix is not diagonal, so the standard basis is different. Therefore, the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis in which the matrix is represented. So the statement in option D that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix operator is represented in the eigenbasis. But in this case, the matrix would be diagonal, but the given matrix is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], which is not diagonal, so the eigenbasis is not the same as the basis in which the matrix is given. So the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the operator's matrix, which is given in the standard basis. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

So that leaves option C as the correct statement.


The problem involves determining the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the 2x2 matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero. This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**, as both incorrectly suggest non-zero imaginary parts for the eigenvalues.

2. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the eigenvectors of \( S \), which are orthogonal and form a basis for the 2-dimensional space.
   - These eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the \( Z \)-component operator) because \( S_y \) and \( S_z \) do not commute. This supports the first part of **Option C**.

3. **Eigenfunctions and \( A^2 \):**
   - \( A^2 = (A_y)^2 = c^2 \cdot S^2 \). Since \( S^2 = I \) (the identity matrix), \( A^2 \) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.
   - Every vector is an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). This makes the first part of **Option C** correct.

4. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the 2-dimensional space. However, the matrix representation of \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis, not necessarily the eigenbasis.
   - Since the eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis vectors, the statement in **Option D** is not strictly correct.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). 

Answer: C
