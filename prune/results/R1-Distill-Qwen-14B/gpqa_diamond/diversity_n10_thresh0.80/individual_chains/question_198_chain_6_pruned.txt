Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. Higher β means more stable. The complexes here are Co with different numbers of SCN- ligands. The blue one is probably the one with two SCN- ions, but wait, I'm not sure. Wait, the options talk about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN-. So the blue complex is the one with two SCN- attached, I think. Or wait, maybe it's another one. Let me think. No, wait, in the case of Co(II), the common complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. The blue color is usually associated with the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, I think. Oh wait, no, another thought: the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue, and [Co(SCN)_3]^− is something else. I might be getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the dithiocyanato as the complex with two SCN- ions, so that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^(n) complex.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc. So β1 is for the first complex, which would be with one SCN- ion. So β1 = 9 is for [Co(SCN)]^+? Then β2=40 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(n?), β3=63 for [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and β4=16 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−? Wait, but the order can sometimes be tricky because higher β doesn't always mean more ligands. No, wait, β values usually increase with the number of ligands, but not always. So for each successive complex, the β increases up to a point.

Wait, no, in this case β3 is 63, which is higher than β2 (40), and β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That's interesting. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ions, because β3 is the highest. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm misremembering the structure. So Co(II) can form several complexes: [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^+, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. So each step adds a SCN- and changes the charge accordingly.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So the dithiocyanato is the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex. So that's the second complex, β2=40.

Wait, but sometimes the color can vary based on the ligand count. The blue might be the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− complex. But I'm not 100% sure. However, the question says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN- groups, so it's [Co(SCN)_2]^+.

So the problem is to calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex relative to all possible cobalt species in the solution.

The approach I remember is to calculate the distribution of each complex based on their stability constants and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^-.

The general formula for each complex is:

[CoL_n]^{m} = β_n [Co²+] [L]^n / (1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + ... + βn [L]^n )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formation of each complex step by step.

The Co²+ can form complexes by adding SCN- stepwise. Each step has its own stability constant.

The species present are:

1. Co²+ (free ion)
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^(n=2)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^− (n=3)
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^2− (n=4)

Each of these complexes has a stability constant βn, which is the formation constant for the n-th complex.

The formation constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, wait a minute. No, wait. Stability
