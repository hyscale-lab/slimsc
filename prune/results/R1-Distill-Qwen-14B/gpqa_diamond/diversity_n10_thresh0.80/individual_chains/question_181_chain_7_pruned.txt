Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains, and each branch produces neutrinos. 

First, I need to recall what the pp-III branch does. The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton cycle, which is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I branch leads to the production of deuterium, and then there are other branches, but pp-III specifically produces a helium-3 ion. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch involves reactions that lead to the production of He-3, which then combines with other He-3 ions to form He-4. 

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in each of these steps. The main neutrinos we detect are the electron neutrinos (νe) from the fusion processes. The different pp branches produce neutrinos at different energies. For example, the pp-I branch produces neutrinos when a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. But the pp-III branch's main neutrino emission is probably from something else.

I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are lower energy compared to others. Or wait, no, maybe the other way around. Wait, the neutrinos from the main pp process (like the dominant one) have energies around a few MeV, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the problem is about the flux ratio in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So we're looking at low-energy neutrinos here. Because 1 MeV is 1000 keV, so these are below 1 MeV.

I remember that the dominant source of solar neutrinos (about 90% or more) comes from the decay of boron-8, which is part of the pp-I branch. The neutrinos from boron-8 decay have energies around 1.4 MeV. But that's higher than the bands we're considering here, which are lower. So maybe the pp-III branch contributes neutrinos in the lower energy range.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The main pp process produces neutrinos in the MeV range. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos when beryllium-7 captures a proton to form boron-8, which then decays into carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is about 1.4 MeV. So band 1 and 2 are below that.

But then, what about the neutrinos from the pp-III branch? The pp-III branch involves reactions that produce helium-3. Let me think about the specific steps. The pp-III branch starts with a proton fusing with another proton to form a diproton, which then decays into helium-2 (He-2) and a positron. The He-2 then captures a proton to become Li-3, which then undergoes beta decay to become He-3. Wait, but does this branch emit neutrinos? I think that in the beta decay steps, neutrinos are emitted. So, for example, the decay of He-2 (which is a form of beryllium) would involve a positron and a neutrino.

Wait, but the beta decay would be something like:

He-2 (which is Be-4 with a proton instead of a neutron?) Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's get back to the basics.

In the pp-III branch, the reaction is p + p → ²H (deuterium) + positron + neutrino. Wait, no, that's the pp-I branch. Or wait, another possibility: the pp-III branch produces He-3 via a different pathway. So, the reaction might be p + p → ²He (which is He-2, which is unstable) + positron + neutrino. Then, He-2 captures a proton to become Li-3, which then beta decays to He-3 and emits another neutrino.

Wait, but each of these steps would emit a neutrino. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch would be from these processes. The neutrino from the He-2 decay (if that's what's happening) would have low energy. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are lower energy, perhaps in the keV range.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the number of neutrinos in the lower energy bands (like 700-800 keV) would decrease, but the higher bands (like 800-900 keV) wouldn't be affected as much. Or wait, maybe the pp-III branch's neutrinos are in a certain energy range. If the pp-III contributes a significant amount to the lower keV bands, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 1 more than in band 2.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band 1 flux to band 2 flux. If the pp-III branch's neutrinos are mostly in band 1, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 1 more than in band 2. So the ratio would decrease.

But I'm a bit shaky on the exact energies. Let me think about the energy of the neutrinos emitted in the pp-III branch steps.

The initial step in pp-III is p + p → ²He (He-2) + e+ + νe. The positron has an energy that's low, so the neutrino would have a low energy. The He-2 is unstable and quickly captures a proton to form Li-3, which then beta decays to He-3. The beta decay would be Li-3 → He-3 + e− + anti-neutrino (ν̄e). So each of these beta decays would emit a neutrino. The neutrinos emitted in these decays would have energies in the keV range, perhaps a few hundred keV.

So, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are lower energy, say around 0.5 MeV or so. So band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) both are in the same range as these neutrinos. So, if the pp-III branch produced most of the neutrinos in band 1 and maybe some in band 2, stopping it would reduce the flux in band 1 more than in band 2, making the ratio lower.

Wait, but how much do these two bands depend on the pp-III branch? Let's say that the main source of neutrinos in these bands is the pp-III branch. Then, if the pp-III stops, the flux in both bands would drop, but perhaps band 1 is more affected than band 2. Alternatively, maybe the distribution of neutrino energies from the pp-III branch is such that a larger fraction of them are in band 1 than in band 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch's neutrinos are lower energy, so band 1 is more affected. So if pp-III is the main source for band 1, then after it stops, the flux in band 1 would drop significantly more than band 2. So the ratio (flux band1 /
