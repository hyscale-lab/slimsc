Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are organized by their dimension. Each operator should respect certain symmetries, but I'm not exactly sure which ones are mandatory.

Let me think about what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry has to do with how fields transform under the Lorentz group, like rotations and boosts. If the theory doesn't respect Lorentz symmetry, things would be frame-dependent in a way that's probably not physical. So I'm guessing that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, the theory's predictions would vary with the observer's frame, which is not what we see in nature.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So does the SMEFT Lagrangian need to respect translations? Well, the SMEFT is usually considered in a way that it includes all possible operators that are consistent with the SM symmetries. The SM respects Poincare symmetry, so the SMEFT should as well. But wait, operators in SMEFT are local, so they should respect local symmetries, including Poincare. So Poincare symmetry must be respected. That makes me think options that include both 1 and 2 are possible.

Then there's CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM isn't CP-symmetric because of things like the CKM matrix in quark mixing, which leads to CP violation. But in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? I'm not so sure. I think that the operators can include terms that violate CP, depending on the basis you choose. Or wait, actually, the operators are classified in a way that they can be grouped into CP eigenstates. So maybe the operators themselves don't have to respect CP symmetry, but the Lagrangian as a whole should. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the operators are required to have a definite CP transformation behavior. But I'm not certain. Maybe CP isn't a symmetry that operators must respect; instead, the theory as a whole must have certain properties regarding CP conservation or violation.

CPT symmetry is another matter. CPT is a combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because the operator's terms are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory (since SMEFT is built on the SM, which respects Lorentz), they must respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, but what about the other symmetries. So, Lorentz (1) and CPT (4) are definitely required. What about Poincare (2)? Poincare includes translations, which are part of the space-time symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincare, and SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM, I think Poincare must also be respected. So that would mean options that include 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts about whether operators need to respect Poincare symmetry or not. Because Poincare symmetry includes translations which imply momentum conservation. But in effective field theories, perhaps the operators don't individually have to be translationally invariant, because the theory is built from local terms. Hmm, that might complicate things. Or perhaps the entire Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincare, which includes each operator.

Wait, no. Each term in the Lagrangian is a local operator, and each term must be Lorentz-invariant. But maybe Poincare is automatically respected because each term is a local operator, so when you vary the fields, the terms transform correctly. Or perhaps the SMEFT Lagrangian as a whole is Poincare-invariant, but individual operators don't necessarily have to respect it on their own. Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry and Poincare are related but separate. Lorentz is about local transformations, while Poincare includes global translations. So for a Lagrangian to be Poincare-invariant, it must be invariant under both Lorentz transformations and translations. But each operator is a local term, so perhaps the invariance under translations is handled by the fact that the Lagrangian is a sum of such terms, not the terms themselves. So maybe individual operators don't need to be translationally invariant because the overall Lagrangian is.

But I'm not sure if SMEFT requires individual operators to respect Poincare or just the total Lagrangian. If the question is about all operators respecting these symmetries, then it's possible that only Lorentz is required, while Poincare might be handled by the structure of the theory as a whole.

Wait, another approach: in the SMEFT, the operators are classified according to their transformation properties. Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, because the theory is Lorentz-invariant. But for Poincare, which includes translations, do the operators have to be invariant under that? Because operators like O(x) would transform under translations as O(x + a), but I think each operator must be a local term, which is fine because the Lagrangian is written as an integral over x of the operator. So individual operators don't need to transform in any specific way under Poincare, because the integral takes care of that. Therefore, perhaps operators don't have to explicitly respect Poincare symmetry beyond being part of a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian.

Wait, but the question says "must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT". So if the operator itself has to be invariant under Poincare, that's a different story. For instance, if you have an operator that isn't invariant under translations, then when you integrate it, the Lagrangian wouldn't be invariant under translations. But operators are local, so I think that each operator is only required to be a Lorentz scalar and can have any behavior under translations as long as the whole Lagrangian is invariant.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is the integral of the operator. If the operator isn't translationally invariant, the Lagrangian wouldn't be, either. So perhaps the individual operators must be translationally invariant as part of the Poincare symmetry. Hmm, no, because the operator is a function at point x, and when you translate the theory, you shift x. So the operator doesn't have to be invariant under x → x + a, because the integral would still be over the same region, just shifted. Wait, but the integral's measure is dx, which is invariant under translations. So the entire Lagrangian is invariant under translations if each operator is, because when you translate, each operator O(x) becomes O(x + a), and the integral ∫d^4x O(x+a) is the same as ∫d^4x O(x) due to the shift in variables. So maybe each operator doesn't need to be translationally invariant; instead, the Lagrangian is, because the operator is just shifted and integrated over a shifted x, which cancels out.

So perhaps the operators don't have to individually respect Poincare symmetry beyond being part of a larger Poincare-invariant Lagrangian.

But the question is about whether each operator must respect Poincare symmetry, not the Lagrangian as a whole. So if the operators themselves don't have to be Poincare invariant, then option 2 may not be a required symmetry for each operator. So perhaps only Lorentz (1), and CPT (4) are required symmetries for all operators.

Wait, but earlier I thought that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. So 1 is definitely required.

What about CPT symmetry? The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so by the CPT theorem, any Lorentz-invariant quantum theory must respect CPT symmetry, except in some cases where the theory is not consistent (like when there's a net baryon or entropy number). But in the SMEFT, which is a low-energy effective theory, I believe it's assumed to be CPT symmetric unless there's a specific operator that violates it, but I'm not certain. Wait, no. The CPT theorem says that in a Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry holds. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, 4 is a required symmetry.

So far, options must include 1 and 4. Now, what about Poincare (2)? From earlier thoughts, maybe the operators don't have to individually respect Poincare because the Lagrangian as a whole does, but each operator may not. So 2 might not be a required symmetry for each operator.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the structure of SMEFT. The SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM Lagrangian. These operators are chosen to be basis-independent and respect the SM gauge symmetry. But what about other symmetries? The SMEFT should respect all the symmetries of the SM, which includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. However, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators, not the entire theory.

Wait, perhaps each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, so they must respect Lorentz symmetry. But for Poincare, maybe the operators don't have to be individually invariant because the Lagrangian, when integrated over x, automatically respects translations.

So, the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and CPT symmetry (4), but not necessarily Poincare (2), because the Lagrangian's Poincare invariance comes from the integral, not each operator being Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but another angle: Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. If the operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, maybe each operator must be a scalar under the Poincare group. But I don't think operators are required to transform in any specific way under translations, because that's handled by the overall Lagrangian. So the operators don't have to respect Poincare symmetry individually; the theory as a whole does.

So in the SMEFT, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, and the entire Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. But the individual operators don't have to respect Poincare symmetry because their form under translations is handled by the integral in the Lagrangian.

So then, the answer would include Lorentz (1) and CPT (4), but not Poincare (2). Wait, but CPT is a combination of C, P, and T. Do the operators have to respect CPT? Or is CPT symmetry automatically enforced because the theory is Lorentz-invariant?

Yes, because if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, then it must obey CPT symmetry, according to the CPT theorem. So operators must respect CPT.

So the required symmetries are Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4, and option D is 1,3,4. So if the correct symmetries are 1 and 4, but that's not an option. Hmm, because the options don't have an option with just 1 and 4. Wait, looking back, the options:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So none of the options have just 1 and 4. Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I missed that Poincare is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So if the operators must respect Lorentz, and the entire theory respects Poincare, but the individual operators don't have to. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry, then 1 is correct. But Poincare is the combination of Lorentz and translation. So maybe each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, but not necessarily a Poincare scalar, because under translation, an operator O(x) can shift with x.

Wait, but actually, each operator is a local operator, so when you translate the theory, each operator O(x) becomes O(x+a), but the Lagrangian as a whole is invariant because the integration variable x is shifted, and you get the same integral. So the individual operator's form under translation is just a shift in x, so the operator doesn't have to be invariant under translation. Therefore, the operators don't need to respect translation symmetry individually; the Lagrangian handles it. So Poincare symmetry (2) isn't a required symmetry for each operator.

So that leaves only Lorentz (1) and CPT (4) as required symmetries for all operators. But looking back, I don't see an option that includes only 1 and 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about CPT. Maybe the operators don't have to respect CPT, but the theory as a whole must. Or perhaps each operator must respect CPT because the theory must be CPT-invariant.

Wait, if the theory is CPT-invariant, then each operator must transform in a certain way under CPT. But perhaps each operator is a scalar under CPT, or perhaps the operators can have definite CPT properties. But the question is whether all operators must respect CPT symmetry. I'm not sure. Alternatively, the theory must be CPT-invariant, but individual operators may not be.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about what each option includes.

Option C) 1,2,4: Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

If the operators must respect all three, then option C would be correct. But earlier thoughts suggested that operators only need to respect Lorentz and CPT.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if each operator must transform as a Poincare scalar, then 2 is required. But if operators don't need to be Poincare scalars, only the Lagrangian as a whole, then 2 isn't required.

Alternatively, perhaps all operators must respect Poincare. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translation, but each operator is a scalar under Lorentz, which is part of Poincare. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: in the SMEFT, operators are constructed to be renormalizable or non-renormalizable operators that respect the SM gauge symmetry. But what about other symmetries? The SM has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must too. But again, the question is whether the operators must individually respect the symmetries.

Wait, perhaps the operators are organized in such a way that they are Poincare scalars. Because the theory is Poincare-invariant, each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare. But each operator is a local scalar under Poincare because it's a function at a point, and when you translate, the operator at x becomes the same as the operator at x+a (but the integration handles it). No, that's not quite right. The operator itself doesn't have to be invariant under Poincare; it's part of a Lagrangian that is.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. What is the minimal set of symmetries that SMEFT must respect? The SM respects Poincare, so SMEFT must also respect Poincare. Therefore, all operators must be such that the sum of their terms forms a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian. That doesn't necessarily mean each operator is a Poincare scalar, but when integrated, the whole is.

But the question is about the operators, not the Lagrangian. So perhaps each operator must transform in a way that preserves the Poincare symmetry when combined in the Lagrangian.

Alternatively, perhaps each operator must be a Lorentz scalar (so 1 is correct) but not necessarily a Poincare scalar (so 2 might not be required). So maybe the correct symmetries are 1 and 4.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The options are only A)1,2; B)3,4; C)1,2,4; D)1,3,4.

Wait another thought: perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically implied by Lorentz and translation. But if the operators are local, their form under translation is O(x+a) = O(x), because when you integrate over x, it's the same. But that's only if the operator is translationally invariant. So for the Lagrangian to be translationally invariant, each operator must be translationally invariant. Because if O(x+a) ≠ O(x), then ∫O(x) d^4x would not be the same as ∫O(x+a) d^4x, but the integral of O(x+a) is the same as O(x) because of variable substitution. So perhaps each operator doesn't need to be translationally invariant because the integral takes care of it. Hence, Poincare symmetry (2) isn't a required symmetry for each operator.

So that brings us back to 1 and 4. But the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm wrong again.

Wait, perhaps all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. Because if the SMEFT Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant, each term in the Lagrangian must transform as a Poincare scalar. Which would mean each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So 2 is also required.

Wait, but I thought that the operators are local and that translation invariance is handled by the integral, not the operator itself.

Hmm. Maybe I should think in terms of the symmetries each operator must have.

Each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz (to respect Lorentz symmetry), and must be a scalar under translations (to respect Poincare). Because the Lagrangian is a sum of terms that are Poincare scalars. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar, meaning 1 and 2 are both required.

So that would mean the operators must respect both Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetries.

But wait, earlier I thought that for translation, the operator doesn't have to be a scalar because the integral handles it. So perhaps only Lorentz is required.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators are required to be Poincare scalars. So the correct symmetries would be 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. I recall that the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Additionally, because the theory is Poincare-invariant, the operators must be Poincare scalars. Wait, but Poincare includes translations, and operators are already local, so perhaps they don't have to be translationally invariant as individual entities.

Alternatively, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators are required to respect all the symmetries that the SM respects, which includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So 1,2,4 are all required.

Wait, but the question is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So if each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, then the right answer would include 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the answer.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps CP symmetry isn't required. Because the SM has CP violation, and SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. But then, operators don't have to respect CP. So 3 is not required.

So the correct symmetries would be 1,2,4. So option C.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine the correct answer, we analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it builds upon the Standard Model (SM), which respects Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must therefore be Lorentz scalars. This symmetry is required.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translations. While the SMEFT Lagrangian as a whole must respect Poincaré symmetry, the question specifically asks about the operators. Operators do not need to individually respect translation symmetry because the integral over spacetime in the Lagrangian handles translation invariance. However, operators must still respect Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is required for all operators.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM includes CP violation (e.g., through the CKM matrix). SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry, meaning CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators. Therefore, CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. This symmetry is required.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required, as operators can violate CP. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**

Answer: C
