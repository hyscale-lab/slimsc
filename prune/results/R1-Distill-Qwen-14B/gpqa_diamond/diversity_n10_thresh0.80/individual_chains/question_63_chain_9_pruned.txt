Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor is maybe a different model. Oh well, maybe the key here is that it's considering both rotational and vibrational states.

So, the molecule is X and Y. The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters, I think. The angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

The question asks about the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed so the molecule switches to the next lowest energy state. So, I think this is about energy transitions, maybe from the ground state to the first excited state.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. But when we talk about the fundamental state, I think that's the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the fundamental state is the ground state.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon, it would transition to the next higher energy state. But what's the next state with the lowest possible energy? That would probably be the first vibrational excited state (v=1) while keeping the rotational state at the lowest possible, which is J=0. Or wait, maybe it's the next state in the rotational energy level, but that depends on which change gives a lower energy transition.

Wait, in a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number. So the ground state is v=0, J=0; the next higher state could be either v=1 or J=1.

But the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition gives a lower energy increase: vibrational or rotational?

Hmm. I know that the vibrational energy spacing is usually larger than rotational spacing for diatomic molecules. So, for example
