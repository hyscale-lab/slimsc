Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles that attack the less hindered carbon of an epoxide ring, leading to inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon in disubstituted epoxides. The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups: three from the starting material and one from the reagent.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  \n   The starting material is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane system with an epoxide bridge. The substituents are at positions 1 (R), 3 (R), 4 (R), and 6 (S). The epoxide is likely between carbons 1 and 6, as these are bridgehead carbons in the bicyclic structure.\n\n2. **Reaction with Me\u2082CuLi**:  \n   - The nucleophile (methyl group from Me\u2082CuLi) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide.  \n   - In disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.  \n\n3. **Determining the Product**:  \n   - The starting material has methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4. The methyl group from the reagent adds to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, likely carbon 6 (S configuration).  \n   - Inversion at carbon 6 changes its configuration from S to R.  \n   - The epoxide ring opens, forming a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group. The substituents from the starting material and the added methyl group determine the final structure.  \n\n4. **Evaluation of Options**:  \n   - **Option A**: (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  \n     This option does not match the expected configuration, as the inversion at carbon 6 (now C2 in the product) would result in R, not S.  \n   - **Option B**: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  \n     This option suggests no inversion at the attacked carbon, which contradicts the reaction mechanism.  \n   - **Option C**: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  \n     This option does not align with the expected positions of the substituents after the epoxide opens.  \n   - **Option D**: (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol  \n     This option matches the expected configuration. The methyl group adds to C2, and the inversion at the attacked carbon results in the correct stereochemistry.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct product is (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which corresponds to **Option D**.\n\nANSWER: D"
