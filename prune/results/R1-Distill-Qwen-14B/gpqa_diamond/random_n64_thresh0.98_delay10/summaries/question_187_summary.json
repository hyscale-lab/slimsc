The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude of the star, which is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nm = M + 5 \\log_{10}(d) - 5\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( M \\) is the absolute magnitude and \\( d \\) is the distance in parsecs. A star is considered detectable if its apparent magnitude \\( m \\) is bright enough for ESPRESSO to achieve the required S/N ratio. Based on ESPRESSO's sensitivity, stars with apparent magnitudes \\( m \\leq 20 \\) are detectable.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star:\n1. **Canopus (a):** Apparent magnitude \\( m \\approx -0.7 \\) (very bright). Detectable.\n2. **Polaris (b):** Apparent magnitude \\( m \\approx 2.0 \\) (bright). Detectable.\n3. **Star c (10 pc, \\( M = 15 \\)):** \n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15\n   \\]\n   Detectable.\n4. **Star d (200 pc, \\( M = 15 \\)):** \n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(200) - 5 \\approx 21.5\n   \\]\n   Not detectable.\n5. **Star e (5 pc, \\( M = 15 \\)):** \n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(5) - 5 \\approx 13.5\n   \\]\n   Detectable.\n6. **Star f (50 pc, \\( M = 15 \\)):** \n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(50) - 5 \\approx 18.5\n   \\]\n   Detectable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe stars that are detectable are Canopus (a), Polaris (b), Star c (10 pc), Star e (5 pc), and Star f (50 pc). Star d (200 pc) is too faint to be detectable. Therefore, a total of **5 stars** meet the detectability criteria.\n\n**Answer: B**"
