For this to happen, the compound must have alpha hydrogens (hydrogens on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups).\n\n1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups in para positions (1 and 4) on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring and do not have alpha hydrogens. Additionally, moving a hydrogen would disrupt aromaticity, making tautomerism impossible. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 in a six-membered ring. Each carbonyl group is adjacent to CH\u2082 groups, which have alpha hydrogens. Therefore, this compound can undergo tautomerism.\n\nFrom this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n---\n\n### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism\nOptical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center or a combination of stereocenters that lack a plane of symmetry.\n\n1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH\u2083\u2013CH(OH)\u2013COOCH\u2083. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH\u2083, OH, COOCH\u2083, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (E)-CH\u2082(COOCH\u2083)=CH(COOCH\u2083). The molecule is symmetric, with identical groups on either side of the double bond. This symmetry prevents the formation of chiral centers, so dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nFrom this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nCombining the results from both parts:\n- **A = benzoquinone**\n- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThe correct option is **B**.\n\n**Answer: B**"
