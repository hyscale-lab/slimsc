Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, does that mean their spatial distribution is uniform? I think so. So, the number density of stars is the same everywhere. But the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Parallax, plx, is related to distance. Remember, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs.

So parallax plx is in arcseconds, right? And the bigger the distance, the smaller the parallax. So stars farther away have smaller plx.

Now, the number of stars per unit plx. Let's consider a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars are in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number depends on the volume. Wait, wait. Because parallax is inversely related to distance, a small change in plx corresponds to a larger change in distance when plx is small. So the volume of space in a shell between d and d+dd is 4πd² dd. Because the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr.

But how does this translate to parallax? Let's see. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dd would be the change in distance, which is related to dplx. Let me think, d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx decreases as d increases. So for a small change in plx (dplx), the corresponding change in distance is dd = -d² dplx. Hmm, because plx =1/d. So d=1/plx, so dd = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. So substituting, the volume element is 4π d² dd. Let's plug d =1/plx.

d squared is (1/plx)^2, and dd is -(1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/(plx²) dplx ). Wait, but the negative sign indicates direction, but since we're considering absolute volume, perhaps we can ignore the
