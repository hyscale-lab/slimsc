Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about an annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide to produce two particles each of charge + and -.

The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, no, actually, looking at it, the products are 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. So each A must have a charge of +1 and -1? Or maybe each A is a particle with charge, but combined they produce these. Hmm, not sure if the charges matter for calculating the velocity.

The given information is that the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe we can assume that the proton is at rest, or that their velocities are such that the antiproton's speed is much less than the proton's, but wait, the proton is moving? Wait, no, the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, the wording is "the antiproton is slowly moving". So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a low velocity? Or maybe both are moving, but antiproton's speed is low. Hmm, not sure. I think in particle reactions, often the initial particles are moving towards each other, but if one is moving slowly, maybe it's a non-relativistic scenario.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving at a low speed. So the initial kinetic energy might be small compared to their rest mass energies. But maybe the reaction is such that the products are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light,
