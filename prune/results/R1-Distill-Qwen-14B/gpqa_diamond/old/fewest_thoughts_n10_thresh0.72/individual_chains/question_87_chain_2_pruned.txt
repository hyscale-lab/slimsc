Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted means it has two substituents on the ring. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Hmm, wait, a benzene ring is six carbons, so substituting it with two groups makes the total more than six. Let me think: the ring has six carbons, each substituent adds some carbons. So if the total is 8, that means the substituents add two more carbons. So each substituent must add one carbon each, but wait, maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other none? Wait no, because di-substituted implies two substituents, each possibly adding a certain number of carbons.

Wait, maybe I should think about possible substituents. Oh, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents on the benzene ring are likely a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but benzene is C6H6. If it's di-substituted, two substituents replace two H's. So the total carbons would be 6 + (number from substituents). The substituents must add up to 2 carbons because the total is 8. So substituents must add 2 carbons. So the substituents must be something like one group with two carbons and another with none, but that doesn't make sense because each substituent is on the ring. Wait, no, each substituent is attached to the ring, so perhaps each substituent is a single atom or a group with one carbon.

Wait, let's think: substituents can be like -Cl, -Br, -NO2, -COOH, etc. But wait, we have a carbonyl group, so perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Let me think. So the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-R) and a halogen (like -Br, -Cl, etc.). But wait, if the substituent is -CO-R, then R would add more carbons. Let me see.

Wait, the total is 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so
