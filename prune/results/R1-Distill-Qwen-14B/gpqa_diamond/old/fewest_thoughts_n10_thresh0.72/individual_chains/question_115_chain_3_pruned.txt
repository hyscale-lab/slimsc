Alright, so I just came across this physics problem, and I'm a bit puzzled. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that electrons and positrons annihilate each other, producing gamma rays or photons. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

So, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and one is moving upper-right while the other is lower-right. I'm supposed to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. First, I need to think about the conservation laws here. Since energy and momentum must be conserved in this process, I can't ignore those. But wait, electrons and positrons are each other's antiparticles, so their annihilation must produce photons, which are massless.

Wait, but what about their momenta? The electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momenta are in opposite directions. Let me jot down what I know.

Lorentz factor, gamma, is given. For the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, gamma is 2. I remember that the Lorentz factor relates to velocity and time dilation, but more importantly here, it relates to relativistic momentum.

The relativistic momentum p is given by gamma * m * v. But wait, for each particle, their velocities are in opposite directions along the x-axis. So, I should calculate their momenta and sum them to find the total momentum before the collision. Then, after the collision, the photons' momenta must add up to the same total.

But wait, photons have momentum. Each photon's momentum is E/c, where E is its energy. And since the two photons have the same energy, their momenta will be equal in magnitude but possibly in different directions.

Let me think about the momenta. Let's denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p.

Since the electron is moving from the left (let's say positive x direction) and the positron from the right (so negative x direction), their momenta are in opposite directions. So, p_e is positive, and p_p is negative. The total momentum
