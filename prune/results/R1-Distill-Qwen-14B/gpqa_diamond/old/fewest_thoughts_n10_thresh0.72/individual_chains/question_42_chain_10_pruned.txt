Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not super sure about that, but maybe it's not directly relevant here.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 and Planet2 have a ratio of about 1.4. So, that means Planet2's equilibrium temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet1. Similarly, Planet2 and Planet3 have a ratio of 2.3, so Planet3 is 2.3 times as hot as Planet2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ratio is given as Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3. Wait, no, actually, the way it's phrased: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." Hmm. Oh, wait, I think the ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4? Or T2/T1? Because the wording says "between" Planet1 and Planet2, but the order matters. The same with Planet2 and Planet3. Oh, wait, the question says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So I think it's T1/T2 = 1.4. Or is it T2/T1? Hmm. Hmm, maybe the ratio could be either. I need to clarify this.

Wait, the problem says the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. Let's assume that it's T1 over T2 equals 1.4, meaning Planet1 is hotter than Planet2. But wait, no, not necessarily. Because actually, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. If the star is the same for all, then T is proportional to (Lstar/(16πσd²))^(1/4), so T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then (d2/d1)^(1/2) = 1.4. So d2 is d1*(
