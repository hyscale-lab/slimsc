Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given from A to D.

First, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes, but the number of moles remains the same, right? So, the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated before dilution.

Wait, the initial volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. The concentration is 0.05 M. So moles are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Then, we dilute it by adding 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L.

So the new concentration after dilution is moles/volume. That's 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, we can find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001, as calculated before. Since NaOH reacts 1:1 with acetic acid (the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O), the moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed at equivalence point is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So when we add 25% of this volume, that would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's tackle each part separately.

First, the pH at 25% titration. At this point, only 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So let's calculate how much has reacted.

Moles of NaOH added at 25%: 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.00025 moles.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Initially, before any NaOH is added:
CH3COOH: 0.001 moles
NaOH: 0
CH3COO^-: 0

After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH:
CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles
CH3COO^-: 0.00025 moles

But wait, the total volume at this point is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added. So, 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ (since 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³) = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by the formula pKa = -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa ≈ 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, which I can approximate as 4.74).

So plugging into the equation: pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.263. So about 4.26.

Now, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, so we have the conjugate base (acetate ions) in solution. But acetate is a weak base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The moles of acetate ions at equivalence are 0.001 moles (same as the initial moles of acetic acid). The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, which is 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. Since Kb is small, we can approximate the [OH^-] using the formula:

OH^- concentration ≈ sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH near 9 at equivalence. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check. The equivalence point for a weak acid with a strong base is when we have the
