Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. Their 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different pairs of compounds, and I need to figure out which pair matches the NMR data.

First, I should probably figure out what each compound looks like. All the given options are tetramethylbenzenes except for option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, wait, no, option C has 1,4-diethylbenzene and another. Let me see the options:

Options:
A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Wait, so all the options except option C are pairs of tetramethylbenzenes. Option C includes a diethylbenzene, which is different. So I need to consider all possibilities.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Let's check the molecular formula for each option. For the tetramethylbenzenes:

Methyl groups are CH3. So benzene (C6H6) with four CH3 groups would be C6H6 + 4CH3 = C10H14. Oh wait, because each CH3 has 3 H, so four CH3 would add 12 H. Benzene has 6 H, so total would be 6 + 12 = 18 H? Wait, that can't be right because the molecular formula is C10H14.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. Benzene is C6H6. Each CH3 adds a carbon and three hydrogens. So four CH3 groups add 4 carbons (so total C6+4=10) and 4*3=12 hydrogens. So benzene has 6 H, so total would be 6+12=18 H. But the given formula is C10H14, which has 14 H. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait no, wait. Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have four methyl groups attached to the benzene. Each methyl is CH3, so four CH3 would contribute 4*(1 C +3 H) =4 C and 12 H. Benzene has 6 C and 6 H. So total is 6C +4C =10C, and 6H +12H=18 H. But the molecular formula in the question is C10H14. That's a problem because 18 H is 4 more than 14. So something must be different.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong structures. Let me think: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have four CH3 groups attached at positions 1,2,4,5. So same as the previous, four methyl groups. So same issue. Similarly, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is also four methyl groups, leading to 10 C and 18 H. But the molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps
