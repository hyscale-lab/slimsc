Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe I misread. Oh right, benzene rings are numbered, so 1-bromo-2-d... Wait, wait, the subscript 'd' probably refers to deuterium. Oh, right, sometimes in these problems, you have isotopes like deuterium involved. Oh wait, perhaps the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are substituted.

And the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution. Oh wait, this is probably a Friedel-Crafts deprotonation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts usually involves alkylation or acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction? No, wait, Birch uses metals like Na or Li and NH3 under pressure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: perhaps this is a hydrogen/deuterium exchange or elimination. Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for alkenes.

Wait another thought: 1-bromo-2-d benzene... I think I've heard about reactions involving the deuterium isotope in aromatic rings. Maybe it's about the dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. In the context of aromatic rings, if the ring is activated towards deprotonation, perhaps it's undergoing a deprotonation to form a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then do something else.

Wait, but wait, in the case of benzene with substituents, certain positions are more acidic. For example, para positions to electron-withdrawing groups are more acidic because the ring can stabilize the negative charge.

In this case, the substituents are Br and D (deuterium). Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group because of its electronegativity. So the ring is activated towards deprotonation at positions where the negative charge can be stabilized.

So where on the benzene ring would the base (like NaNH2) abstract a proton?

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So positions 1 (Br) and 2 (D) are substituted. Let me draw the structure in my mind. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho substitution). So the substituents are in the ortho positions.

So, the ring has a Br at position 1 and a D at position 2. Let's number the ring: position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, position 3 is H, position 4 is H, position 5 is H, position 6 is H.

Wait, but deuterium is H's isotope. So when considering acidity, the D is less acidic than H because it's harder to remove the proton (or deuteron) when it's already deuterium.

So the base NaNH2 is a strong base and would abstract a proton from the ring. But which proton?

The positions ortho and para to the Br would be more acidic because Br is electron-withdrawing. So in the benzene ring, the positions that are ortho and para to Br are positions 2,4,6 (since Br is at 1). Wait, wait: position 1 is Br, so ortho positions would be 2 and 6. Para would be position 4.

But wait, position 2 is already D, so the available positions for deprotonation would be 4 and 6.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The substituents are Br at 1 and D at 2. So the ring has Br in position 1, D in position 2, and the other positions (3,4,5,6) have H.

The electrons in the ring are directed. The Br is an electron-withdrawing group, so it deactivates the ring. But in this case, since Br is at position 1, the ring's positions 2 and 6 (ortho) and position 4 (para) are the most acidic, because those positions are in conjugation with the EWG (Br). So these positions are more likely to lose a proton.

But position 2 already has a D, so the base can't deprotonate there. So the possible positions for deprotonation are 4 and 6.

Wait, is position 6 adjacent to the D? Let me see: position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, so position 6 is next to position 1 (Br) and position 5, which is H. So position 6 is ortho to Br. So it's a likely site for deprotonation.

Similarly, position 4 is para to Br. So that's another possible site.

So when NaNH2 is added, it abstracts a proton from either position 4 or 6, leading to a phenide ion. But wait, isn't that the case for meta directors? Wait, no, I think when a ring has strong EWG like NO2, the meta positions are more activated. Wait, but Br is a deactivating group, so deprotonation occurs in the positions ortho and para to Br, as those are the positions where the ring is most activated (i.e., least deactivated) for deprotonation.

Wait, but in this case, the ring is already deprotonated, so perhaps it's forming a benzene ring with a negative charge. Wait, but how does that stabilize? The deprotonation would occur where the ring can best stabilize the negative charge, which would be in positions ortho and para to the EWG (Br).

So the possible positions for deprotonation are 4 and 6.

Wait, but wait, the initial compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So positions 1 and 2 are substituted. So positions 4 and 6 are each two positions away from Br (para and ortho, respectively), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for alkenes. Or maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution? But in that case, the ring would need to be activated. But Br is an EWG, which would deactivate the ring, making nucleophilic substitution less likely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps this is a hydrogen/deuterium exchange. NaNH2 is a strong base, but if the solvent is condensed ammonia, maybe it's also acting as a source of NH2- which could abstract a proton.

Wait, but the substituents are Br and D, so the possible sites for deprotonation are positions 4 and 6. So when the base abstracts a proton from either position 4 or 6, we get two possible products.

Wait, but wait: when the base abstracts the proton, the ring becomes negatively charged. But since the ring is aromatic, perhaps the negative charge can delocalize, leading to possible resonance structures. But in this case, since the substituents are Br and D, the negative charge would be in the ortho and para positions.

Wait, but after deprotonation, what happens? If the reaction is stopped after deprotonation, then the product is a phenide ion. But the question is about the organic products, so perhaps the product is the corresponding benzene ring with a deuterium and a bromine, and a missing proton (so a D-, Br- ring? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't deprotonation. Another possibility: if the compound undergoes a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure under what conditions that would happen.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, NaNH2 in ammonia is a common condition for eliminating HX from a benzyl halide, but in this case, the compound is an aryl halide, not an alkyl halide.

Wait, but wait, perhaps this is a case of elimination to form a triple bond. But in an aromatic ring, elimination would lead to something like a benzyn intermediate, but that's more in the case of adjacent dihalides.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is abstracting a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to a benzene ring with Br and a negative charge, which could lead to a coupling reaction. But I'm not sure under what conditions that would happen.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is meta director deprotonation, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and the base abstracts a proton from position 4, then the product would have deuterium at 2 and bromine at 1, and a negative charge at 4. But that's a phenide ion. Similarly, abstracting from position 6 would give a negative charge there.

Wait, but in terms of possible products, after deprotonation, would the phenide ion undergo any further reactions? Or is the stopping point the phenide ion, which would then be a product.

Wait, but in such reactions, the phenide might form a dimer if there's coupling, but the question is about how many organic products there are. If only one product is formed, perhaps it's a single product, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, which deprotonates the ring. The possible sites for deprotonation are positions 4 and 6 (since they're ortho and para to Br, which is an EWG). So that would give two products: the phenide ions at positions 4 and 6.

But then, when you protonate (or deuterate?), would the products be different?

Wait, but in the reaction conditions, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a source of NH3. Upon workup, perhaps the phenide ion would pick up a proton (or deuterium) from the solvent.

Wait, but in the presence of D2O, the deuterium would come from there, but if the solvent is NH3, which is not a heavy water solvent, perhaps the proton comes from NH3, but I'm not sure about the exact workup.

Alternatively, maybe the deprotonation is followed by elimination, forming a triple bond between adjacent carbons, but that's more when you have two halides adjacent. Here, we have Br and D in adjacent positions (positions 1 and 2), but elimination would require two adjacent halides, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another thought: could the reaction be a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzyn intermediate? But I'm not sure, because that usually requires two leaving groups adjacent to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation leads to an aryne formation if there's a possibility of forming a triple bond.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are Br and D, which are not leaving groups. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is removing a proton in a position that allows for the formation of a new bond. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is simply the deprotonated phenide ion, which would result in a mono-substituted structure. But since the deprotonation can happen in two different positions (4 and 6), that would lead to two different products.

Wait, but are positions 4 and 6 equivalent in this molecule? Let's look at the structure again. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. The molecule is symmetric along the axis passing through position 1 and position 4. So, position 4 is across from position 1, and position 6 is next to position 1 on the opposite side.

Wait, wait, perhaps positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. Let me think about the structure. Let me imagine the benzene ring with Br at position 1, D at position 2. The positions 4 and 6 are ortho to Br, but in different locations relative to the D at position 2.

So, abstracting a proton from position 4 would give a phenide ion where the negative charge is at position 4, which is across from Br.

Abstracting a proton from position 6 would give a negative charge at position 6, which is ortho to Br and adjacent to position 5.

Wait, but are these two positions in equivalent environments?

Hmm, perhaps not. Because the D is at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br) and position 3.

So, position 4 is para to Br, and not near D. Position 6 is ortho to Br, but on the opposite side from D.

Wait, so when the base abstracts a proton from position 4, the phenide ion would have the negative charge at position 4. When it abstracts from position 6, the negative charge would be at position 6.

But are these two positions equivalent in the molecule? Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry perhaps through position 1 and position 4. Wait, let me number the ring:

1: Br

2: D

3: H

4: H

5: H

6: H

So, position 4 is opposite to Br (position 1). Position 6 is next to Br on the other side from D.

Wait, so the structure is such that positions 4 and 6 are not mirror images. Because position 6 is adjacent to position 1 and 5, whereas position 4 is opposite.

So, if the deprotonation occurs at position 4 and 6, they would be two distinct products, because the resulting negative charges are in different positions relative to the substituents.

So that would give two possible products.

But wait, the question says "how many possible organic products are there in this reaction?" So after deprotonation, perhaps the phenide ion could undergo some reaction, but if the reaction stops after deprotonation, then the products are the two phenide ions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction goes further. For example, if the phenide ion undergoes a coupling reaction, like a Kolbe-Schmitt reaction or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: the phenide ion could undergo an elimination reaction, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the phenide ion could quench with something else, but in the given reaction conditions, it's just NaNH2 in ammonia.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but as I thought earlier, that's more for alkenes.

Another angle: perhaps this is a case of nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which is not the case here because Br is an EWG, making the ring less reactive towards nucleophiles. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by a NH2 group, but in such conditions, I don't think that's likely. NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile in that context.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br leaves, but that would require a good leaving group, which Br is, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps elimination occurs. But I'm not sure what product would form in that case.

Wait, but if the Br leaves, then we have a benzene ring with a D at position 2 and a negative charge at position 4 or 6.

Wait, but elimination would require another leaving group, which we don't have here. So perhaps that's not the case.

So, perhaps the only products are the two phenide ions formed by deprotonation at positions 4 and 6.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the solvent is NH3, which is a weak acid compared to water. So when the phenide ion is formed, it might not protonate, but perhaps the reaction stops at that stage. So the products would be the deprotonated rings, but in that case, would they be considered different products?

Wait, but in reality, the phenide ion would be in equilibrium with the protonated form. But since the solvent is ammonia, which is a weaker acid than water, perhaps the phenide ion would be the major species. So the products would be the two phenide ions.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible number of products.

If deprotonation can occur at two distinct positions (4 and 6), leading to two different phenide ions, then the number of products would be two.

But wait, am I missing any other possible sites for deprotonation? Let's see: the ring has Br at 1, D at 2, and other positions are H. So positions 3,4,5,6 have H. The EWG (Br) is at 1, so the meta positions to Br are positions 3 and 5. Are those positions acidic?

Wait, usually, the para and ortho positions to EWG are more acidic. So positions ortho (2 and 6) and para (4) to Br would be more acidic than meta (3 and 5). So the base would abstract from 4 and 6, but position 2 is already D, so only 4 and 6 are available.

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to Br (position 1) and position 5. So the acidity would be highest at position 4 (para to Br) and position 6 (ortho to Br). So two sites.

Thus, two possible products.

Wait, but the answer options don't have two as the correct one. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4

B) 1

C) 2

D)3

So, if the answer is C) 2, that's option C.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, and upon deprotonation at positions 4 and 6, the product is the same because of symmetry. Could that be the case?

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes positions 4 and 6 equivalent, then deprotonation at either would give the same product.

Wait, let's imagine the structure again. Br is at 1, D at 2.

So, the ring looks like:

Positions:

1: Br

2: D

3: H

4: H (para to Br)

5: H

6: H (ortho to Br and adjacent to 1)

So, is there a symmetry element that makes positions 4 and 6 equivalent?

I think not. Because position 4 is across from Br and position 6 is next to Br, and each is adjacent to different substituents.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a mirror plane that goes through the Br (position 1) and the position opposite to it (position 4). So, position 2 and position 6 would be mirror images.

Wait, but position 2 has D, and position 6 is H. So that would not make them mirror images in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps after deprotonation at position 6, the structure would be symmetric in a way that position 4 and 6 are equivalent. No, because the substituents are different.

Wait, maybe the answer is only one product because the two positions are equivalent. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that positions 4 and 6 are distinct. Maybe the molecule has some symmetry that I'm not seeing.

Another approach: draw the structure on paper to visualize.

But since I can't do that, I'll try to imagine it.

If the ring is Br at position 1, D at 2, then the positions 4 and 6 are in different environments. Position 4 is para to Br, while position 6 is ortho to Br and meta to D.

Therefore, the two phenide ions formed by deprotonation at 4 and 6 would be non-equivalent, leading to two distinct products.

So, the number of possible organic products would be 2, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thought: could the reaction lead to more than one product if there's some rearrangement or if the base abstracts a proton, and then another proton elsewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps the ring undergoes some isomerization, but I don't think so under these conditions.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is two possible products, so option C.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base that abstracts protons from the benzene ring, particularly at positions where the negative charge can be stabilized. Bromine (Br) at position 1 is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), making the ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4) positions more acidic. However, position 2 is already occupied by deuterium (D), leaving positions 4 and 6 as the available sites for deprotonation.

Deprotonation at position 4 (para to Br) and position 6 (ortho to Br) leads to two distinct phenide ions. These two positions are not equivalent because the environments around them differ due to the substituents on the ring. Position 4 is directly opposite Br, while position 6 is adjacent to Br and next to position 5 (which is unsubstituted). Therefore, the phenide ions formed at positions 4 and 6 are structurally distinct.

Since the reaction stops at the phenide ion stage (no further reactions are indicated), there are two possible organic products corresponding to the phenide ions at positions 4 and 6. Thus, the number of possible organic products is **2**.

Answer: C
