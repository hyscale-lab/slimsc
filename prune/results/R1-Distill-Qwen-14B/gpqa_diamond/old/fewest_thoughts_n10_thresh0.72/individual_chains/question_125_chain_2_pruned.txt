Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me try to understand what the question is asking.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this is Hooke's law kind of potential, so the force would be like F = -mω² r, which is a restoring force, similar to a spring. 

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. So, I need to find both the energy and the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy) for the third excited state.

First, I'll think about the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, for the isotropic case, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z, but since it's isotropic, maybe it's better to think in terms of the radial quantum number as well.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the general formula for the energy levels in a 3D harmonic oscillator. I think each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for that direction, so x, y, z. So the total energy would be the sum for each direction.

So the total energy E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, since each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, summing over all three gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but another way to think is that for each mode (x, y, z), the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω. So the total energy is sum(n_i) + 3/2 multiplied by ħω.

In three dimensions, the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So the sum n_x + n_y + n_z is a non-negative integer, let's call it N. So each state with the same N will have the same energy.

Wait, but I think the energy levels are grouped by N, where N is the sum of the quantum numbers. So each energy level is E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what the ground state and excited states are here. Let's think: the ground state is the lowest energy state. So for N=0 (since n_x = n_y = n_z = 0), E = (0 + 3/2) ħω.

The first excited state would be the next possible energy level. That would correspond to N=1. So E = (1 +3/2) ħω = 5/2 ħω.

The second excited state would be N=2,
