Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question has two reactions, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Then, based on the options, choose the correct combination.

Starting with reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. H+ might be a proton source, like in an acid workup.

So, the starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atomâ€”in this case, the spiro is between a cyclopentane (3-membered?) and a larger ring. Wait, 3.5 means one ring is 3 carbons and the other is 5, right? So it's a bridge structure.

The molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, at position 1, there's a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the spiro atom, which is an alcohol. The structure probably looks like a bicyclic system where the spiro atom is connected to the vinyl and an oxygen from the alcohol.

When a strong base like KH is used, especially in THF, it's likely deprotonating something. But wait, the compound has an alcohol group. Alcohols can be deprotonated to form alkoxide ions, which are good leaving groups. So, maybe an E2 elimination is happening here.

Wait, but in the presence of a base, elimination reactions occur. So the alcohol (OH) is a good leaving group once deprotonated. But wait, for E2, a base abstracts a proton that's anti-periplanar to the leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond.

In this case, the starting molecule already has a double bond. Hmm, but wait, the spiro compound: the 5-en suggests a double bond in the spiro system. Let me imagine the structure. The spiro would be between a 3-membered and 5-membered ring, connected at carbon 1, which has the vinyl group and the hydroxyl group.

Wait, so if the OH is on carbon 1, and the double bond is at position 5, the structure must be such that when the OH is deprotonated, it can leave as water, and the base abstracts a proton somewhere else to form a new double bond, perhaps leading to a more stable structure.

Alternatively, the reaction could be an acid-catalyzed dehydration, but I don't think so because the reagents are a strong base. So it's likely an E2 elimination.

Wait, another thought: I've heard about Cope and Claisen rearrangements, but I'm not sure if this fits. The starting material is a spiro alcohol, and the reaction conditions involve a strong base and then H+ workup. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-type rearrangement, but that's typically for vicinal diols.

Wait, maybe it's an example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or
