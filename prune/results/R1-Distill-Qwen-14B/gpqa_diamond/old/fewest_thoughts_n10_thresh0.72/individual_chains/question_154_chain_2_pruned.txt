Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the unknown compound is based on the spectral data provided. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

Let me start by looking at the molecular ion peak. The molecular ion is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158 with 32% intensity. I remember that molecular ion peaks can help determine the molecular formula. The molecular weight is 156. So, what's the possible formula?

Wait, 156. Let me think about possible combinations. Maybe C9H7ClO2? Because 12*9=108, 1*7=7, 35.5 (Cl)â‰ˆ35.5, 16*2=32. Adding them up: 108+7=115 +35.5=150.5 +32=182.5? Hmm, that's way over 156. Maybe I got that wrong.

Alternatively, let me see: 156. Could it be something like C8H8O2? Let's calculate: 8*12=96, 8*1=8, 16*2=32. 96+8=104 +32=136. Hmm, not enough. Maybe C9H10O2? 9*12=108, 10=10, 32. Total 148. Still under 156.

Wait, I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. Another approach: the molecular ion is at 156, and there's a peak at 158, which is 2 units higher. That suggests maybe a chlorine is present, because Cl has an atomic mass of about 35.5, but wait, 158 is 156 +2. Oh wait, wait! Chlorine's isotope is about 35Cl and 37Cl. So the molecular ion would be at 156 (assuming Cl is 35Cl, so 35), but the 158 would be the same molecule with a 37Cl isotope. Because the natural abundance of Cl-35 is about 75% and Cl-37 is about 25%. So the molecular ion at 156 and 158 with approximately 3:1 ratio, which would fit if the molecular formula has one Cl atom. Because the ratio would be roughly 3:1, since 75% (Cl-35) would give m/z 156, and 25% (Cl-37) gives m/z 158. So that explains the two peaks.

So the molecular formula probably includes one Cl. So, the formula could be C8H5ClO2? Let's check: 8*12=96, 5=5, 35.5 (Cl)=35.5, 16*2=32. Adding them: 96+5=101 +35.5=136.5 +32=168.5. That's higher than 156, so that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think of another approach. Let me think about the IR data. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, it's broad and from 3500-2700. Oh, wait, 2700 is lower than the typical O-H stretch. Oh, wait, maybe it's an aliphatic or aromatic O-H? Or could it be an alcohol or carboxylic acid?

Wait, the strong sharp peak at 1720
