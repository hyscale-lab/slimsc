Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the potential energy of this system where a charge q is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially when grounded, there are some specific things to consider about induced charges and potentials.

Wait, the sphere is grounded, right? So any induced charges will be neutralized by the Earth. That probably means the sphere itself won't have any net charge, but there might be induced charges on its surface due to the charge q nearby.

Wait, no. Wait, if the sphere is conducting and grounded, when you bring a charge near it, the charges in the conductor will redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would flow away, but in this case, the charge q is outside the sphere. So maybe the sphere's induced charges are such that the exterior is shielded, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: I think when a charge is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's surface develops induced charges. The conductor's interior has no electric field. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as the ground's potential, which is zero.

So, the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. The potential of the charge q in the electric field due to the sphere must be considered. But wait, the potential energy of the system would be the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about
