Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics and the impulse approximation. Hmm, I need to figure out which assumptions lead to that approximation. Let's think through each part step by step.

The question says that the impulse approximation assumes nucleons behave like free particles. So, in this scenario, the nucleus is treated as if each nucleon is acting independently, without much interaction with the others beyond what's needed for the calculation.

The four assumptions are numbered 1 to 4. The options are combinations of these. I need to pick the correct trio.

First, let's understand each point:

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So this means the force or interaction acts on each nucleon separately, not considering their collective behavior. Like, each nucleon feels the interaction alone, not as part of a group.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, transparent? Oh right, in some models, the nucleus is considered as a collection of individual targets. So, when a particle interacts, it's only with one nucleon, and the rest are just along for the ride, not affecting the interaction. So the nucleus doesn't change much except for that one nucleon. Like, the other nucleons don't influence the interaction because they're just spectators.

3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, non-relativistic quarks. Well, if quarks are non-relativistic, that probably means their velocities are low, so their kinetic energies are much less than their rest mass energy. But wait, isn't that a bit odd because quarks are always confined and move at relativistic speeds in nucleons? Oh wait, maybe in some approximations, like the impulse approximation, you treat the nucleon as if its internal structure (quarks) doesn't change much. So perhaps the non-relativistic assumption here is about the motion of the nucleon as a whole, not the quarks. Or maybe it's about the interaction being treated in a way that the quarks don't move much during the interaction. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps this assumption is suggesting that the internal dynamics (like quarks moving inside the nucleon) are treated non-relativistically, which might mean that the nucleon behaves more like a point particle, thus allowing for the impulse approximation.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, so this one is saying that while the interaction is happening, the nucleon isn't experiencing any of the strong nuclear forces that hold it in the nucleus. So it's treated as if it's free, not bound. Hence, it can move or change without any force from the nucleus holding it in place.

Now, the impulse approximation is a model where the interactions are treated as if each nucleon is a free particle. So when a reaction occurs, it's like the incoming particle interacts with a single nucleon, and the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect that interaction. 

So let's see which assumptions contribute to this. 

Assumption 1: The current interacts with individual nucleons. So, each nucleon is treated separately. That supports the impulse approximation because it's about individual interactions.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. So, the rest of the nucleus doesn't do anything but let the interaction pass through, so the interaction is only with one nucleon. That makes sense because in the impulse approximation, it's like the nucleus is a collection of independent targets.

Assumption 3: Quarks are non-relativistic. Wait, that's tricky. If quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps their internal motion isn't significant, meaning the nucleon's structure doesn't change much. So the nucleon behaves like a point particle, hence like a free nucleon. So this would support the approximation because the nucleon's internal structure isn't complicating the interaction.

Assumption 4: No binding forces. So the selected nucleon is not held by the strong force
