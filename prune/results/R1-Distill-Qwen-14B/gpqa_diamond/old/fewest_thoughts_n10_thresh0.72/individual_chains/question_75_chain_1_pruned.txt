Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. The setup is a bit detailed, so I'll break it down.

The researcher created a transgenic mouse model to overexpress GADD45G. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressing as expected.

The plus strand sequence given is the coding sequence. I need to look for possible issues in this sequence that would prevent proper protein expression.

Let me think about the possible options:

Option A: The HA tag has a missense mutation. That could affect the protein's structure or recognition. But if the HA tag is not functional, perhaps the purification wouldn't work, but the question is about overexpression. But if the mutation is in the coding sequence, maybe the tag isn't present, but the rest of the protein might still be expressed. Maybe not the main issue here.

Option B: Ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If there's a stop codon in the sequence, the ribosome would stop translating early, leading to a truncated protein. Looking at the sequence, I need to check for in-frame stop codons.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. A linker might be needed to prevent the protein from being degraded. If the HA tag is directly fused without a linker, maybe the host's proteases are cleaving it. But if the protein isn't expressed at all, proteolysis might not explain it unless the construct isn't made. But the problem here is overexpression isn't happening, so maybe the protein isn't even being made.

Option D: Mouse lacks tRNA for UAA codon. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But in the coding sequence, any UAA would cause a stop. But in the construct's coding sequence, I need to check if there's a UAA in frame. If there's a UAA, the ribosome would stop early.

Alternatively, wait, if the plasmid is in CHO cells, which are mammalian, so the tRNA issue would be in the cells used. But the question says that when they transfected the plasmid into CHO cells, they couldn't express the protein. So perhaps the problem is in the construct's sequence, like a premature stop codon.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence. Let me find any in-frame stop codons. Remember, the sequence is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. So the mRNA would have the sequence read 5' to 3' as the complementary of the DNA's plus strand.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the DNA is the plus strand (coding), so the mRNA is synthesized as complementary to the DNA's template strand. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus DNA strand but with T replaced by U. So the mRNA sequence is the same as the plus DNA, but with U's.

So I can look through the DNA sequence for any occurrence of the triplet TAG, TGA, or TAA. Because these are the stop codons in mRNA (they would correspond to ATG in DNA for start, and TAG, TGA, TAA as stops in DNA would be stops in mRNA as well? Wait, no. Wait, DNA is double-stranded. The coding strand is the same as mRNA, except Tâ†’U. So, in the DNA coding strand, a stop codon would be TGA, TAG, or TAA. Because mRNA is made from the template strand, which is complementary. So the mRNA would have the same sequence as the coding DNA, but with U instead of T. So any TGA in DNA corresponds to UGA in mRNA
