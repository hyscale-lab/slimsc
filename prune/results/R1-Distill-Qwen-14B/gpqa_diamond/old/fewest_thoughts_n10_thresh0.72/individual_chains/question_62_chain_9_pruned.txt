Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break down the structure.

So, the target has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to one of the carbons is a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH. Also attached is another cyclohexyl group, making it cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Wait, no, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Oh, right, the aldehyde group is on the same carbon as the cyclohexyl and hydroxy methyl? Or wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let me visualize this.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent on carbon 1. That substituent is a hydroxyethyl group attached to another cyclohexane? Or maybe it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2CHO group. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (CHO) attached. Then, on the same carbon where the CHO is (position 1), there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that substituent is a CH2- group, where one H is replaced by hydroxy (OH) and the other is connected to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe it's:

The main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, where the carbonyl is at position 1. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a CHO group at position 1, and another substituent at position 1: CH2(cyclohexyl)(OH). So, the substituent is
