Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it. So, the problem says we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3, nowhere else. I need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Wait, I remember that the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. Oh right, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex number with real and imaginary parts. So to find the probability, I need to compute the modulus squared of this wave function.

The modulus squared of a complex number z = A + Bi is |z|^2 = A² + B². So in this case, the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Wait, no, wait. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So
