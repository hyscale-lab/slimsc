Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We're supposed to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed, and then find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so it's a base. When you add a strong acid to it, they should neutralize each other. The acid will donate H+ ions, and the base will donate OH- ions. The reaction should produce water and the corresponding salt.

First, I need to write down the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Since the acid is monobasic, like HCl, HNO3, etc., the reaction would be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

Wait, no, more accurately, the acid would donate H+ ions. So Fe(OH)3 is a base that can accept H+ ions. So the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

Yes, that makes sense because each OH- in Fe(OH)3 will react with an H+ to form water.

Next, I should calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Let me compute that.

Fe has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH group is 17 g/mol (16 for O and 1 for H). So three OH groups would be 3*17=51 g/mol. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass.

Moles = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me calculate that more accurately:

0.1 divided by 106.85. Let me do the division:

106.85 × 0.000936 ≈ 0.1, so yeah, about 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ (from the strong acid). So the mole ratio is 1:3.

So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

Wait, but the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume of acid needed can be found from M = moles / volume.

Molarity (M) = moles / liters. So rearranged, volume (L) = moles / M.

Moles needed are 0.002808. Molarity is 0.1 M.

Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. Because 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 0.02808 L is 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. Hmm, possibly because of more precise calculations in the actual problem.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, but I'm assuming all the solution is made up to 100 cm³ after adding the acid. Or is the acid volume part of the total?

Wait, the problem says "dissolve in 100 cm³ total volume". So the volume of the resulting solution is 100 cm³. The acid's volume is part of that, but the 100 cm³ includes everything. So my calculation is correct because the moles required are based on the acid's concentration and the volume needed.

Wait, no, wait. The way the problem is phrased: "What is the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution". So perhaps the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3, and the total volume is 100 cm³. So the acid's volume plus the solution's volume (from Fe(OH)3 dissolution) should be 100 cm³. But wait, Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so when you dissolve it, the volume of the solution might not change much. So I think the 100 cm³ is the total solution after adding the acid. So the acid's volume is subtracted from 100 cm³? Or added? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, let me think. The process is: you have solid Fe(OH)3. You add some strong acid (volume V). The acid reacts with Fe(OH)3, dissolving it. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³. So the acid's volume plus any dilution from dissolution would make up 100 cm³. But in reality, the volume of the solid isn't adding to the solution, so the volume of the acid is V, and the total volume after adding
