Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. They also mention to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So it's just a straightforward relativity problem, I think.

Hmm, inertial framesâ€¦ so we're dealing with classical mechanics, not relativity? Wait, but wait, the speeds involved are 60,000 km/s. Let me think. That's way faster than the speed of light. Oh wait, no, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s, which is 6e7 m/s. Wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so 6e7 is about 0.2 times the speed of light. So it's a significant fraction, but maybe the problem is intended to be solved using classical mechanics, not special relativity. Or maybe they want us to use the Lorentz transformation. Hmm, but I'm not sure because the question mentions frames of reference moving relative to each other.

Wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center at 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame, right? Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it, and in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy moves towards the ejecta.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center (so let's say direction is positive towards galaxy's center). So in galaxy's frame, ejecta's velocity is v = 60,000 km/s towards the center. Then, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at the same speed, right? Because velocities reverse direction when you switch
