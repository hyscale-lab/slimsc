Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and which symmetries its operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that encapsulates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators, right? The question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries.

Wait, first, I should clarify what each of these symmetries mean. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames, which includes rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it's like the bigger symmetry group that includes both. Then there's CP, which stands for Charge conjugation and Parity symmetry. CPT is Charge-Parity-Time reversal symmetry, which I think is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory.

In the Standard Model, which is the underlying theory for SMEFT, which symmetries are respected? I recall that the SM has Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily CP symmetry. Like, in the electroweak theory, CP is broken, but that's more about the symmetry. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory, so it should respect the same symmetries as the SM unless modified by the higher-dimension operators.

Wait, but the question is about the operators in SMEFT. I think that when you write down operators in SMEFT, you have to ensure that you don't break any symmetries that are present in the SM. So, for example,
