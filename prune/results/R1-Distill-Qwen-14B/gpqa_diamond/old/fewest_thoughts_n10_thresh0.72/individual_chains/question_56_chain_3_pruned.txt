Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options are about the possible routes and their probabilities.

Wait, let me think. Dipole transitions are electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen are something like Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n=1, l=0, m=0. So from l=0 to l=0? That can't be right because l usually changes by ±1. Oh wait, but wait, the transition is via two steps. So each step must follow the selection rules, but the total change from 3 to 1 is two steps, each involving a change in l.

So the first transition is from n=3, l=0 to some intermediate state, then to n=1, l=0. Wait, but the first transition's destination must have l=1 (since l can change by ±1). Because starting from l=0, you can only go to l=1 in the first step.

So the first step would be |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l=1, m'⟩. And then from there, the next step would have to go to |1,0,0⟩. So the intermediate state must have l=1 and in the second transition, l goes from 1 to 0, which is allowed since Δl=−1.

Now, let's think about the possible m transitions. From m=0, the first transition can go to m=0, +1, or -1, since Δm can be 0, ±1. But wait, the initial state has m=0, so first transition m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So the intermediate state could have m=0, +1, or -1.

But for
