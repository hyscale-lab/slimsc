Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, totaling 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases is formed, which is passed through some tubes. The results are given for three tubes, and we end up with 2.24 liters of gas C at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

First, I'll try to visualize the setup. The mixture of salts is heated in an inert atmosphere (no air), so probably decomposition occurs. The gases produced go through three tubes:

1. Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can trap water vapor. So, any water in the gas would be absorbed here, increasing the tube's weight.

2. Tube №2: Ca(OH)2 solution. This is probably to absorb CO2 because Ca(OH)2 reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. So, if CO2 is present, the solution's weight would increase. But the problem states that the weight of tube №2 didn't change, which suggests no CO2 was present in the gas mixture.

3. Tube №3: Red-hot copper. I think this setup is for the oxidation of certain gases. For example, if there's H2 gas, it would react with Cu at high temperatures. The reaction would produce CuO, increasing the tube's weight. The problem says the weight increased by 0.80 g, so some H2 must have been present and reacted with the copper.

After these tubes, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at STP. STP conditions are 0°C and 1 atm, where 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So, 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. That probably means gas C is a diatomic gas because 0.1 moles would mean either 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles if it's a diatomic molecule. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 22.4 L is 1 mole. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So, if gas C is something like O2 or N2, which are diatomic, 0.1 moles would mean 0.05 moles of O2? Wait, no, each molecule is diatomic, so moles in terms of molecules is double. Wait, no, for gas calculations, we count moles of gas, regardless of whether they're diatomic. So, 0.1 moles of O2, for example.

Wait, maybe I should think about each step's implications.

So, the gases produced from the salts A and B are passed through the tubes.

Tube 1: Gained 3.60 g. Since Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water, this must be the mass of water absorbed. So, the gas mixture probably
