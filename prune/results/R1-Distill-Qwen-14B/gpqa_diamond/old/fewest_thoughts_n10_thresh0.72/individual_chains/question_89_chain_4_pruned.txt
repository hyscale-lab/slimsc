Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to walk through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. First, it's heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I'll start by figuring out each step and what each product might be.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH (excess) at 240°C.

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo elimination reactions, specifically dehydrohalogenation, leading to alkenes. But wait, adamantane is a highly substituted structure, so the elimination would form an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on adjacent carbons (since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, I think the positions 1 and 3 are next to each other). So when KOH is used, it should eliminate HBr twice, forming a double bond.

Wait, but wait, KOH in such conditions usually leads to E2 elimination. So two elimination steps might happen? Or maybe it's a single elimination, but given that it's 1,3-dibromide, perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, 1,3 in adamantane might not be adjacent. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure of adamantane. Let me think: Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a four-carbon diamond, right? So the structure is a series of fused cyclohexane rings. So the positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons in the structure. So yes, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent carbons.

So when KOH is heated with this, it should eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a double bond between carbon 1 and 3. So product 1 would be 1,3-didehydrogenated adamantane, which would be an alkene. Wait, but wait, if each Br is on adjacent carbons, then elimination of two HBr would lead to a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane, which is an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a cage structure, so perhaps the product is more accurately called 1,3-diamantadiene? Or maybe just an Adamantylene structure.

So product 1 is an adamantylene, an alkene within the adamantane structure.

The NMR data for product 1 is given: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, 1720 is a carbonyl, but product 1 is after elimination. So perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, the first step is elimination, but the product's IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The product after heating with KOH is 1, and the 1H NMR of 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an alcohol. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or maybe an aldehyde. Hmm, but if product 1 is formed by elimination, which typically forms an alkene, why is there a carbonyl in product 1?

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of the wrong reaction. Maybe the starting material isn't a dihalide but something else. Wait, no, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so two Br atoms.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a substitution, not elimination. But KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Wait, 1,3-dibromide in presence of KOH would typically eliminate to form a double bond. But perhaps, in this case, the reaction is more like a substitution, but with two Br atoms, maybe it's an SN2 on each? But that seems unlikely because adamantane is a very rigid structure, and each carbon is probably tertiary, making SN2 less likely. So more likely elimination.

But then why the
