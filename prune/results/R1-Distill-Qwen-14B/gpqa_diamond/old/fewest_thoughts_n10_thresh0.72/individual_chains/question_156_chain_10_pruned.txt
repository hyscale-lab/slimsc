Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about dienes reacting with mCPBA. Hmm, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? I remember that it's used in epoxidation reactions. Oh wait, epoxidation is when a double bond reacts to form an epoxide. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds an oxygen across the double bond to make an epoxide.

The question says there are two reactions. Reaction 1 starts with (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral.

Wait, so what happens in each reaction? Let me think about epoxidation. mCPBA adds epoxides in a trans fashion, I think. Or is it the stereochemistry that depends on the starting alkene? Oh, maybe the configuration of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's stereochemistry.

So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite to each other. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds from the same face, so what does that do? Or wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond with specific stereochemistry. Oh right, mCPBA is an electrophilic peracid, so the reaction is an epoxidation via an electrocyclic mechanism. The peracid attacks the double bond, forming an oxirane (epoxide) with the stereochemistry determined by the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, but when mCPBA adds to an alkene, the epoxide's configuration depends on the alkene's geometry. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the resulting epoxides would have different configurations because the starting geometry is different.

Wait no, wait. Wait, mCPBA is a peracid and adds to the double bond in a way that the oxygen adds across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygens are on opposite faces? Or same face? Let me think about the mechanism. The peracid attacks the double bond in a concerted manner, leading to the formation of the epoxide. The transition state leads to the configuration of the epoxide. So the reaction is stereospecific.

For a trans (E)
