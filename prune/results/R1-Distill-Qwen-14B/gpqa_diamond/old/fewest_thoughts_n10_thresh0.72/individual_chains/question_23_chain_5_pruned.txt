Alright, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Okay, so the question is about an organic reaction involving hydrogen bromide. Hmm, the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. I need to figure out what happens when this reacts with HBr.

So, the structure of the reactant is a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), which means it's a substituted butenyl group. Let me sketch that out mentally. The butenyl chain has a double bond between C3 and C4. The substituents: on C2, there are two methyl groups, and the oxygen is on C1. So the structure is like O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, the butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl. Oh right, the double bond is between C3 and C4 of the butenyl chain. So it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, that would make it CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but from position 3, that's between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. But wait, that can't be right because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond at the end. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond at positions 2 and 3? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is at positions 3 and 4. Wait, but that's not possible because butenyl is four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH
