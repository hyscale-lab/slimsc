Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting NMR spectra. But let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different acetates: cis and trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates. 

First, I need to remember what each of these compounds looks like. Acetate esters have the structure OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. So, for propenyl acetate, R would be CH2CH=CH2, but wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? No, no. Propenyl is CH2CHCH2 but I'm getting confused. Let me think. Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. Wait, but the ester would be the acetate, so the structure would be CH3COO-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait that's propyl. Oh wait, no. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the group attached to the oxygen. So propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH=CH2, but wait, the substituents can be either cis or trans depending on the configuration around the double bond.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about propenyl and butenyl acetates. Propenyl is a three-carbon group with a double bond. So propenyl is either cis or trans. Wait, but wait, propenyl has two substituents on the double bond. So, propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. So, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2OAc. But wait, for the double bond, the configuration (cis or trans) would matter in the coupling and the NMR signals.

Alternatively, butenyl is a four-carbon group with a double bond. So butenyl could be either CH2CH2CH2CH2, but again with a double bond. Wait, but butenyl would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc or CH3CH=CHCH2OAc, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Looking at the NMR data: the question gives the shifts as 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

So, the first thing I should think about is the typical NMR signals for these types of compounds.

The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) must be the methyl group from the acetate (OAc is O-CO-OCH3, wait, no, acetate is OAc-O-R. Wait, acetate ester is CH3CO-O-R. So the methyl group in the acetate would be the OCH3. Wait, no, wait: the structure is OAc-O-R where OAc is the acetate group, which is O-CO-OCH3? No. Wait, no. Acetate ester is CH3CO-O-R. So the acetate has a methyl group attached to the carbonyl. So the methyl in the acetate would be a singlet because it's attached to a carbonyl group, which deshields it and makes it appear around 2 ppm. So in the NMR, the 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is the OCH3 from the acetate. That makes sense.

Then, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is likely a methyl group adjacent to a double bond or something. Because in allylic positions, methyl groups can show up around 1.6 ppm as a doublet. So perhaps it's a CH2CH2CH2 group, but more likely, it's a CH2 group next to a double bond. Wait, but wait, a doublet would suggest coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe it's a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to the double bond.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) is a bit tricky. Dq stands for doublet of quadruplets, but perhaps it's a doublet of doublets? Or maybe the notation is different. Wait, wait, the question says dq, which I think is doublet of quadruplets. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet and a quartet, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of doublets. Either way, the peak at 5.5 is likely a proton that's near a double bond. Maybe it's a vinyl proton, part of the double bond in the substituent.

The 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz) is a deshielded proton, probably aromatic, but wait, wait, acetate esters don't have aromatic groups. Unless the compound is part of a ring, but the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates, which are alkenes, not aromatics. Hmm. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, maybe it's a vinyl proton. The coupling constant J=16 Hz is quite large, which suggests a trans coupling between two vinyl protons. Because in alkenes, trans coupling between vicinal protons (across the double bond) can be around 15-18 Hz. So this 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which suggests that it's a proton coupled to another proton on the opposite side of a double bond. So maybe this is a trans coupling.

Wait, but why is the shift at 7.0? Because sometimes vinyl protons can be deshielded and appear around 5-7 ppm. So maybe that's a vinylic proton in a trans configuration.

Wait, putting this together. Let's consider the structure of the ester. Let's take, for example, trans-propenyl acetate. Its structure would be CH3COOCH2CH=CH2, but wait, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or maybe the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc. But wait, in that case, the substituents on the double bond are a CH2OAc and a CH2 group. So for cis and trans, the substituents would be on the same or opposite sides.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond in the middle. Or perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, perhaps I should draw some structures.

Butenyl is a four-carbon group. So butenyl could be 1-propenyl, like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's more like butenyl. Wait, but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc? No, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as a substituent? Or is it CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere else?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the substituent in the ester. For propenyl acetate, the group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. Now, the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group. So, the substituents on the double bond are a CH2OAc group and a CH2 group.

In this structure, the protons on the double bond would be the CH2=CH. The CH2=CH group would have two protons. So, the protons on the CH2=CH2 would split each other.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, suggesting that the two protons are trans to each other on the double bond. So if it's a trans configuration, the coupling would be larger. So, for example, in the trans configuration, the protons are on opposite sides, leading to a larger J value.

Wait, but in propenyl, the substituents on either side of the double bond are CH2OAc and CH2. So, when looking at the protons on the double bond, the substituents are CH2OAc and CH2.

Hmm. Let's think about the coupling between the two protons on the double bond. If the substituents are cis, the protons would be on the same side, and their coupling would be around 10-12 Hz. If trans, the coupling would be larger, around 15-18 Hz. So the J=16 Hz suggests that the two protons are trans to each other on the double bond.

So, for the propenyl group, if it's trans, then the structure would have the two substituents (CH2OAc and CH2 groups) on opposite sides of the double bond. But wait, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the substituents on the double bond are a CH2OAc and a CH2CH3 group? Wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the substituents on the double bond are a CH2-OAc and a H on one side, and a CH2CH2 on the other?

I might be getting tangled here. Let me approach this differently. Let's think about the possible structures of the options and how their NMR would look.

Option C is cis-propenyl acetate.

Option B is trans-propenyl acetate.

Option A is cis-butenyl acetate.

Option D is trans-butenyl acetate.

So for each option, I should imagine their structures and predict their NMR.

Starting with propenyl acetate (options B and C):

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group. The substituents on the double bond would be a CH2-OAc and a CH2 group.

Wait, no, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. The ester group is OAc-O-, so the R group is propenyl, which is CH2=CHCH2-. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2?

Wait, perhaps it's CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the R group is CH2-CH=CH2, making the ester CH3COOCH2CH=CH2.

Wait, but that would be an allyl group as the substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So the ester would be CH3COO-CH2CH=CH2.

So in this case, the double bond is between the second and third carbons of the propenyl group. So the structure is CH2-CH=CH2 connected to the OAc group.

Wait, no, if it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group.

In any case, the vinylic protons would be on the CH2=CH part.

So in the NMR, the vinylic protons would split each other. So, for a trans configuration, each proton would have a large coupling (J around 16 Hz), and in cis, a smaller J.

But in the given NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which suggests that the two protons are trans.

Wait, but in propenyl, there are two vinylic protons. So each would be a doublet. So why is there only one peak at 7.0 and another at 5.5?

Hmm, perhaps the two vinylic protons are not equivalent. For example, if the substituents on either side of the double bond are different, the two protons would be non-equivalent and give separate signals.

Wait, in the structure CH3COOCH2CH=CH2, the double bond is between the second and third carbons. So the structure would be:

CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2?

No, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the structure is CH3COO-CH2-CH=CH2. So the substituents on the double bond are a CH2-OAc group and a CH2 group. So the two protons on the double bond would be adjacent to these groups.

Wait, no, the double bond is between the second and third carbons. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the CH2 is attached to the OAc, and then the double bond is between the next two carbons.

Wait, but that would make the structure CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, because the propenyl group has a double bond. So CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 would be a propyl group, not propenyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, making the double bond between the second and third carbons of the substituent. So the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the substituent as CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2, so the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In that case, the substituent's double bond is between the second and third carbons. So the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2.

So the two vinylic protons (on the CH=CH2 part) would be on the same or opposite sides.

Wait, but perhaps in this structure, the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2, making it a propenyl group.

Wait, but the structure of the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. So, for propenyl, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

Wait, so the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the substituent. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that can't be, because the substituent would be CH2-CH=CH2, which is a propenyl group.

In any case, the vinylic protons would be on the CH2=CH part.

Now, considering the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16) and 5.5 (1H, dq).

If the substituent has two vinylic protons, they would each be split into a doublet. But the integrals are 1H each, so perhaps each is a doublet. Alternatively, maybe one of them is split into a more complex multiplet.

Wait, but in the given data, there are two signals: one at 7.0 (1H, d) and one at 5.5 (1H, dq). So perhaps each of the two vinylic protons is coupled to more than just each other.

Wait, perhaps one of them is coupled to another proton elsewhere, like a neighboring CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is longer, like butenyl.

Wait, but let's think about the other NMR signals. There's a 1.6 ppm (3H, d). That's a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group, perhaps. So if the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's butyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to a double bond.

Wait, for butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's a longer chain. Alternatively, butenyl could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So the substituent is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But that would make the substituent longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, making it butenyl. In that case, the substituent's structure would have a double bond in the middle.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the coupling in the NMR.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which is a large coupling, so probably between two trans vinylic protons.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (or some other splitting), perhaps coupled to two different protons.

Now, let's think about the possible structures.

In trans-propenyl acetate, the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2, and the double bond is between the first and second carbons. The substituents on either side of the double bond are CH2-OAc and CH2 groups. So the two vinylic protons would be on the CH=CH2 part. In the trans configuration, those two protons would be on opposite sides, leading to a larger coupling (J=16 Hz). So the 7.0 ppm peak is one of the vinylic protons, coupled to the other with J=16.

But what about the other vinylic proton? Why is it appearing at 5.5 and as a dq?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is longer, like butenyl, which would have more protons.

Wait, another approach: Let's count the protons indicated in the NMR.

The NMR shows:

- 7.0 (1H, d)
- 5.5 (1H, dq)
- 2.1 (3H, s)
- 1.6 (3H, d)

Total of 1+1+3+3 =8 protons. But wait, the molecule would have more than that. Wait, no, perhaps the integration is just for the protons in the substituent.

Wait, but the molecule is an ester, so the structure is CH3CO-O-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group.

Assuming R is propenyl: R would be CH2=CHCH2-O-. So the substituent has 3 carbons, with a double bond.

So for propenyl, the substituent has 3 carbons, so R has 3 carbons.

So the substituent's structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH=CH2

Wait, no, the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2, so the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2.

The substituent has three carbons: CH2, CH, and CH2.

Wait, no, the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2, which is three carbons in a row, with the double bond between first and second carbons.

So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this structure, the vinylic protons are on the CH=CH2 part.

So, the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2, so the vinylic protons are at the end, on the CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the two vinylic protons are on the same carbon. No, that can't be right.

Wait, no, in propenyl, the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2 attached to OAc. So the substituent has a double bond between the first and second carbons, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So the structure would be:

CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this structure, the vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part.

Wait, then the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons, and the third carbon is a CH2 group.

So in this case, the two vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part. Each of these protons is attached to a CH2 group (on the left) and a CH2 group (on the right?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each vinylic proton is attached to a CH2 group. So each vinylic proton would have neighboring protons.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the NMR again.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) is one vinylic proton, coupled to another vinylic proton with a large J. The other vinylic proton is at 5.5 (dq), which suggests it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

Wait, but why would a vinylic proton be a doublet of quadruplets? Maybe it's coupled to two different protons. For example, if the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-OAc, then the vinylic protons (on the CH=CH) are each coupled to the adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is longer, like butenyl, which would have more protons.

Wait, but the substituent in the options is either propenyl or butenyl. So let's consider butenyl.

Butenyl would have four carbons in the substituent, with a double bond. So for example, CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, perhaps. Or maybe the double bond is somewhere else.

Alternatively, the substituent could be CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OAc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals again.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) suggests a vinylic proton coupled to another trans vinylic proton.

The 5.5 ppm (dq) might be a proton that's coupled to both a vinylic proton and another adjacent proton, like a CH2 group.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is probably a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group that's next to a double bond. So it's an allylic methyl group.

So in the substituent, perhaps there's a CH2 group next to a double bond, which is connected to a CH(CH3) group? Wait, no, the substituent is either propenyl or butenyl.

Wait, another thought: for butenyl acetate, the structure could be CH3COO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But that would have a longer chain.

In that case, the substituent would have a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. The vinylic protons would be on the CH=CH2 part. So the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the two vinylic protons would each be coupled to each other with a trans J around 16 Hz. So each would appear as a doublet.

But then why are there only two vinylic peaks? Because in the given NMR, there are two vinylic signals: 7.0 (d) and 5.5 (dq). So perhaps the substituent's structure makes the two vinylic protons have different environments.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's structure is such that one vinylic proton is next to a CH2 group and the other is next to a CH group. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc, making it a butenyl group with the double bond in the middle.

Wait, in that case, the substituent would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2. Wait, that can't be right because it's five carbons. No, the substituent would be four carbons (butenyl), making it CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc.

In this case, the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc, so the double bond is between the second and third carbons.

Now, the vinylic protons are on the CH=CH part. Each of these protons would be coupled to each other with a J around 16 Hz (trans). Additionally, each would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 groups.

So for the proton on the left (CH2-CH=), it's next to a CH2 group on the left and a CH= on the right. So that proton would have coupling with both the adjacent CH2 protons and the vinylic proton. Similarly, the proton on the right (CH=CH2-) would be coupled to the vinylic proton and the adjacent CH2 group.

Hmm, but in the NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet (coupled to one proton, J=16). The 5.5 is a dq, which suggests coupling to two different sets of protons, perhaps the adjacent CH2 and the vinylic.

Wait, but let me think about the integrating. The 7.0 ppm is 1H, which would be one of the vinylic protons. The 5.5 is 1H, perhaps the other vinylic proton. The 1.6 ppm is a 3H doublet, which would correspond to a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 that's next to the double bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc, but with a methyl group on one of the CH2 groups.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm. So perhaps it's a CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Or perhaps a CH2 connected to a CH2 group that's attached to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OAc, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2? Hmm, but that would introduce more signals.

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond. So the structure would have a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-OAc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The substituent has a double bond, and a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to the double bond. So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-OAc? No, that seems complicated.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH-OAc. But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Wait, that would be isopropenyl acetate, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to a CH that's connected to a CH2 with a methyl group. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-OAc. No, not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's try another approach. The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group. So maybe the substituent has a structure like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. So, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3). Wait, no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-OAc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc, but with a methyl group on one of the CH2 groups. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2. But that would be a butenyl group, and the substituent would have four carbons.

Wait, in that case, the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between the second and third carbons.

In this structure, the vinylic protons are on the CH=CH part. Each would be coupled to each other with J=16 Hz (trans configuration), and each would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 groups.

So the left vinylic proton (on the CH) is adjacent to a CH2 group (connected to OAc), and the right vinylic proton (on the CH2) is adjacent to another CH2 group.

So the left vinylic proton (CH) would be next to a CH2 group, so it would couple with the protons on that CH2. Similarly, the right vinylic proton (CH2) would couple with the protons on the adjacent CH2.

So in the NMR, each vinylic proton would appear as a doublet due to coupling with the other vinylic proton (J=16 Hz), and a triplet or quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 protons.

Wait, but the given data has the 7.0 as a doublet (so only coupled to one proton, J=16) and the 5.5 as a dq, perhaps coupled to two different sets of protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that one of the vinylic protons is also coupled to a CH2 group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but the substituent in the options is either propenyl or butenyl, so perhaps the substituent is butenyl, with a CH2 group next to the double bond.

So, let's imagine the substituent is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, that would be a longer chain, but in that case, the vinylic protons would be on the CH=CH2 part, and might have different coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which would make the substituent a butenyl group with the double bond between the first and second carbons.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. The vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part.

So the vinylic protons would be on the CH2=CH group. Each would be coupled to each other (J=16 Hz for trans) and perhaps to the adjacent CH2 group.

So the left vinylic proton (CH2) would be next to a CH2 group and a vinylic proton. The right vinylic proton (CH) would be next to a CH2 group and a vinylic proton.

Thus, each vinylic proton would have coupling to the other (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 protons.

So perhaps the 7.0 ppm peak is one vinylic proton, which is coupled to the other vinylic proton (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 protons. But the 5.5 ppm peak is the other vinylic proton, which is coupled to the same way.

Wait, but the 5.5 is a dq, which implies coupling to two different sets of protons. Maybe each vinylic proton is coupled to two different CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the vinylic protons is also coupled to a methyl group. But the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group, which is a doublet, so it's attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to the double bond.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. Wait, that would be a branching point, but that might not fit the options given.

Wait, the options are all either cis or trans for propenyl and butenyl acetates. So perhaps it's propenyl acetate.

Let me think about the structure of trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this structure, the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2. The double bond is between the second and third carbons? Or first and second?

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In this case, the two vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part. So each is attached to a CH2 group (left) and a CH2 group (right). Wait, no. The substituent is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this structure. Let me visualize it.

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH=CH2

So the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2. The double bond is between the CH and CH2.

In this structure, the two vinylic protons are on the CH=CH2 part. Each is attached to a CH and a CH2 group.

Each of these protons would be coupled to each other (J=16 Hz for trans) and to the adjacent CH2 groups.

So the left vinylic proton (on the CH) is next to a CH2 group (on the left) and a CH2 group (on the right). Wait, no, the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2, so the left CH2 is connected to OAc, and the right is a CH2.

So each vinylic proton would be coupled to the other (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 groups.

Thus, the vinylic proton on the CH would have coupling to the adjacent CH2 (which is the OAc-attached CH2) and to the vinylic proton.

So the splitting would be a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

But in the NMR data, one is a doublet (7.0, J=16) and the other is a dq (5.5).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is trans-propenyl acetate, so the substituent is CH2-CH=CH2, with the two vinylic protons on opposite sides.

In that case, the left vinylic proton (on the CH) would be coupled to the other vinylic proton (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 group's protons.

So the left vinylic proton would be a triplet (coupled to two protons on the adjacent CH2 and the vinylic proton).

Wait, but the data shows 7.0 ppm as a doublet, which would mean only one coupling. So perhaps the left vinylic proton is only coupled to the other vinylic proton (J=16) and not to the adjacent CH2 group because the CH2 is in a different plane or something.

Alternatively, maybe the adjacent CH2 is a singlet, but that's not possible because CH2 would have two protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that one of the vinylic protons is coupled only to the other vinylic proton, while the other vinylic proton is coupled to both the other vinylic proton and another proton, such as an adjacent CH2 group.

So, for example, the left vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm) is coupled only to the other vinylic proton (J=16), making it a doublet. The right vinylic proton (at 5.5 ppm) is coupled to both the left vinylic proton (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 group's protons, which may cause it to split into a doublet of doublets or a quartet.

But then why is the 5.5 peak a doublet of quadruplets (dq)? Because it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the right vinylic proton is adjacent to a CH2 group, which has two protons. So the right vinylic proton would couple with both the left vinylic proton (J=16) and the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group (each with a smaller J, say around 6-8 Hz). That could cause it to split into a quartet, but the question says it's a dq, which might be a doublet of quartets or a quartet of doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the right vinylic proton is coupled to two different protons, leading to a doublet of doublets, which could appear as a quartet, but the 'dq' notation might be a bit unclear.

Additionally, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to the double bond. So perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, which would be an isopropenyl group, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-OAc. No, that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, but then the 1.6 ppm would be a different group.

Wait, but the substituent is either propenyl or butenyl, so perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, making the substituent propenyl. But then where does the 1.6 ppm come from?

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) might be a methyl group attached to the same carbon as the double bond. For example, if the substituent is CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-OAc. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (if the substituent is propenyl), but wait, that would make it a substituent with a methyl group on the double bond.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2-OAc. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3, with a methyl group on C2. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2-OAc.

In this structure, the vinylic protons are on the C(CH3)=CH2 part. Each would be coupled to each other (J=16 Hz for trans) and to the adjacent CH2 group.

But then the 1.6 ppm would be the methyl group on C2, which is adjacent to the double bond. The methyl group would be a singlet if it's attached to a CH with no neighboring protons, but in this case, the CH is attached to the double bond, which is attached to a CH2 group. So the methyl group would be a singlet because it's attached to a sp2 carbon, which doesn't have neighboring protons. So the 1.6 ppm would be a singlet, but in the data, it's a doublet, so that can't be right.

Hmm.

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the NMR data and think about the splitting patterns.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, so it's coupled to one proton, likely another vinylic proton in a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm is a dq, which suggests it's coupled to two different sets of protons. Perhaps one set is the trans vinylic proton (J=16) and another set from a neighboring CH2 group (J around 6-8 Hz).

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests it's a methyl group next to a CH2 that has two protons. So the methyl group is attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2 or something that causes splitting.

So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc, but with a methyl group on one of the CH2 groups.

Wait, but that would make the substituent CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH-OAc. No, that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc, where the CH2 next to the double bond has a methyl group attached. So the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentenyl group, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate.

So the substituent is either propenyl or butenyl, and either cis or trans.

I think the key here is to look at the coupling constants and the splitting to determine the structure.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) suggests that the proton is coupled to one other proton with a large J, which is typical for trans coupling across a double bond.

The other vinylic proton is at 5.5 ppm, which is a dq. Perhaps it's coupled to two different protons: the trans vinylic proton (J=16) and another proton (like a CH2) with a smaller J.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 that's next to the double bond. So the substituent must have a CH2 group next to a double bond, which in turn is connected to a CH group with a methyl.

Wait, that might make sense. So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2-OAc. No, that would be a butenyl group. So the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. Hmm, but that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH(CH3).

In this case, the substituent is a propenyl group with a methyl branch on the third carbon.

But that's not one of the options. The options are either propenyl or butenyl in cis or trans configurations, without branching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is butenyl with a methyl group on the CH2 next to the double bond.

So the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-OAc.

In this structure, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH-OAc.

So the double bond is between the third and fourth carbons. The CH(CH3) is on the second carbon.

In this case, the vinylic protons are on the third and fourth carbons.

The vinylic proton on the third carbon (CH) would be adjacent to a CH(CH3) group, and the one on the fourth carbon (CH2) would be adjacent to a CH2 group.

So the vinylic proton on the third carbon would be coupled to the vinylic proton on the fourth (J=16) and to the CH(CH3) group's protons.

Wait, but the CH(CH3) has two protons, which would cause splitting. So the vinylic proton on the third carbon would be a triplet due to coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH(CH3) group and a doublet due to coupling with the vinylic proton on the fourth carbon. So that would result in a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets, which could appear as a more complex splitting pattern.

The vinylic proton on the fourth carbon (CH2) would be coupled to the vinylic proton on the third (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 group's protons.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc, which is a butenyl group with the double bond between the first and second carbons.

In this case, the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc.

The vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part. Each would be coupled to each other (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 groups.

The left vinylic proton (CH2) would be next to a CH2 group, and the right vinylic proton (CH) would be next to a CH2 group.

So the left vinylic proton would be a triplet (coupled to the two protons on the adjacent CH2 and the vinylic proton), and the right vinylic proton would be a triplet as well.

But the NMR data shows one as a doublet and the other as a dq.

Hmm.

Another angle: the presence of a doublet at 7.0 (J=16) suggests a trans coupling, so trans configuration around the double bond.

The 5.5 (dq) could be a proton that is coupled to two different protons, perhaps a vinylic proton (J=16) and a CH2 group proton (J=6).

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to the double bond.

So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc, where the CH2 next to the double bond has a methyl group. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2 with a methyl on the CH2.

Wait, but that would require the substituent to have a longer chain, which would be butenyl.

Alternatively, the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-OAc, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc, making it a propenyl group with a methyl branch on the third carbon.

But that would make the substituent structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH(CH3).

In this structure, the substituent is CH2-CH=CH(CH3). The vinylic protons would be on the CH=CH(CH3) part.

The left vinylic proton (on CH) is coupled to the other vinylic proton (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 group. The right vinylic proton (on CH(CH3)) is coupled to the left vinylic proton and to the adjacent CH3.

Wait, but the CH3 is a methyl group, which is attached to the CH. So the right vinylic proton would be coupled to the methyl group's protons, but a singlet. So that would cause the right vinylic proton to be split into a doublet of doublets.

But the 5.5 ppm is a dq, which could fit this scenario.

In this structure, the left vinylic proton (on CH) would be a doublet due to coupling with the right vinylic proton (J=16), making it the 7.0 ppm peak. The right vinylic proton (on CH(CH3)) would be coupled to the left (J=16) and to the methyl group's protons (J around 6-8 Hz), causing it to split into a doublet of doublets, which might be the 5.5 ppm peak.

The methyl group (CH3) attached to the CH would appear as a singlet if it's attached to a CH without neighboring protons, but in this case, the CH is attached to a double bond, so the CH3 would be a singlet. But the NMR shows a 1.6 ppm (3H, d), which is a doublet, so that can't be. Therefore, this structure may not fit.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OAc, but with a methyl group on one of the CH2 groups.

Wait, but without more info, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another approach: the presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H) indicates a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, likely the acetate's OCH3 group.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond.

In the case of propenyl acetate, the substituent would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part.

The substituent's structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In this structure, the substituent's CH2=CH group has two vinylic protons. These would each be coupled to each other (J=16 for trans).

So each would be a doublet.

But in the NMR, there's only one vinylic signal at 7.0 (d, J=16) and another at 5.5 (dq). So perhaps one of the vinylic protons is also coupled to another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH=CH-OAc, but that would be a propenyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, which is propenyl.

In that case, the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part.

Each vinylic proton is attached to a CH2 group and a CH group.

The left vinylic proton (on CH2) would be next to a CH group and a CH2 group. The right vinylic proton (on CH) would be next to a CH2 group.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part. For trans configuration, the substituent would have the two vinylic protons on opposite sides.

In this case, each vinylic proton would be a doublet due to coupling with each other (J=16).

But the NMR shows one as a doublet and the other as a dq. So perhaps one of them is also coupled to another proton, such as a neighboring CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. So the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-OAc.

In this case, the substituent has a methyl branch on the third carbon.

The vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part. The left vinylic proton (on CH2) would be coupled to the right vinylic proton (J=16) and to the adjacent CH(CH3) group's protons.

The CH(CH3) group has two protons, so the left vinylic proton would be a triplet due to coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH(CH3) group and a doublet due to the vinylic coupling. So that would make a doublet of triplets, which could appear as a more complex pattern, perhaps a quintet.

But the NMR shows one as a doublet and the other as a dq, so this may not fit.

Hmm.

Another thought: the presence of a doublet at 1.6 ppm suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's split by two protons. So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH-OAc. But that's getting too complex.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc, making it a butenyl group. In that case, the substituent's structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc.

The vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part. Each would be coupled to each other (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 groups.

The left vinylic proton (on CH2) would be next to a CH2 group, leading to coupling with the two protons on that CH2 group. So the left vinylic proton (J=16 from the other vinylic proton and J=6-8 from the adjacent CH2) would be a triplet. The right vinylic proton (on CH) would be coupled to the left vinylic (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 group's protons, making it a triplet as well.

But the given data shows one as a doublet and the other as a dq, so this may not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, making it a propenyl group. The substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

In this case, the vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH part. Each would be coupled to each other (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 group.

The left vinylic proton (on CH2) would be coupled to the right vinylic (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 (J=6-8), making it a triplet. The right vinylic proton (on CH) would be coupled to the left (J=16) and to the adjacent CH2 (J=6-8), making it a triplet as well.

But the NMR data shows one as a doublet and the other as a dq, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, and the left vinylic proton is only coupled to the right one (J=16), making it a doublet, while the right vinylic proton is coupled to both the left and the adjacent CH2 group, making it a triplet. But the data shows the right one as a dq.

Hmm.

Another angle: The presence of a doublet at 5.5 suggests that this proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, one of which is the vinylic proton (J=16) and another from a neighboring group.

So perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, and the right vinylic proton is also coupled to the adjacent CH2 group's protons.

Wait, but in that case, the right vinylic proton (on CH) would be coupled to the left vinylic (J=16) and to the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group (J=6-8), making it a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets, which might look like a dq.

So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (trans configuration).

In this case:

- The left vinylic proton (on CH2) would be at higher ppm (around 7.0) because it's more deshielded. It would be coupled only to the right vinylic proton (J=16), making it a doublet.

- The right vinylic proton (on CH) would be at lower ppm (around 5.5) and coupled to the left vinylic (J=16) and to the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group (J=6-8), making it a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets, which could appear as a dq.

That fits the data.

In this structure, the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (trans configuration), so the correct option would be trans-propenyl acetate, which is option B.

Wait, but wait. The substituent in this case is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, which is a propenyl group, and the configuration is trans.

So the correct answer would be option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

But let me check the options again. Option B is Trans-propenyl acetate.

Yes, that would make sense.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester (CH3COO-), which is typically a singlet due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyl group.

2. **The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H)** indicates a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group, likely in an allylic position (next to a double bond).

3. **The 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, J = 16.0 Hz)** suggests a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton with a large trans coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), typical of a trans configuration around a double bond.

4. **The 5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets (1H, dq)** indicates a vinylic proton coupled to two different sets of protons: one vinylic proton (J ≈ 16 Hz) and another set of protons, likely from an adjacent CH2 group (smaller J values).

### Structural Considerations:
- The compound is an ester of the form CH3COO-R, where R is either a propenyl or butenyl group.
- The splitting patterns and chemical shifts suggest the presence of a double bond in the R group, with vinylic protons exhibiting trans coupling (J = 16 Hz).
- The 1.6 ppm doublet corresponds to a methyl group attached to a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond, consistent with a propenyl or butenyl group.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Cis-butenyl acetate (A)**:  
   - The double bond in butenyl is between carbons 2 and 3.  
   - In the cis configuration, the vinylic protons would have a smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 10–12 Hz), which does not match the observed J = 16 Hz.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

2. **Trans-propenyl acetate (B)**:  
   - The structure is CH3COO-CH2-CH=CH2, with the double bond between carbons 1 and 2.  
   - In the trans configuration, the vinylic protons on CH2=CH exhibit a large trans coupling constant (J = 16 Hz).  
   - The left vinylic proton (on CH2) appears as a doublet at 7.0 ppm, while the right vinylic proton (on CH) is coupled to both the trans vinylic proton and the adjacent CH2 group, resulting in the dq at 5.5 ppm.  
   - The 1.6 ppm doublet corresponds to the methyl group on the CH2 adjacent to the double bond.  
   - This option matches the data.

3. **Cis-propenyl acetate (C)**:  
   - Similar to trans-propenyl acetate, but in the cis configuration.  
   - The vinylic protons would have a smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 10–12 Hz), which does not match the observed J = 16 Hz.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

4. **Trans-butenyl acetate (D)**:  
   - The structure is CH3COO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4.  
   - The vinylic protons on CH=CH2 would exhibit smaller coupling constants (J ≈ 10–12 Hz) due to the longer chain, which does not match the observed J = 16 Hz.  
   - This option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data is most consistent with **Trans-propenyl acetate (B)**, as it explains the large trans coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), the splitting patterns, and the chemical shifts observed in the spectrum.

**Answer: B**
