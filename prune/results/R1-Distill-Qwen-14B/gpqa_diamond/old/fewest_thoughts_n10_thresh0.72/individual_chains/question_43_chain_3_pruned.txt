Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC nomenclature. But let's take it step by step.

The question describes a benzene ring with several substituents, and I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name. Let me try to visualize the structure based on the description.

First, the problem states: the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid (which would be the -COOH group), a carbaldehyde (CHO), and a cyano group (CN) all meta to one another. So, meta means each of these groups is separated by one carbon in between. So, if I imagine the benzene ring, the carboxylic acid is in position 1, then the next meta position is 3, and the next would be 5. But wait, I should think about how they're arranged relative to each other.

Wait, the problem says all three are meta to one another. Hmm. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the next meta would be position 3, and the one after that would be position 5. So, the three groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are at positions 1, 3, and 5. But wait, the carboxylic acid is also attached to the benzene ring as the principal functional group, right? Because the suffix is -oic acid, so the numbering starts from that.

Wait, the main functional group here is the carboxylic acid group because it's the principal functional group. So the numbering should start such that the COOH is at position 1.

So, the benzene ring is numbered starting with COOH as position 1. Then, the other substituents are arranged around it.

Next, the problem says: Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2) group. So, ortho to position 1 (COOH) would be positions 2 and 6. So, two substituents are at positions 2 and 6.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group." So, para to COOH
