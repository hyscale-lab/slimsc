Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Let's see what other info I have.

So, both planets have the same mass. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Hmm.

Wait, transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher if the planet's orbit is more likely to edge-on, right? Because the transit only occurs when the planet passes directly in front of the star from our point of view.

But I'm a bit confused about the formula for transit probability. I think it's something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance's impact parameter or something. Oh right, the formula for transit probability is approximately (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the alignment.

Wait, no, another thought. The probability of a planet transiting is proportional to (R_s / a) * (R_p / R_s), where R_s is the star's radius, R_p the planet's radius. Or maybe I'm mixing up some terms.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a? No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I recall that the probability is approximately (R_p / (a(1-e^2)) ) * (1 / sin i), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's (R_p / a) * (1 / sin i), but without knowing the inclination, which is a problem because we don't know the orientation of the orbit. Oh wait, but in reality, the probability of the planet's orbit being edge-on enough for a transit depends on the star's size relative to the planet's orbit.

Wait, another approach. The probability that a planet transits is roughly (R_* / a), where R_* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis (distance from
