Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with the VLT. The key here is determining the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) each star would produce. The requirement is that the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel after a 1-hour exposure.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for radial velocity measurements. It's known for its precision, but its detectability depends on several factors such as the brightness of the star, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency.

Each star has different characteristics. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star, probably one of the brightest in the sky. So, it's definitely going to be detectable because bright stars provide strong signals. I'll count this as detectable.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is also a bright star, though I think it's a bit dimmer than Canopus. But still, it's a prominent star, so it should have a high enough S/N. So, detectable.

Option c) Star with V=15, 10 pc distance. Wait, wait. Absolute magnitude (Mv) is 15. But to get apparent magnitude (mv), we can use the distance modulus. The formula is mv = Mv + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So d=10 pc: log(10/10)=0, so mv=15. What's the apparent magnitude? Well, the fainter the star, the higher the magnitude. Wait, but wait, ESPRESSO's performance depends on the star's brightness. So a star with mv=15 is very faint. Wait, but I thought that ESPRESSO is used for bright stars. Hmm, I need to remember the typical magnitude range ESPRESSO can handle. From what I recall, ESPRESSO works best for stars around V=9 to V=15, but that's for certain purposes. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The V magnitude's lower is brighter. So 15 is quite faint. Let me check the ESPRESSO's capability. Oh, I think ESPRESSO has a design that allows it to work with a wide range, but perhaps the signal depends on the star's flux. Alternatively, the S/N depends on the photon flux, which depends on the star's brightness and the exposure time.

Wait, the formula for S/N ratio per pixel is proportional to (flux)^0.5 multiplied by the exposure time. Or perhaps more accurately, the S/N scales with sqrt(exposure time * flux). Because the noise is dominated by shot noise, which scales with the square root of the number of photons.

So, for each star, I need to calculate the expected S/N. But I don't have the exact numbers, so perhaps I can compare them relative to each other.

Wait, but maybe I can use the formula for the signal-to-noise ratio in spectroscopy. The S/N per pixel (for a given exposure time) depends
