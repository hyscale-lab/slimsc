Okay, so I've got this science problem here about a supermassive black hole and its entropy. Hmm, I remember that entropy of a black hole is related to its area, right? Oh wait, the formula is something like S = (A * k) / (4 * ħ * c^3), where A is the area of the event horizon, k is Boltzmann's constant, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Yeah, I think that's right.

The question gives the angular size θ and the distance d to the galaxy. So I need to find the radius of the event horizon first. Wait, how do I find the radius from the angular size and distance? Oh, right, the formula θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse, which is the radius r over distance d when θ is small. So r = d * θ.

But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first. The given θ is 1e-17 degrees. To convert to radians, multiply by π/180. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180.

Calculating that: 1e-17 * 3.1416 / 180. Let's see, 3.1416/180 is about 0.0174533. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, but I need to convert parsecs to meters because the standard units for physics are meters, kilograms, seconds. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So the radius r = d * θ_rad = (3.086e26 m) * (1.745e-19 rad) = let me calculate that. 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = let's approximate.

3e26 * 1.7e-19 = 5.1
