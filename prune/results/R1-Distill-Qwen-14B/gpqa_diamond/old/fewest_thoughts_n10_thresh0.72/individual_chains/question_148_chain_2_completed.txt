--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and their properties, and we need to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.

Hmm, let me break down the information given.

First, substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. From the data, the oF (I think that's the oxidation state or maybe something else—wait, oF might stand for the oxygen-free or something, but more likely, it's the oxidation state of fluorine. Wait, the ɷF is 31.96%. Oh, wait, perhaps that's the mole fraction of F or the weight percent? Or maybe it's the oxidation state? Actually, 31.96% sounds like a percentage by weight. So if A2 is a binary compound, and the fluorine content is 31.96%, perhaps we'll need to figure out the formula.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is an oxidizing agent, it must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps A1 is a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y in a 1:1 molar ratio. So, if Y reacts with F2 in 1:1, then A3's formula would be YF. But wait, Y is an element, so the formula would be YF. But is that possible? Well, for example, if Y is sodium, which can form NaF, but that's 1:1. Alternatively, perhaps Y is in a higher oxidation state. Wait, but the formula is YF, so that would imply Y has a +1 charge, which is possible for Group 1 elements. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Then, by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, we get A5. Hmm, adding Y to A4 gives A5. A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. So maybe A5 is a salt that breaks down into two products when water is present. For example, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, let's think about each compound.

A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the decomposition reaction might be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Or maybe it's more about the oxidation state. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a diatomic molecule, but probably not since it's a binary compound with Y and F. Wait, fluorine is F, so Y is another element.

Wait, but the initial statement says five binary compounds of fluorine with Y are known. So Y can combine with F in five different ways, probably varying oxidation states.

So Y could be a metal that can exhibit multiple oxidation states with F. For example, lead can form PbF2, PbF3, PbF4, etc., but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen? No, because oxygen is in group VIA and forms OF2, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1. Let's consider the decomposition of a binary compound. For example, perhaps A1 is YF5, and upon decomposition, it forms YF3 and F2? Or maybe YF3 and something else.

Wait, the decomposition produces F2, so fluorine gas is released. Let's think about the fluorine content.

In A1, when it decomposes, F2 is produced. So perhaps A1 is a compound where Y is in a lower oxidation state, and upon decomposition, Y's oxidation state increases, releasing F2.

Wait, but fluorine is in its highest oxidation state (since F is -1 in compounds). Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF, which upon decomposition produces YF3 and F2? Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF3. Wait, no, if you decompose YF3, you might get YF2 and F2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the decomposition produces F2, which suggests that the reaction is releasing F2 gas. So maybe the decomposition is something like 2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2. Let me check the fluorine percentages.

Wait, in the decomposition, A1 → A2 + F2. So A2 is a product. Let's say the formula of A1 is YF_n, and upon decomposition, it produces A2 (YF_m) and F2.

Wait, but let me think about the fluorine content in A2. The ɷF is 31.96% by weight. Let's compute what that implies. So, if the molecular weight of A2 is M, then the weight of F in A2 is 0.3196 * M.

Each F atom is 19 g/mol. Let's say A2 is YF_x. Then, the molecular weight of A2 is Y's atomic weight plus x*19.

So, the percentage of F is (x*19) / (Y + x*19) ) * 100% = 31.96%.

Hmm. Let me try to find x and Y.

Let me rearrange the equation:

x*19 / (Y + 19x) = 0.3196

Multiply both sides by denominator:

x*19 = 0.3196 (Y + 19x)

19x = 0.3196 Y + 0.3196 *19 x

19x - (0.3196 *19)x = 0.3196 Y

x [19 - (0.3196 *19) ] = 0.3196 Y

Calculate 0.3196 *19: approximately 6.0724.

So,

x (19 - 6.0724) = 0.3196 Y

x *12.9276 = 0.3196 Y.

So,

Y = (x * 12.9276) / 0.3196 ≈ x *40.54.

So Y ≈40.54 x.

Since Y is an element, and x is the number of F atoms in A2 (a positive integer), and Y must be a reasonable atomic weight (like around 20-100, perhaps).

If x=1: Y≈40.54.

But elements with atomic weight around 40.54 are like zinc (Zn is ~65.4), but 40 is close to titanium (47.867), but wait, 40 is around the atomic weight of Zr? No, Zr is about 91.22. Hmm, maybe Y is titanium? No, that's about 47.87.

Wait, if x=2: Y≈81.08. Which is close to lead (Pb is 207.2), but wait, that's higher. Alternatively, 81 is close to thallium (around 204.2), but that's not right. Wait, 81 is near the atomic weight of yttrium (Y is about 88.91), but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait,

Let me compute 19 * (1 - 0.3196) = 19 * 0.6804 = approx 12.9276.

So,

x *12.9276 = 0.3196 Y → Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * x ≈ (40.54) * x.

Hmm. So for x=1, Y≈40.54. That's around 40, which is close to titanium (47.87), but not exact. For x=2, Y≈81.08. Looking for elements in that region: strontium is around 87.62, yttrium is 88.91, which is close to 81.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's see the possible Y candidates.

Alternatively, maybe Y is lead (Pb, atomic weight ~207). Let's see:

If Y is Pb, then:

Pb's atomic weight is about 207.2.

So, Y is 207.2. Then, 207.2 =40.54 *x → x≈5.11. So not an integer. So that doesn't fit.

Another thought: perhaps Y is a transition metal with a high atomic weight. Let's see. Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe A2 is YF3.

Let me compute the fluorine percentage for YF3.

The formula would be YF3.

Molecular weight of YF3: Y + 3*19 = Y +57.

Fluorine percentage is (3*19)/(Y+57) *100% = 57/(Y+57)*100.

Set that equal to 31.96%:

57/(Y+57) = 0.3196 → Y+57 =57/0.3196 ≈178.3 → Y≈178.3-57=121.3.

But the atomic weight of lead is ~207, tin is ~118.71. Oh, 121 is close to tin (Sn, ~118.71). So Y would be tin, but wait, tin is in group IV, and forms SnF2, SnF4, etc.

Wait, if Y is tin (Sn, ~118.71 g/mol), then YF3 would have molecular weight 118.71 + 57 =175.71.

Fluorine percentage: (57)/(175.71) *100 ≈32.43%. Which is close to 31.96%.

Hmm, that's pretty close. So perhaps A2 is SnF3.

Wait, but does tin form SnF3? I think tin generally forms SnF2 and SnF4. Let me check: Sn typically has +2 and +4 oxidation states. So SnF2 is tin(II) fluoride, SnF4 is tin(IV) fluoride. So SnF3 is less common. Maybe it's a polymeric form or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, let's try Y as lead (Pb, ~207.2 g/mol). Then, let's see if the fluorine percentage works for a certain x.

Suppose A2 is PbF2.

Molecular weight: 207.2 + 38 =245.2. F percentage: (38)/(245.2) *100 ≈15.5%, which is less than 31.96.

If A2 is PbF4: 207.2 + 76=283.2. F%: (76/283.2)*100≈26.85%. Still less than 31.96.

Hmm. Not enough.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A2 is YF, but let's compute.

YF: Y +19.

F%: 19/(Y+19)*100=31.96 → 19/(Y+19)=0.3196 → Y+19=19/0.3196 ≈59.4 → Y≈40.4.

So Y would be about 40.4. What's the element with atomic weight near 40? Titanium is 47.87, but 40 is around Zr (zirconium is 91, which is higher). Wait, perhaps it's not YF.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is calcium (Ca, ~40.08 g/mol). So Y=40.

So Y is Ca.

If A2 is CaF2. Then, F% is (2*19)/(40 +38)*100=38/78 *100≈48.7%, which is higher than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need to approach it differently.

Wait, the problem states that adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, perhaps A4 is a salt, and adding Y (as a metal) to it would cause a reaction.

Wait, what kind of salts react with metals upon heating? Maybe a salt that is hydrolyzed when heated, but when a metal is added, it causes a decomposition.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoro compound, and adding Y (the element) in 1:1 ratio produces a precipitate or another compound.

Wait, going back to the problem: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y in a 1:1 molar ratio. So A3 is YF.

If Y is in +1 oxidation state, that would suggest a Group 1 element. But Group 1 elements typically form +1 ions. So maybe Y is a Group 1 element.

Wait, but Group 1 elements form binary fluorides like YF (if Y is Na, for example, NaF). But let me think: for Y being sodium (Na, atomic weight ~23), A3 would be NaF.

Then, adding Y (Na metal) in 1:1 ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4. What would happen?

Wait, if A4 is, say, a sodium fluoride solution? No, but A4 is a binary compound of Y and F, so perhaps A4 is NaF. But when you add Na metal to NaF solution, perhaps nothing happens because Na is already in the +1 state.

Hmm, perhaps A4 is something else. Maybe A4 is a higher fluoride of Na, like NaF2 or NaF3, but those are less common.

Wait, another angle. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. If A1 is YF3 and upon decomposition gives YF and F2, but that might not fit the fluorine percentages.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF5, which decomposes into YF3 and F2. Let's check the fluorine percentage in A2.

If A2 is YF3, then as calculated earlier, Y would be around 118.71 (tin), but that might not fit. Alternatively, if Y is lead, then YF3 would have a different percentage.

Wait, perhaps A1 is YF3, which upon decomposition produces YF and F2. Let me see. YF3 → YF + F2.

But I'm not sure if that's a feasible decomposition reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF4, which decomposes into YF2 and F2. Let's compute the fluorine percentage for YF2.

Assume A2 is YF2.

Fluorine percentage would be (2*19)/(Y+38) *100 =31.96%.

So,

(38)/(Y +38) = 0.3196 → Y +38 =38/0.3196 ≈118.9 → Y≈80.9.

So Y would be around 81. Looking for an element with atomic weight ~81. That's strontium (Sr, ~87.62) is higher, but perhaps yttrium is ~88.91. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but perhaps Y is yttrium (Y is named Y, which could be confusing, but let's proceed).

Wait, Y=81 would be near the atomic weight of something like thallium (Tl, ~204.2) is too high, but perhaps it's another element.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of Y as aluminum (Al, ~27). Let's see:

If A2 is AlF3, then the molecular weight is 27 +57=84.

F%: (57)/(84)*100≈67.86%, which is higher than 31.96. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the other parts of the problem.

A3 can interact with xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so perhaps A3 is a strong oxidizing agent. If A3 is YF, and Y is +1, then perhaps it's a strong enough oxidizing agent to react with Xe.

Wait, but Group 1 metals typically don't form strong oxidizing agents as their fluorides. Alternatively, perhaps Y is in a higher oxidation state.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 produces F2. So A1 must contain F in a lower oxidation state, which upon decomposition releases F2 (which is in 0 oxidation state). Wait, but that can't be right because F is usually in -1 in compounds. Oh, wait, F2 is elemental fluorine, so oxidation state 0.

So, perhaps A1 is a compound where F is in a lower oxidation state than in F2. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because F is -1 in compounds and 0 in F2. So, decomposition of A1 would produce F2, which implies that F in A1 is being oxidized to F2 (0), so A1 must have F in a lower oxidation state, which would require F to be in a negative state, which isn't possible. Wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. If A1 is a compound where F is in a higher oxidation state than in F2, but that can't be because F in compounds is -1, and in F2 it's 0. So perhaps A1 is a compound where F is in a lower oxidation state than in F2. Wait, but that's impossible because F can't be lower than -1 in compounds. So maybe the decomposition of A1 is not about fluorine's oxidation state but perhaps it's a decomposition that releases F2 gas, meaning that F is being reduced.

Wait, maybe A1 is a compound where Y is in a lower oxidation state, and upon decomposition, Y gets oxidized, releasing F2. So, perhaps A1 is YF, but when it decomposes, Y is oxidized, and F is reduced. Wait, that might make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the fluorination. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y in a 1:1 ratio, so it's YF. So Y is in +1 oxidation state.

So Y is a Group 1 element, such as Li, Na, K, etc. Let's take Y as sodium (Na), atomic weight ~23.

So, A3 is NaF.

Now, looking at the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. If Y is Na, then A1 would be NaF_x. Let's say A1 is NaF3. Upon decomposition, it might produce NaF and F2.

Wait, but when you decompose NaF3, what happens? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is NaF5. Decomposing into NaF and F2.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is something like:

NaF3 → NaF + F2↑.

Let me compute the fluorine percentage for A2.

If A2 is NaF, then its molecular weight is 23 +19=42.

Fluorine percentage: (19)/(42)*100 ≈45.24%, which is higher than 31.96%. So that doesn't match.

Alternatively, if A1 is NaF5, then upon decomposition, perhaps it breaks down into NaF3 and F2.

Wait, but without knowing the exact reaction, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is NaF3, which decomposes into NaF and F2.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the fluorination. Y is fluorinated in a 1:1 ratio to form A3. So, Y (metal) + F2 → YF.

If Y is Na, then A3 is NaF. But NaF is soluble in water. Hmm.

Another point: when Y is added to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A5 is a precipitate or an insoluble salt.

Wait, maybe A4 is a solution of a fluoride of Y, and when Y is added, it displaces another fluoride. For example, if A4 is YF3, and Y is added, perhaps it reacts to form YF and F2 gas. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF2. Adding Y metal would reduce it to YF.

Wait, but let's think about the given that A5 decomposes in water. So maybe A5 is a hydroxide or something that breaks down into an oxide and hydroxide.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a binary compound that breaks down into Y and another fluoride, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Let me try to summarize what I know so far:

- Y is an element that forms five binary fluorides. So Y must have multiple oxidation states with F.

- A1 decomposes into A2 (which has 31.96% F by weight) and F2.

- A3 is YF, formed by fluorinating Y in 1:1 ratio.

- Adding Y to A4 (hot, concentrated) gives A5, which decomposes into two substances in water.

Wait, perhaps Y is aluminum. Because aluminum can form AlF3, AlF4^- (in solution), etc. But when you add aluminum metal to a solution, perhaps it doesn't react unless it's a strong oxidizing solution.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is lead, which forms PbF2, PbF3, PbF4. Five binary compounds? Let's see: PbF2, PbF3, PbF4, and maybe others like PbF5 and PbF6? I'm not sure if all those are possible, but for the sake of the problem, let's assume Y has five binary fluorides.

Wait, but with Y as lead, let's compute the fluorine percentage in A2. If A2 is PbF2, then molecular weight is 207.2 + 38=245.2. F% is (38/245.2)*100≈15.5%, which is less than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

If A2 is PbF4, molecular weight is 207.2 +76=283.2. F% is (76/283.2)*100≈26.85%, still less than 31.96%. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps A2 is YF3. Let's compute Y's atomic weight again.

For YF3, F% is 31.96%:

3*19 / (Y + 57) = 0.3196 → (57)/(Y+57) =0.3196 → Y+57=57/0.3196 ≈178.3 → Y≈121.3.

Hmm, 121.3 is close to tin (Sn, ~118.71) or maybe something else.

Wait, Sn has an atomic weight of about 118.71, so let's test that.

If Y is Sn, then A2 is SnF3.

Molecular weight of SnF3: 118.71 +3*19=118.71+57=175.71 g/mol.

F% is (57/175.71)*100≈32.43%, which is close to 31.96%. So that's a possibility.

So, Y is tin (Sn), atomic weight ~118.71.

So, A1 is a binary compound of Sn and F. It decomposes into A2 (SnF3) and F2.

What would A1 be then? Let's think about possible Sn fluorides.

Sn forms SnF2, SnF4. Maybe SnF3 is formed under certain conditions.

If A1 is SnF4, upon decomposition, it might form SnF3 and F2.

Wait, let's write a possible reaction:

SnF4 → SnF3 + F2.

But let's balance the equation.

SnF4 → SnF3 + F2.

Left side: 1 Sn, 4 F.

Right side: 1 Sn, 3 F + 2 F2 → 1 Sn, 3 F + 4 F → 1 Sn,7 F.

Wait, that doesn't balance. Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is 2 SnF4 → 2 SnF3 + F2.

Let's check:

Left: 2 Sn, 8 F.

Right: 2 Sn, 6 F (from 2 SnF3) + 2 F (from F2) → 2 Sn, 8 F. Yes, that balances.

So, the reaction is 2 SnF4 → 2 SnF3 + F2 ↑.

So A1 is SnF4, which upon decomposition gives A2 (SnF3) and F2.

So, now A2 is SnF3, which has a F% of about 32.43%, which is close to the given 31.96%. Close enough for the problem.

So, Y is tin (Sn).

Now, moving on. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y in a 1:1 ratio. So Y is Sn, so A3 is SnF.

Wait, SnF? Or perhaps SnF does not exist, but perhaps it's a different stoichiometry. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A3 is SnF2, but that would require 2 F per Sn, which wouldn't be 1:1 molar ratio. Wait, the problem states that A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y in a 1:1 molar ratio. So the formula would be YF, which for Y=Sn would be SnF.

Wait, but tin typically doesn't form SnF. It forms SnF2 and SnF4. So perhaps I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider another element.

Wait, but let's proceed. If Y is tin, then A3 is SnF. However, SnF is not a common compound. So perhaps I'm wrong about Y being tin.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Let's try Y as lead (Pb).

If Y is Pb, then A2 would be PbF3. Let's compute the F percentage.

PbF3: Pb (207.2) +3*19=207.2+57=264.2.

F%: (57/264.2)*100≈21.6%, which is below 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Y is antimony (Sb, ~121.76). Let's compute for A2 as SbF3.

SbF3: 121.76 +57=178.76.

F%: (57/178.76)*100≈31.86%, which is very close to 31.96%. Perfect!

So Y is antimony (Sb), atomic weight ~121.76.

So A2 is SbF3.

Then, A1 would be a higher fluoride of Sb, perhaps SbF5, which decomposes into SbF3 and F2.

Let me write the decomposition reaction:

2 SbF5 → 2 SbF3 + F2 ↑.

Check the balance:

Left: 2 Sb, 10 F.

Right: 2 Sb, 6 F (from 2 SbF3) + 2 F (from F2) → 2 Sb, 8 F. Wait, that's not balanced. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

3 SbF5 → 2 SbF3 + 5 F2.

Let's check:

Left: 3 Sb, 15 F.

Right: 2 Sb, 6 F (from 2 SbF3) + 10 F (from 5 F2) → 2 Sb, 16 F. Not balanced.

Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let's consider the oxidation states.

In SbF3, Sb is in +3 oxidation state. In SbF5, Sb is +5.

Upon decomposition, SbF5 → SbF3 + F2.

So, Sb is being reduced from +5 to +3, and F is being oxidized from -1 to 0.

But wait, F is going from -1 to 0, which is oxidation. So F is losing electrons, which means it's the oxidizing agent.

Wait, but in the decomposition, SbF5 is both oxidizing and reducing? Or perhaps it's acting as a reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

2 SbF5 → 2 SbF3 + F2.

Let's balance the atoms:

Sb: 2 on both sides.

F: 10 on left, on right we have 6 (from 2 SbF3) + 2 (from F2) =8. Not balanced.

Hmm. Maybe the balanced equation is:

5 SbF5 → 5 SbF3 + 5 F2.

Wait, 5 SbF5 →5 SbF3 +5 F2.

Left:5 Sb, 25 F.

Right:5 Sb, 15 F (from SbF3) +10 F (from F2)=25 F. Yes, that balances.

So, the reaction is:

5 SbF5 →5 SbF3 +5 F2.

So A1 is SbF5, which upon decomposition gives A2 (SbF3) and F2.

Now, moving on. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Sb) in a 1:1 ratio. So that would be SbF. But Sb typically doesn't form SbF. It forms SbF3, SbF5, etc. So perhaps this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the molar ratio is 1:1, but the formula is SbF3, which would be a 1:3 ratio. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe the fluorination is adding one F per atom of Sb. So Sb + F2 → SbF.

But I don't think SbF is a known compound. So perhaps I'm wrong about Y being Sb.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of Y as something else. Let's try Y as arsenic (As, ~74.92).

If A2 is AsF3, then:

AsF3: 74.92 +57=131.92 g/mol.

F%: 57/131.92 *100≈43.24%, which is higher than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps Y is germanium (Ge, ~72.63). Let's see what happens.

If A2 is GeF3, then:

GeF3: 72.63 +57=129.63.

F%:57/129.63 *100≈44.0%, which is higher than 31.96. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is tellurium (Te, ~127.6). Let's compute for A2 as TeF3.

TeF3: 127.6 +57=184.6.

F%:57/184.6 *100≈30.9%, which is just below 31.96%. Close, but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A2 is TeF3, which has 30.9% F. The problem states 31.96%, which is close but not exact. Perhaps the problem uses rounded numbers, so it's possible.

So Y is Te.

So, A2 is TeF3, which decomposes from TeF5.

Wait, TeF5 decomposes into TeF3 and F2.

So the reaction would be:

TeF5 → TeF3 + F2.

Balancing:

Te: 1 each.

F:5 on left, 3 +2*2=7 on right. Hmm, not balanced.

Wait, perhaps 2 TeF5 → 2 TeF3 + F2.

Left: 2 Te, 10 F.

Right: 2 Te, 6 + 2 =8 F. Not balanced.

Alternatively, 3 TeF5 → 3 TeF3 + 5 F2.

Left:3 Te,15 F.

Right:3 Te, 9 F +10 F=19 F. Not balanced.

Hmm, maybe it's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition of A1 (TeF5) produces Te and F2.

TeF5 → Te + 5/2 F2. But that doesn't make sense in terms of oxidation states.

Alternatively, perhaps the decomposition is:

TeF5 → TeF4 + F2.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let me take a step back.

The problem is about determining the molecular weight of A4. So, perhaps I can find A4's formula and compute its molecular weight.

From the problem: adding Y in 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. A5 decomposes into two substances in water.

If Y is a metal, perhaps adding it to A4's solution causes a displacement reaction. For example, if A4 is a higher fluoride of Y, adding Y metal would reduce it to a lower fluoride.

Wait, let's say A4 is YF3. Adding Y metal would reduce it to YF.

So, reaction: Y (metal) + YF3 → 2 YF.

But then, what about the stoichiometry?

Alternatively, perhaps:

2 Y (metal) + 3 YF3 → 5 YF.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, if A4 is YF3, and Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio, perhaps it would produce YF and F2.

So, reaction: Y + YF3 → 2 YF + ½ F2.

But balancing:

Left: Y + YF3 → 2 Y atoms, 3 F.

Right: 2 YF (2 Y, 2 F) + ½ F2 (2 F).

Total F on left:3.

On right:2 F (from 2 YF) + 2 F (from F2) =4 F.

So, not balanced.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

3 Y + 2 YF3 → 5 YF + 3 F2.

Let's check:

Left:3 Y +2 YF3 →5 Y, 6 F.

Right:5 YF →5 Y,5 F; 3 F2 →6 F. Total F:5+6=11 F? No, that doesn't match.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Another thought: perhaps A4 is YF5, and when Y is added, it produces YF3 and F2.

Wait, maybe:

YF5 + Y → YF3 + F2.

But let's balance:

Left: 1 YF5 + 1 Y → 2 Y, 5 F.

Right:1 YF3 (1 Y,3 F) +1 F2 (2 F).

Total F on right:3+2=5 F.

Y: 1 on left (from YF5) +1 (from Y) →2 Y.

On right:1 Y (from YF3). So Y isn't balanced.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

2 YF5 + Y → 2 YF3 + 5 F2.

Check:

Left: 2 YF5 →2 Y,10 F; plus Y →3 Y,10 F.

Right:2 YF3 →2 Y,6 F; 5 F2 →10 F.

So Y:3 on left, 2 on right. Not balanced.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the final part. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, perhaps A5 is a salt that breaks down into two hydroxides or something.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a double fluoride. Or maybe it's a hydroxide.

Alternatively, maybe A5 is a fluoride that reacts with water to produce Y and another fluoride. For example, perhaps A5 is YF, which when in water, doesn't decompose, but if it's something more complex...

Wait, perhaps A5 is YF3·nH2O, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a diatomic fluoride, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should focus on what the question is asking: the molecular weight of A4.

From the options, the possible ranges are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

Now, let's think about possible compounds A4.

If A4 is YF3, and Y is around 120 (like Te), then YF3's molecular weight would be 120 +57=177. So that's in range C (160-180).

Alternatively, if Y is Sn (118.71), then SnF3 is 118.71+57=175.71. Again, in range C.

If Y is Ge (72.63), then GeF3 is 72.63+57=129.63, which is in D (110-130).

But earlier calculations suggested that A2 is YF3 with about 31.96% F, which fits Y being around 120 (like Te) or 118 (Sn).

So, if A4 is YF3, its molecular weight would be around 175-177 (for Sn or Te), which is in C (160-180). Alternatively, if Y is Ge, then A4's weight would be 129, which is in D (110-130). But earlier, the decomposition of A1 into A2 suggests Y has an atomic weight around 120, so A4 would be in C.

So, the answer would be option C: 160-180.


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of fluorine with element Y. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Key Information and Initial Observations**:
   - Five binary compounds of fluorine with Y are known.
   - A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by weight) and fluorine gas (F₂).
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y in a 1:1 molar ratio, suggesting A3 is YF.
   - Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 produces A5, which decomposes into two substances in water.

2. **Identifying Y**:
   - A2 has 31.96% fluorine by weight. For a compound YF₃, the molecular weight is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of YF₃} = Y + 57
     \]
     The fluorine percentage is:
     \[
     \frac{57}{Y + 57} \times 100 = 31.96
     \]
     Solving for \( Y \), the atomic weight of Y is approximately 121.3. This aligns closely with antimony (Sb, atomic weight ~121.76) or tin (Sn, atomic weight ~118.71).

3. **Determining A1 and A2**:
   - If Y is Sb, A1 could be SbF₅, which decomposes into SbF₃ and F₂:
     \[
     5 \, \text{SbF₅} \rightarrow 5 \, \text{SbF₃} + 5 \, \text{F₂}
     \]
     This satisfies the decomposition condition and the fluorine percentage in A2 (SbF₃).

4. **Analyzing A4**:
   - A4 is a binary compound of Y and fluorine. If A4 is YF₃, its molecular weight is:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of YF₃} = Y + 57
     \]
     For \( Y \approx 121.3 \), the molecular weight of A4 is approximately 178.3. This falls within the range 160–180.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the molecular weight of A4 is in the range 160–180.
