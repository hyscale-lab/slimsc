Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. Each partial wave contributes a term involving the Legendre polynomial and the corresponding phase shift. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) sinθ dδ_l/dθ, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, wait, the actual expression for the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ)

But wait, I think the imaginary part comes from certain terms here. Alternatively, when considering the optical theorem or perhaps the partial wave expansion, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) is given by a particular sum involving the phase shifts.

Wait, the forward direction is when the angle θ is 0 degrees, so cosθ is 1. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So, for θ=0, the expression simplifies.

So the scattering amplitude f(0) would be (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] * 1 * 1. Because sinθ is zero, but wait, in the general formula I think it's:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) (sinδ_l) P_l(cosθ) [ e^{iδ_l} ]

Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula. Oh right, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ)
