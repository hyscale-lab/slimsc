Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states can be represented as vectors on the Bloch sphere, but mixed states are points inside the Bloch sphere. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I think this looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The maximally mixed state is like an equal probability of being in state |0> or |1>, but without any coherence.

Wait, what's the Bloch vector representation of a density matrix? Oh right, any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components (x,y,z). The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. 

So let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So the equation is:

ρ = (I/2) + (r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2

Comparing this with the given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute |0><0| and |1><1|. 

|0> is the vector [1, 0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1> is [0,1], so |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]] which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, so substituting into the Bloch form: (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 is I/2.

If r·σ is zero, then all components of r must be zero. Because σx, σy, σz are the Pauli matrices, and for their linear combination to be zero, each coefficient (the components of r) must be zero. So r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. 

So the Bloch vector is at the origin. That would correspond to the point (0,0,0), which is option C. 

Wait, but wait a second. The maximally mixed state has zero Bloch vector because it's completely mixed, no preference in any direction. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, which has equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) but no coherence. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch vector representation of a single-qubit density matrix. The general form of a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector \((r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

This implies that the term \(r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z\) must be zero. For this to hold, all components of the Bloch vector \((r_x, r_y, r_z)\) must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is at the origin, corresponding to the point \((0, 0, 0)\).

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:
