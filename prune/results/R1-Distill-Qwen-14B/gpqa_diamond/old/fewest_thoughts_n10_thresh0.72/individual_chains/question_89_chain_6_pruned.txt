Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think this through.

So the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. The structure has four bridgehead carbons, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of those bridgehead positions.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. I think when vicinal dihalides (where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. Wait, but in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Are those adjacent? Let me think. The adamantane structure is such that each bridgehead is connected to three other bridgeheads. So positions 1 and 3 are across from each other on the diamond structure. So their distance is probably more than adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here.

Wait, wait, maybe it's not a vicinal dihalide then. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane. So considering the structure, the elimination would occur if the base abstracts a β hydrogen, causing the Br to leave and form a double bond. But with both Brs on bridgehead carbons, would elimination be possible?

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. If the base abstracts a proton adjacent to a Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But if the two Brs are on non-adjacent carbons, elimination would form a diene? Or perhaps a bridge.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. For adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to three other bridgeheads. So in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on opposite sides? So when KOH is added, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination with adjacent Hs. But wait, each Br is on a bridgehead, so the adjacent carb
