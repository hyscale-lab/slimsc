Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. 

The problem says an electron is traveling at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are given as A to D, with various exponents of 10.

Hmm, I think the first step is to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, because the Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. Wait, no, more accurately, Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I can probably use Δx * Δp = ħ/2. Oh wait, but sometimes people use ħ instead of h/(2π), so I have to get that right.

I remember that ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. So, first, let me calculate Δp. 

The formula is Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Wait, because Δx * Δp = ħ/2 → Δp = ħ/(2Δx). 

So substituting the numbers: Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, nanometers to meters. 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters. So Δx = 1e-10 m.

So Δp = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) ). Let me compute that. 

Denominator is 2e-10. So 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24. 1.05/2 is approximately 0.525. So Δp ≈ 0.525e-24 kg·m/s. Wait, that's 5.25e-25 kg·m/s
