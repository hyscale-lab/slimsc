Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, I need to find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle and figure out the form of the power function. Let me think this through step by step.

Alright, the setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis. Since it's oscillating, it must radiate energy, and the problem is about the radiation properties in the far field, the radiation zone.

The question asks about the maximum power radiated and the fraction at a specific angle θ. The maximum power is given as A. I need to find what fraction of A is radiated when θ is 30 degrees. Also, the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle, depends on lambda and theta. The options give different fractions and different dependencies on lambda.

Wait, I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is a function of theta. The power radiated in different directions depends on the angle. For a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis, which is the x-y plane if the dipole is along z. So the intensity would depend on cos(theta) squared or something like that.

But wait, the question is about an oscillating charge distribution. So maybe it's a dipole? Or perhaps a higher multipole? But the problem says it's spheroidal, which makes me think it's an electric dipole or magnetic dipole scenario.

In the radiation zone, the electric and magnetic fields fall off as 1/r. The intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to the square of the field, so it would fall off as 1/r². But the question is about power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity multiplied by the area element. Wait, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity, which is P/(4π) times some directional component.

Wait no, intensity is power per unit area. Power per unit solid angle would be the same as the intensity because, for isotropic emission, the power is P = 4π I, so I = P/(4π). But for directional emission, the intensity varies with direction. So the function f(λ, θ) is I, the intensity.

Now, from antenna theory, I remember that
