Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's try to understand it step by step. Hmm, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector walls.

Wait, okay, so initially, the Lorentz factor γ is 20, and 1/3 reach the walls. We need to find the γ that makes it 2/3.

I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they travel before decaying. Because if they move faster (higher γ), they might live longer, giving them more time to reach the detector's walls.

Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, and the observed lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The observed lifetime τ is γ times the proper lifetime τ0. So τ = γ τ0.

The distance a particle travels before decaying is its speed multiplied by the time it lives. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, I can approximate the speed as the speed of light, c. So distance L = v * τ ≈ c * τ = c * γ τ0.

But wait, the maximum distance the particle can travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the wall, L must be equal to 30 meters.

Originally, when γ is 20, one third reach the wall. So maybe the average distance they travel is such that only a fraction reach the wall. Hmm, why wouldn't all of them reach? Because some decay before getting there.

So perhaps the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the ratio of the distance they can travel (L) to the detector's radius (R). So P = L/R.

Wait, but that can't be exactly right because the exact distribution depends on the decay process. Alternatively, maybe the number of particles that reach the wall depends on the exponential decay law. Like, the survival probability is e^(-t/τ), where t is the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall. If the time is longer than the mean lifetime, the probability drops.

Wait, let me think. The mean proper lifetime is τ0. The observed lifetime is γ τ0. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = R / (v). At ultra-relativistic speeds, v ≈ c, so t ≈ R/(c). So t is the time measured in the lab frame. But in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is γ τ0. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is P = e^(-t/(γ τ0)}? Or wait, no, because in the particle's frame, the lifetime is τ0, so the time experienced by the particle is t' = t / γ. The decay probability is given by P = e^(-t' / τ0) = e^{-t/(γ τ0)}.

But the particle will reach the wall only if
