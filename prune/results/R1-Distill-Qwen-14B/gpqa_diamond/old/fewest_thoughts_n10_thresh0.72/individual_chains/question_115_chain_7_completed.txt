Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about an electron and a positron annihilating into two photons. Hmm, I've studied a bit about particle physics before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between these two photons.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So higher gamma means the particle is moving closer to the speed of light.

So, the electron's gamma is 4, and the positron's gamma is 2. I need to figure out their momenta and maybe their energies before annihilation because energy and momentum must be conserved.

But wait, in annihilation, the electron and positron's rest mass energy will be converted into photons. But wait, the rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is about 0.511 MeV each. But since they're moving at relativistic speeds, their kinetic energy is much higher than their rest mass energy.

Wait, but when they annihilate, they produce two photons. The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. The momentum of the system must also be conserved, I think.

Wait, but the electron is moving left to right (assuming positive x-direction) and the positron is moving right to left (negative x-direction). Wait, no, wait the positron is moving from the right, which I think would be in the negative x-direction. Because it's moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so its velocity is to the left.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so its velocity is in the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction. So their velocities are oppositely directed.

Wait, but wait, wait. The problem says that the electron is moving from the left, so its velocity is to the right (positive x). The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left (negative x).

But when they collide, they annihilate. So their momenta must combine, and their energies must add.

So the first step is to compute the total energy and the total momentum of the system before annihilation.

Each particle's energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. For a relativistic particle, the total energy E is gamma * m c². So for the electron, E_e = gamma_e * m_e c², and for the positron, E_p = gamma_p * m_e c².

Wait, but the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So its momentum would be opposite in sign to the electron's momentum.

Wait, okay. Let me get this straight:

- Electron: moving to the right (positive x), gamma_e =4.

- Positron: moving to the left (negative x), gamma_p=2.

So, the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But since v_e is in positive x, p_e is positive.

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since v_p is negative (moving left), p_p is negative.

Wait, but wait, actually, in terms of direction, the positron's momentum is in the negative x-direction. So when we compute the total momentum, it's p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative). But since each uses their own gamma, let's compute their momentum magnitudes.

Wait, but momentum p is gamma m v. And since v is a vector, the direction of p depends on v's direction.

So, the electron's momentum is in positive x: p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e.

The positron's momentum is in negative x: p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p. Because v_p is negative, so p_p is negative.

But I can compute the magnitudes.

Wait, but wait, another approach: since both are moving along the same line, their momenta are along the same axis. So, perhaps it's easier to compute the magnitude and direction.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Electron: gamma =4, moving right.

Positron: gamma=2, moving left.

So, their momenta in opposite directions.

Wait, but the problem mentions that after collision, the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So their directions are both in the right, but one upward (positive y) and one downward (negative y). Hmm, that suggests the system's total momentum is along the x-axis, because the photons' y-components would cancel each other.

Wait, because if photons have opposite y-momentum, their sum would be zero. So the initial system must have total momentum along the x-axis, and the photons' total momentum must also be along the x-axis. So their y-components cancel, but x-components add.

Wait, so the initial system's momentum is along the x-axis, and the photons' momenta have to sum to that same x-component. But their y-components must cancel, which they do because one is up and the other down.

So, let's compute the total momentum before annihilation.

Let me compute the momenta:

For electron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

But since gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v = c * sqrt(1- (1/gamma^2)).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum in terms of gamma and the rest mass.

Because for a particle, p = gamma m v. And since v = c^2 / (gamma m c^2 * ( ... )) Wait, maybe a different approach.

Wait, another formula: p = gamma m_e v_e. Also, E = gamma m_e c².

So, E_e = gamma_e m_e c².

Similarly, E_p = gamma_p m_e c².

But the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so p_p = - gamma_p m_e v_p.

But wait, if the positron is moving in the opposite direction, v_p is negative. So, p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p, but v_p is negative.

Alternatively, since their velocities are opposite, perhaps the momentum magnitudes can be computed as:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e,

p_p = gamma_p * m_e * |v_p|, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the signs. Let me think about their directions.

Electron: moving right (positive x-direction), so p_e is positive.

Positron: moving left (negative x-direction), so p_p is negative.

So, the total momentum P_total is p_e + p_p.

But I can compute each magnitude and then subtract.

Wait, but for that, I need to find the velocities in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the momenta.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum in terms of gamma and the rest mass.

Since for a particle, p = gamma m v, and v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Wait, but let me compute the magnitude of the electron's momentum and the positron's momentum.

Electron:

gamma_e =4.

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2)) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (c * sqrt(15))/4 ≈ 0.968 c.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m_e * ( (sqrt(15)/4) c ) = m_e c * sqrt(15).

Wait, because 4 times (sqrt(15)/4) is sqrt(15).

So, p_e = m_e c * sqrt(15).

Positron:

gamma_p =2.

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_p^2)) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (c * sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 0.866 c.

But since it's moving to the left, its momentum is negative.

p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * ( (sqrt(3)/2) c ) = m_e c * sqrt(3).

But since it's moving left, p_p = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So total momentum P_total = p_e + p_p = m_e c sqrt(15) - m_e c sqrt(3) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but wait, why is the positron's velocity to the left? So its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So, the momentum contributions are:

Electron: +m_e c sqrt(15).

Positron: - m_e c sqrt(3).

So P_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, but let me calculate the numerical values.

sqrt(15) ≈3.87298,

sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

So, P_total ≈ m_e c (3.87298 -1.73205) = m_e c (2.14093).

So, the total momentum is about 2.14093 m_e c in the positive x-direction.

Now, the energy of the system before annihilation is E_total = E_e + E_p.

E_e = gamma_e m_e c² =4 m_e c².

E_p = gamma_p m_e c² =2 m_e c².

So, E_total = (4 +2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

After annihilation, the system's energy is converted into two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy, so E_photon1 = E_photon2 = E_ph.

So, each photon has energy E =3 m_e c². Because 6 divided by 2 is 3.

So, each photon's energy is 3 m_e c².

Now, the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, meaning one is above the x-axis, the other below. So their y-components of momentum are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So, their y-components cancel each other, leaving the total momentum in the x-direction.

So, the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta.

Each photon's momentum has a magnitude p = E_ph /c. Because for photons, E = pc.

So, each photon has p_ph = E_ph /c = 3 m_e c² /c =3 m_e c.

So, each photon's momentum magnitude is 3 m_e c.

Now, let's denote the two photons as photon A and photon B.

Photon A is moving in upper-right direction, so its momentum components are (p_Ax, p_Ay).

Photon B is moving in lower-right direction, so its momentum components are (p_Bx, p_By), with p_By negative.

The total momentum after annihilation must equal the initial total momentum, which is P_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈2.14093 m_e c.

So, the sum of the x-components of the photons' momenta should equal P_total.

So, p_Ax + p_Bx = P_total.

And the sum of the y-components should be zero, because the initial system's momentum is all along x.

So, p_Ay + p_By =0.

Which implies p_Ay = -p_By.

So, the y-components cancel.

Now, each photon's momentum has magnitude 3 m_e c.

Let me represent the photons as vectors.

Photon A: magnitude 3 m_e c, direction upper-right, so polar angle theta above x-axis.

Photon B: magnitude 3 m_e c, direction lower-right, so polar angle phi below x-axis.

The x-components are p_Ax = 3 m_e c cos(theta), p_Bx =3 m_e c cos(phi).

The y-components are p_Ay=3 m_e c sin(theta), p_By=3 m_e c sin(phi), but since it's downward, phi is negative? Or in magnitude, sin(phi) would be positive, but direction negative.

Wait, perhaps it's better to take phi as the angle below the x-axis, so p_By = -3 m_e c sin(phi).

Wait, but regardless, the sum must be zero: p_Ay + p_By =0.

So, 3 m_e c sin(theta) + (-3 m_e c sin(phi)) )=0.

Which implies sin(theta) = sin(phi).

So, theta = phi or theta= 180-phi.

But I think in this case, theta and phi are the same because the photons are symmetric above and below the x-axis. So, the angles are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, but let me think about their directions. If the upper photon is at angle theta above the x-axis, the lower is theta below. So, their y-components are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

So, sin(theta) = sin(phi), and p_Ay = - p_By.

So, yes, that's correct.

So, we can model the sum of x-components:

p_Ax + p_Bx =3 m_e c [cos(theta) + cos(theta)] since phi is same as theta in magnitude.

Wait, no, wait: if the lower photon is at angle phi below x, then p_Bx is 3 m_e c cos(phi), but phi is positive if measured from the x-axis downward. Wait, but cos is even function, so cos(theta) = cos(-theta) = cos(phi). So in that case, cos(phi) is same as cos(theta).

Wait, but that depends on how we define phi. Let me clarify.

Let me define theta as the angle above the x-axis for photon A. Then, photon B has an angle of (180 - theta) below the x-axis, but wait no, wait. Alternatively, photon B's angle is theta' below the x-axis, so its polar angle is (pi - theta) in the opposite direction. Wait, no, because the angle is measured clockwise.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this in terms of unit vectors.

So, photon A makes angle theta with the positive x-axis (upper right), and photon B makes angle (360 - theta) if it's in the lower right, but perhaps it's better to model their angles as theta and (360 - theta), but in terms of calculations, perhaps it's easier to model theta and (pi + theta) in radians, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, so their angles with the x-axis are theta and -theta.

Wait, no, because upper-right and lower-right would have angles theta and phi, but in the case of lower-right, the angle is measured clockwise from x-axis. So, if I model the angle as theta above x-axis, then the other would be (360 - theta) degrees, but in terms of sin and cos, the cos would be cos(theta), and the sin would be -sin(theta).

Wait, perhaps I should model the angles as theta and -theta, where theta is the angle from the x-axis to photon A, and -theta is the angle for photon B. But that would mean photon B is at (360 - theta) degrees if we're talking in degrees, but in terms of direction, it's the same as angle theta below the x-axis.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that photon B is at angle (180 - theta) degrees in the lower half. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if photon A is at theta above x-axis, photon B is at theta below x-axis, but on the right side. So, their angles are theta and (360 - theta), but since they're both in the right half, perhaps it's better to think of their angles as theta and -theta relative to the x-axis.

Wait, but in that case, the sum of their y-components would be sin(theta) + sin(-theta) =0, which is correct.

So, the two photons have angles theta and -theta with respect to the x-axis.

So, their x-components are p_Ax =3 m_e c cos(theta), p_Bx=3 m_e c cos(-theta)=3 m_e c cos(theta).

Wait, no, because cos(-theta)=cos(theta). So, their x-components add up.

Wait, but that would sum to 6 m_e c cos(theta).

Wait, but the sum of their x-components must equal the initial total momentum P_total = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, 6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Dividing both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So,

cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.

Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: sqrt(15)≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205. So, 3.87298 -1.73205≈2.14093.

Denominator is 6.

So, cos(theta)=2.14093/6≈0.35682.

So, theta = arccos(0.35682) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, arccos(0.35682) is about 69 degrees? Let me think:

cos(60)=0.5,

cos(70)=approx 0.3420, which is lower than 0.3568.

So, 69 degrees: cos(69) is approx 0.3584, which is close to 0.3568.

So, theta≈69 degrees.

So, each photon is at about 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.

Wait, but then the angle between the two photons is the sum of their angles from the x-axis. Since one is at +69 and the other at -69, the angle between them is 69 +69=138 degrees.

But wait, that's the angle between them. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Compute cos(theta):

sqrt(15) ≈3.872983346,

sqrt(3)≈1.732050808.

So, sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)=3.872983346-1.732050808=2.140932538.

Divide by 6: 2.140932538/6≈0.3568220897.

So, cos(theta)=0.3568220897.

Now, arccos(0.3568220897) is about 69 degrees.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, arccos(0.356822):

Well, 0.356822 is between 0.3420 (cos(70)) and 0.5 (cos 60).

So, using a calculator, cos(69 degrees)= approximately 0.3584.

Which is a bit higher than 0.3568.

So, theta is slightly more than 69 degrees. Let's say approximately 69 degrees.

Wait, but for more precision, perhaps using a calculator:

Let me compute cos(69.0) = approx 0.3584.

cos(69.5) is around 0.3515.

Wait, 0.3568 is between 0.3584 and 0.3515, so theta is between 69 and 69.5 degrees.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a sign or a factor.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup earlier.

Because, when I set up the equation:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Wait, let me re-examine that.

Earlier, I set the sum of the x-components of the photons as:

p_Ax + p_Bx = 3 m_e c cos(theta) +3 m_e c cos(theta) =6 m_e c cos(theta).

Because both photons have the same angle theta above and below the x-axis.

Wait, but wait, no. Because one photon is at theta above, the other at theta below.

Wait, but wait, no.

Wait, each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c.

Photon A: at theta above x-axis.

Photon B: at theta below x-axis.

So, the x-components would be 3 m_e c cos(theta) for each.

So, sum is 6 m_e c cos(theta) = P_total.

But earlier, the P_total was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, 6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Yes, that's correct.

So, cos(theta)= [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)]/(6).

Which is approximately 0.3568.

So, theta≈69 degrees.

But then the angle between the two photons is 2 theta =138 degrees, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, the photons are moving in opposite directions in the y-component, but same direction in x-component. So their angle between them is 180 - 2 theta? No, that's when they are symmetric w.r. to x-axis.

Wait, no. Imagine two photons moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. The angle between them is the sum of their angles from the x-axis.

Wait, no. Let me think of photon A at +theta above x-axis, photon B at -theta below x-axis.

So, the angle between them would be theta + theta = 2 theta.

But that would be if they're both in the same half. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the angle between photon A and photon B is 180 - 2 theta.

Wait, no. Let me think of the angle each makes with the x-axis. Photon A is at theta above x, photon B is at theta below x. So, the angle between them is theta + theta = 2 theta.

But wait, 2 theta is 138 degrees if theta is 69 degrees.

Yes, so the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.

Wait, but another way: the angle from photon A to photon B is 180 -2 theta, but no, because photon B is on the same side of the x-axis as photon A, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of vectors.

Photon A: direction (cos(theta), sin(theta)).

Photon B: direction (cos(theta), -sin(theta)).

The angle between these two vectors would be the angle between (cos(theta), sin(theta)) and (cos(theta), -sin(theta)).

So, the dot product is cos(theta)*cos(theta) + sin(theta)*(-sin(theta)) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).

So, the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, because the dot product formula is:

u · v = |u||v| cos(phi), where phi is the angle between them.

Since |u| and |v| are both 1 (unit vectors), then:

cos(phi)= u · v = cos(2 theta).

So phi = 2 theta.

Wait, because cos(phi)=cos(2 theta) implies phi =2 theta or phi= -2 theta, but since angles are between 0 and 180, phi=2 theta.

So, if theta is about 69 degrees, then phi is 138 degrees.

Which is option C.

So the correct answer is C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, which produce two photons with equal energy. The photons move in upper-right and lower-right directions, and we are tasked with finding the angle between them.

### Step 1: Conservation of Energy and Momentum
- The electron and positron have Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. Their total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies:
  \[
  E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2)m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2.
  \]
  After annihilation, this energy is converted into two photons of equal energy:
  \[
  E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3m_e c^2.
  \]

- The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Using the relativistic momentum formula \(p = \gamma m v\) and \(v = c \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2}\), the magnitudes of their momenta are:
  \[
  p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = m_e c \sqrt{15},
  \]
  \[
  p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = m_e c \sqrt{3}.
  \]
  Since the positron moves left (negative \(x\)-direction) and the electron moves right (positive \(x\)-direction), the total momentum is:
  \[
  P_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
  \]

### Step 2: Momentum of the Photons
- After annihilation, the photons have equal energy \(E_{\text{photon}} = 3m_e c^2\), and their momentum magnitudes are:
  \[
  p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3m_e c^2}{c} = 3m_e c.
  \]
- Let the photons make angles \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) with the \(x\)-axis (upper-right and lower-right directions, respectively). Their \(x\)-components of momentum are:
  \[
  p_{A_x} = 3m_e c \cos\theta, \quad p_{B_x} = 3m_e c \cos\theta.
  \]
  The total \(x\)-momentum of the photons must equal the initial total momentum:
  \[
  p_{A_x} + p_{B_x} = 6m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
  \]
  Dividing through by \(m_e c\):
  \[
  6\cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
  \]

### Step 3: Solve for \(\theta\)
- Compute \(\sqrt{15} \approx 3.873\) and \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\):
  \[
  \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 3.873 - 1.732 = 2.141.
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \cos\theta = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.357.
  \]
  Using \(\arccos(0.357)\), we find:
  \[
  \theta \approx 69^\circ.
  \]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
- The photons are symmetric about the \(x\)-axis, with angles \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\). The angle between them is:
  \[
  \phi = 2\theta = 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
  \]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
