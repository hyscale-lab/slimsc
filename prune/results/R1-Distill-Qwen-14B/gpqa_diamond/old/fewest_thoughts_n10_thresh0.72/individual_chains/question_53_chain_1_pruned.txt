Okay, so I need to figure out the chemical formula of this di-substituted aromatic compound. Let's see, the compound is a six-membered aromatic ring, which probably means it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, so the molecule must have an ester functional group. Ester groups are typically R-O-C-O-R, so that would introduce some oxygen into the structure.

Looking at the NMR data: there are six signals in total. Two are aromatic Hs, two are vinyl Hs, and two are for -CH3 groups. No signals for -CH2 groups, so the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups. Hmm, so what's the structure that fits all this?

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so there are two groups attached. But each group might add more substituents. For the aromatic Hs, if the ring is di-substituted, the aromatic protons could be in a para, meta, or ortho arrangement. But the NMR shows two signals for aromatic Hs, which suggests that there are two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Maybe each substituent is causing a certain symmetry.

In a para-substituted benzene, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent Hs (ortho and para positions relative to substituents). But wait, if each substituent is a group that creates symmetry, maybe each substituent is a substituent group that is itself symmetric. Or perhaps the substituents are the same, so the ring has symmetry.

The presence of vinyl Hs suggests that there are double bonds, probably in substituents attached to the ring. The vinyl Hs are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets implies that a proton is coupling with two sets of neighboring protons. Maybe an allylic system, like in an ester group where there's a vinyl group attached to the oxygen.

Wait, ester groups are R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R. So maybe the substituents on the benzene are ester groups. But each ester group would have an oxygen, so two substituents would add two oxygen atoms. But the molecular formula options all have O2, so that fits.

But wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, so that's two oxygen atoms per ester. So the di-substituted benzene would have two ester groups? Or maybe one ester and another substituent? Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and another is something else.

Wait, but the FTIR shows an ester group, so only one ester is present. So perhaps the substituents are an ester group and another group. Maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is, say, a methyl group or another type.

Looking at the NMR: the two signals for -CH3 groups. So maybe there are two methyl groups somewhere. Ester groups can have R groups attached. For example, if one substituent is an ester like O-CO-OCH2CH3, but that's maybe a longer chain. Wait, or perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester, like O-CO-OCH3. But that would have
