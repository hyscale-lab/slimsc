Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the question is about binary star systems and figuring out which one is more massive. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses.

Then, from spectroscopic observations, we get the radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the velocities have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. They consider the mass as the sum of both stars' masses.

Hmm, I remember that in binary stars, the more massive star would orbit more slowly, but I'm not entirely sure. Also, the radial velocity method is about the Doppler shift as the stars move towards and away from us. The amplitude of this velocity is related to the mass of the companion. 

Wait, I think the key here is to remember Kepler's laws, especially for binary systems. The mass function might come into play here. Oh right, the mass function relates the observed velocities to the masses of the stars.

Alternatively, I think the formula involves the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. Let me try to recall the formula.

The mass function for each star in a binary system is given by (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), where i is the inclination angle (which is 90 degrees for an eclipsing binary, so sin i is 1). But wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocities and the masses.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit. The velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses. So, if one star is more massive, its velocity is smaller. 

So, for a binary system, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to (M2/M1), since M1 v1 = M2 v2. So, K1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * (2Ï€ a sin i) / P, but maybe that's getting too detailed.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So, if K1 and K2 are the velocity amplitudes of the two stars, then K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So in system_1, K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s. So K1/K2 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2. So M1 is half of M2. Wait, no, wait. Wait: K1/K2 = M2/M1. So, K1=10, K2=5. So K1/K2=2. So M2/M1 = 2. So M2 is twice M1. That would make
