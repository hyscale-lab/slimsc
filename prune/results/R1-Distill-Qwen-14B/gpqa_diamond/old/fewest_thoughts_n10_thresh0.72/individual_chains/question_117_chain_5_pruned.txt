Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, specifically when a compound has chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. If a compound has one or more chiral centers, it can exhibit optical activity, meaning it can rotate plane-polarized light.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected at position 1. So the structure has two benzene rings connected via a single bond. The substituents are nitro groups on the 6 positions and carboxylate groups on the 2 positions of each ring. Since it's a biphenyl, the possibility of stereochemistry comes from the arrangement around the central bond. Are the substituents in positions that create a chiral environment?

Wait, the central bond is a single bond between the two benzene rings. So the two rings can rotate relative to each other. If the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, then it would have stereoisomerism. But wait, if the substituents are symmetrical, perhaps not. Let's think: the positions are 6,6' and 2,2'. The numbering in biphenyl is such that the first ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, and the other ring also at 2' and 6'. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule symmetric, then maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are not symmetric, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the two rings are in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that each ring has two substituents on opposite sides, making the entire molecule lack a plane of symmetry. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about the possibility of the molecule having a center of chirality. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, which would prevent it from being chiral.
