Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked the reaction progress using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning it's reacting, and two new spots appeared. So, the reaction must have produced two products.

I need to figure out which option correctly identifies these products. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about what kind of reaction this might be.

The starting material is an allyl ether attached to a benzene ring. The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, breaking that down, the butenyl group is at position 1 (since it's but-3-en-1-yl). That would make the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, right? Wait, no. Wait, butenyl has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, wait. The numbering might be different. Let me draw it mentally.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3? No, because butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would actually be CH2CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond starting at C3. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. The numbering can go two ways: 1 and 2, or 2 and 3. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no. Because but has four carbons. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, that would be beyond the four carb
