Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of this system. Let's read the question again.

Alright, so there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The system is isolated, so energy considerations are probably going to be about electric potential energy.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P. Hmm, but wait, are they arranged in some specific way, like on a sphere or something? The question doesn't specify, but since all are at the same distance from P, maybe they're equally spaced around a sphere of radius 2 meters. But for the purpose of calculating potential energy, maybe their exact arrangement doesn't matter because we're looking for the minimum energy.

Wait, the problem is about the minimum energy of the system. So I need to calculate the potential energy. Since the system is isolated, the total energy is the sum of the electric potential energies.

So the total potential energy will consider the interactions between each pair of charges. So each charge at point P (the 13th) and each of the 12 others. Plus, the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is at a fixed distance from P. So the 13th charge is fixed at P, and all 12 others are 2 m away. So the distance between the 13th and any of the 12 is 2 m. But what about the distance between the 12 charges? Oh, wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their mutual distances aren't given. Hmm, that complicates things because the potential energy between the 12 charges depends on their arrangement.

But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the configuration where the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Hmm, potential energy in a system of point charges is generally positive when the charges are all the same because they repel each
