Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, and a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's start by identifying each component.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with Y. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So W's molecule is something like H2O, NH3, CO2? Wait, same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think. For example, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 p and 0 n) and one O (8 p, 8 n). No, wait, the molecule as a whole? Or each atom?

Wait, the question says the molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So the total neutrons in the molecule equals the total protons. Let's think of possible gases. Maybe CO2? Let's calculate.

Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's the most common isotope, but isotopes vary). Oxygen has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (like O-16). So CO2: 1 C and 2 O.

Protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22.

Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh, wait, that's equal. So CO2 is a possibility for W. Or maybe H2O? H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So H2O: 2 H (2 p) and 1 O (8 p). So total p: 10; n: 2 H have 0 n, O has 8. So n=8. Not equal. So not H2O. What else? Maybe CH4? Let's see: C has 6 p, H has 1 each. So 6 +
