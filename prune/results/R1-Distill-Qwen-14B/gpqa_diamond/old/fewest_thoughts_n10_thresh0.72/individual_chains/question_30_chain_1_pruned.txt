Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I remember that when something absorbs light, it reflects or emits the complementary color. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when a compound absorbs a certain wavelength, it reflects the color that's opposite on the color wheel. Or is it that the color we see is the color not absorbed?

Wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. Oh, right, that's about the energy of the photon it's emitting. So I think that when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited, and then when it relaxes, it emits light. The energy of the emitted photon determines the color we see.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher, right? Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state to a higher one. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed light is higher than the emitted. Or is it the same?

Wait no, not necessarily. Because the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state is the same as the energy of the photon emitted. But when the molecule absorbs a photon, it's going from the ground state to an excited state, so the energy of the absorbed photon is the energy difference. So maybe the emitted photon is of the same energy? Or no, because the molecule might lose some energy through other means, but in this case, maybe it's a simple transition.

Wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3
