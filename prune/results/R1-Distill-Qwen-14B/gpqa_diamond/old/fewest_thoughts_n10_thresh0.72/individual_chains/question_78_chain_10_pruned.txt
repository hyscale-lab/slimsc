Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potentials in electrodynamics. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given a moving point charge q. The charge is moving along some trajectory s(t), and the observation time t is greater than the time tr when the field was generated. So, the field we're observing is retarded, I think.

From what I remember, when charges are moving, we need to consider retarded potentials because the electromagnetic fields take time to propagate. The potentials depend on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time. 

The scalar potential V is usually due to the charge itself, and the vector potential A is due to the motion of the charge. The formulas for these potentials involve the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time.

Wait, the general expressions for the potentials are something like this: 

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by (1/r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r.

Similarly, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v/(4π)) multiplied by (v/(c² r')), where v is the velocity of the charge at tr, and r' is the same distance as in V.

But wait, I think the exact forms involve some terms with the vector d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr (let's call that r') to the observation point r. So d = r - r', or something like that.

Wait, in the problem statement, d is the vector from the field generating point (r') to r. So d = r - r'.

The expressions for V and A would then involve terms like 1/(d c - d · v), because of the relative motion between the charge and the observer point. Oh right, I remember something about a Lorentz contraction or maybe just the form of the potential when the charge is moving.

Wait, the denominator in the potentials probably comes from the Lorentz factor because of the relative velocity. So it's something like (d c - v · d) in the denominator, where d is the vector from the charge's position to
