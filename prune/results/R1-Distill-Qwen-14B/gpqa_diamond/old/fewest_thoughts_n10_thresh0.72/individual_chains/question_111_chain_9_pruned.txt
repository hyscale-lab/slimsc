Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The problem has two parts: reactions A and B, and I need to choose the major products from the options provided. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I'm thinking this might be some kind of enolate formation followed by alkylation or maybe a conjugate addition. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Oh! So perhaps this is a Michael addition or a conjugate addition reaction.

Wait, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw this structure. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl). Wait, no. Wait, the numbering might be different. Let me make sure. The main chain is cyclohexanone, with a ketone at position 1. So position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl? Or maybe the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group attached. Position 6 also has a methyl group. So the cyclohexanone has substituents: at position 2, ethyl and methyl; at position 6, methyl. So the ring looks a bit crowded.

When t-BuOK is used, which is a strong, bulky base, it will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. But where? The enolate can form at the alpha positions, which are the positions adjacent to the carbonyl. So in cyclohexanone, the alpha carbons are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, but in this molecule, positions 2 and 6
