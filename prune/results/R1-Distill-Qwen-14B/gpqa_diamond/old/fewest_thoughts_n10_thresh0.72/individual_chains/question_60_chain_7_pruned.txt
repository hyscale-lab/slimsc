Okay, so I've got this problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I think I remember something about special relativity and how time slows down for objects moving at high speeds relative to an observer. Let me try to work through this.

Alright, the setup: There's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that travels at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 years. They want to send a 22-year-old astronaut to Earth. We need to find out how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, so the question is about the proper time experienced by the astronaut, right? Because from Earth's frame, the trip would take longer due to time dilation, but the astronaut's own clock would measure less time.

But wait, I need to clarify the frames of reference here. The astronaut is on the spacecraft moving at 0.99999987c. So, for the astronaut, the distance to Earth is contracted. Because length contraction occurs in the direction of motion. So, the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth would appear shorter from the astronaut's frame.

Wait, but how far is the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth? I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let's approximate it as, say, 170,000 light-years. But wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, the problem is asking about the astronaut's own experienced time, which is the proper time. So perhaps I don't need the actual distance because we can calculate using the Lorentz factor.

Wait another thought. The time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which is the shortest possible time between two events. So, in this scenario, the events are the astronaut leaving home and arriving at Earth. The proper time (tau) is given by the equation:

tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Wait, no, the equation is different. Let me think.
