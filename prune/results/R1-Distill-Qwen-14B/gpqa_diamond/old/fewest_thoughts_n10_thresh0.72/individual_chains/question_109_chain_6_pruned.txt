Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and there's this equation given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0, and I need to determine which partial wave isn't permitted. The options are given as A to D, each involving a transition from 1S0 to some state plus a particle.

Hmm, okay. So let me try to unpack this. The initial state is 1S0. Let me first figure out what that means in terms of quantum numbers. The general term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), right? So, 1S0: the 1S part indicates S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L is S, which is orbital angular momentum. Oh wait, no, wait. The S here is the spectroscopic notation. So S, P, D, F... correspond to L=0,1,2,3 respectively. So 1S0 would mean S=0 (so 2S+1=1), L=0 (since S is the label), and J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

So the initial state is a singlet state (S=0), with no orbital angular momentum (L=0), and total angular momentum J=0.

Now, the system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the process is NN â†’ NN' + X, but wait, actually, in the problem statement, it's more like the initial state is the bound system, and they emit X, so the final state is the new NN state plus X. Or perhaps it's a decay process? Not sure, but perhaps the parity considerations are more important.

Wait, the question says, "the final NN state has T(NN) =0." So the isospin of the NN pair is 0. Let's think about the isospin. For two nucleons, each has isospin 1/2. So when combining
