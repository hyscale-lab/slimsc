Okay, so I have this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I need to think through it step by step.

First, the given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a two-dimensional metric, maybe on some surface. I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, but here it's probably a two-dimensional space since it's just dx² and dy² terms.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere—oh right, that's a surface of constant negative curvature. Its geometry is different from a regular sphere. So, the area might not be the same as the regular sphere's 4πr².

Wait, the pseudosphere's area... I think the formula for the area of a pseudosphere (which is a tractricoid) is 4πr², same as a regular sphere? No, wait, no, that can't be right because the pseudosphere has infinite area. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, the tractricoid, which is the surface of a pseudosphere, actually has finite area. I remember something about that. Oh right, the surface area of a pseudosphere is 4πr². Or wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up with something else.

But wait, looking at the metric given—maybe it's related to hyperbolic space? Because the pseudosphere is a model in hyperbolic geometry. Let me see the metric
