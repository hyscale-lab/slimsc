Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me break this down and think through each step.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target compound. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering... Let me visualize this. Position 1 is ethoxy (OCH2CH3), position 2 is tert-butyl (C(CH2CH3)3?), and position 3 is nitro (NO2). So the substituents are at adjacent positions? Or are they meta? Wait, 1, 2, and 3 are consecutive positions on the benzene ring. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. That would make it a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

But wait, the substituents are ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the substituents are in adjacent positions. I think that's correct.

Now, the process of synthesizing this from benzene would involve a series of electrophilic substitution reactions. But the order of the reactions is crucial because substituents can direct the incoming groups to specific positions.

So let me think about directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para), and tert-butyl is a bulky group but since it's an alkyl group, it's an activating, ortho/para director.

Wait, but the order of adding these substituents will affect where each group goes. So the first substituent will determine the orientation of the next, etc.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's see their positions:

- Ethoxy (OCH2CH3) is at position 1.
- tert-Butyl is at position 2.
- Nitro is at position 3.

Wait, that's positions 1,2,3. So 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 2 and 3 are adjacent as well. So the ring is 1-OCH2CH3, 2-C(CH3)3, 3-NO2.

Wait, no, wait. I think the numbering might be different. Because in benzene, the numbering starts with the first substituent, then the next in the direction that gives the lowest numbers. So if substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

But let's think about the directing effects. Since nitro is a meta director, if it's added first, it would direct incoming groups to meta positions. But maybe we need to add the activating groups first to control where the deactivating groups go.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the bulky tert-butyl group first would help in directing the next substituents because of steric effects.

Wait, but let me approach this more methodically.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me consider which substituents are activating and which are deactivating. Nitro is deactivating (meta director), ethoxy is activating (ortho/para), and tert-butyl is activating (ortho/para, but bulky).

So, when adding substituents, activating groups direct the incoming electrophiles. Deactivating groups come later because the ring becomes less reactive, making them harder to add. So, perhaps it's best to add the activating groups first, then the deactivating.

Alternatively, sometimes people add the nitro group early if it's a better director, but since nitro is deactivating, it would make the ring less reactive towards further substitution. So maybe adding nitro last would be better.

Wait, but the order of adding the substituents will determine their positions. Let's consider that.

Suppose I add the ethoxy group first. Then, the next substituent could be the tert-butyl group. Then, the nitro group.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong meta director. So where will it go?

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group should be added in a position that's meta to another group.

Wait, let me consider the steps:

1. Benzene â†’ add ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). Let's say this is at position 1.

2. Next, add tert-butyl group. It's an activating group. Since the ring already has an activating group (ethoxy, which is at position 1), the tert-butyl will be added in one of the activated positions. Ethoxy directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions relative to itself. So the ethoxy is at position 1. The next substituent (tert-butyl) can be at position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). But since the target has it at 2, perhaps the second substituent is added in the ortho position.

But wait, after adding ethoxy, the next substituent will likely go para to it unless steric effects or other factors direct it ortho.

Wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so when adding the next substituent, the incoming group will enter ortho or para to the ethoxy group.

If I add the tert-butyl group next, it may go para to ethoxy (position 4) or ortho (position 2). But in the target, it's at position 2. So maybe the tert-butyl is added next, in the ortho position.

But wait, adding an activating group (tert-butyl) to a ring that already has an activating group (ethoxy) can lead to competition in directing. So the first substituent (ethoxy) is in position 1, and the next substituent (tert-butyl) could be in position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But the target has tert-butyl in position 2. So maybe the second step is adding tert-butyl in position 2.

Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. The next substituent is nitro. Nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. But where would it go?

Wait, the ring now has substituents at 1 and 2. The third substituent (nitro) will be added where? Let's consider the directing effects of the existing substituents.

The ethoxy group (activating) is at 1, and the tert-butyl (activating) is at 2. Since both are activating, they are ortho/para directors.

But when the ring has multiple substituents, the position of the incoming group is determined by the strongest director.

Wait, ethoxy is a stronger activating group than tert-butyl because it's an electron-donating group (OCH2CH3) compared to an alkyl group. Or is the tert-butyl bulky but also activating.

But maybe the nitro group is a deactivating group, which is introduced after the ring has two activating groups. But wait, nitro is being added last. So when adding nitro as the third substituent, the existing groups are ethoxy and tert-butyl.

But wait, the nitro group is a meta director. So where would it go? Let me imagine the ring with substituents at 1 and 2. The incoming nitro group (as an electrophile) will be directed by the existing substituents.

Ethoxy is at 1 (activating, ortho/para), tert-butyl at 2 (activating, ortho/para).

But the nitro group is a strong deactivating group. So the reaction for nitration would require a nitronium ion as the electrophile. The existing substituents (ethoxy and tert-butyl) are activating, making the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

The nitro group is a meta director, but it's being added after the other substituents. Wait, but when adding the nitro group, the substituents on the ring are ethoxy (activating) and tert-butyl (activating). So the nitro group will be directed by these.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the positions. The ring currently has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2.

Where can the nitro group go? Let's imagine the possible positions.

In a benzene ring with substituents at 1 and 2, the next substituent can be at 3, 4, 5, or 6, but it depends on the directing.

Wait, but when two substituents are present, the incoming group goes to the position that is activated by the majority of the substituents.

But in this case, ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2. Let's consider the possible positions for nitro.

If ethoxy (1) is an activating group, it directs incoming groups to ortho (2) and para (4). But position 2 is already occupied by tert-butyl. So the next available position would be para to ethoxy, which is position 4.

Alternatively, the tert-butyl at 2 is an activating group, directing to ortho (1 and 3) and para (5). Position 1 is already occupied by ethoxy, so positions 3 and 5 are available.

Wait, but the nitro group is a deactivating group, which is usually a meta director when added. But in this case, nitration is being done on a ring that's already activated by two substituents. Hmm.

Wait, but the nitro group is introduced as a substituent, so the existing substituents will direct it.

Wait, no. The nitro group is being added as the third substituent. The existing substituents are ethoxy and tert-butyl, which are activating and thus ortho/para directors.

So when adding the nitro group, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. The incoming nitro group (as an electrophile) will be directed by these groups.

Which substituent has a stronger directing effect? Ethoxy is a better activating group than tert-butyl. So the nitro group may be directed by the ethoxy group.

So ethoxy is at 1. The para position to ethoxy is 4. The ortho is 2, which is already occupied. So the nitro group would go to position 4? But in the target, the nitro is at position 3.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is meta to the tert-butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being directed by the tert-butyl group. The tert-butyl is at 2. Its para position is 5, and ortho positions are 1 and 3. Position 1 is already occupied, so the nitro could go to position 3.

Ah, that makes sense. So the tert-butyl group is directing the nitro to position 3 (ortho to itself). Because the tert-butyl is a stronger director in this case.

Wait, but why would the tert-butyl be a stronger director than the ethoxy group? Because it's a bulky group, so maybe the approach is more influenced by the tert-butyl.

Wait, but in terms of activating strength, ethoxy is a stronger activating group than tert-butyl. So ethoxy is more activating, so it might have a stronger influence on directing the nitro group.

Hmm, I'm stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reaction sequence instead.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

So the order of adding substituents would probably be:

1. Ethoxy group added first.

2. Then tert-butyl group added in the ortho position to ethoxy (position 2).

3. Then nitro group added in the meta position relative to the tert-butyl group, which is position 3.

Wait, but when adding the nitro group, the substituents are ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. So where would the nitro group go? How is it directed?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after ethoxy and tert-butyl are already present. So, considering the existing substituents, the nitro group would have to go to a position that is activated by both ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, but ethoxy directs to 2 and 4, and tert-butyl directs to 1,3,5. So the only overlapping position is position 3.

Ah, that makes sense. Because position 3 is ortho to the tert-butyl group at 2, and maybe also activated by the ethoxy group in some way. So the nitro group would enter position 3.

But wait, ethoxy is at 1. Position 3 is two carbons away from 1, which is meta to ethoxy. So ethoxy would direct the nitro group to its ortho (position 2, occupied) or para (position 4). But the nitro group ends up at 3, which is meta to ethoxy. That doesn't align with the directing effects.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps in the options.

Looking at the options, each has a series of reactions. The options are A, B, C, D. Each option lists a series of reactions from i to ix.

I need to see which sequence of reactions would lead to the target.

But perhaps the key is that the nitro group is a strong meta director, so when it's added, it must be added in a position that is meta to an existing substituent. Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added last.

Wait, the target has three substituents. Let's think about which is easier to add first. Maybe the tert-butyl group is added first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl? No, because nitro is deactivating, making the ring less reactive for subsequent reactions.

Wait, but maybe the order is ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Let's see.

If the first substituent is ethoxy, then the next is tert-butyl. Since ethoxy is at 1, the tert-butyl could go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). Then, the nitro group would go where?

Wait, if the substituents are at 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (tert-butyl), then adding nitro would have to be in a position directed by these. Let me see:

The nitro group is an electrophile; the existing substituents are activating, so they are ortho/para directors.

The ethoxy group at 1 directs to 2 (ortho, occupied) and 4 (para). The tert-butyl at 2 directs to 1 (occupied), 3 (ortho), and 5 (para). So the possible positions for nitro are 3,4,5.

But the target has nitro at 3. So position 3 is ortho to the tert-butyl group and meta to the ethoxy group.

Wait, but ethoxy is a stronger director. Maybe the nitro group would be directed to 4 or 5. But that's not matching the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being introduced in a position that is activated by both substituents.

Wait, maybe if the ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, the only position that is para to ethoxy and also ortho to tert-butyl is position 3.

Wait, no. Ethoxy at 1: para is 4. Tert-butyl at 2: ortho is 3. So position 3 is ortho to 2, and meta to 1. So the nitro group would go to position 3.

But how? Because ethoxy directs to 2 (occupied) and 4. How would the nitro group go to 3, which is meta to ethoxy?

Ah, maybe steric effects come into play. The tert-butyl group is bulky, so when adding the third substituent, the nitro group might be forced to go into the less hindered position, which is 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that is ortho to the tert-butyl group. Because tert-butyl is a stronger director than ethoxy in this scenario.

Wait, but ethoxy is a stronger activating group. Maybe in this case, the tert-butyl is a better director because it's a larger substituent, making the ortho positions more accessible.

Alternatively, maybe the directing is a combination of both substituents. The available positions that are ortho/para to either substituent.

In this scenario, the possible positions for nitro would be 3 (ortho to 2), 4 (para to 1), and 5 (para to 2). But the target has nitro at 3.

So the nitro group must go to position 3. So, in this case, the tert-butyl's directing effect is more influential in positioning the nitro group.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the reaction steps.

In the options, each option lists a series of reactions. Let's try to figure out which option would result in the substituents being added in the correct order.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps i to ix.

i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So adds tert-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitration.

iv) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation.

iii) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis, maybe of a diazonium salt.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ ethoxy group via alkylation? Or perhaps a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but AlCl3 is a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts, and maybe for other reactions.

Wait, but each option's sequence is a bit complicated. Let me think about the steps required.

The target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. So the reactions likely involve:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl.

2. Nitration to add nitro.

3. Perhaps some sulfonation or other steps, but maybe ethoxylation via another Friedel-Crafts? Wait, no, ethoxy is an ether, so maybe it's introduced via nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but benzene can't undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation for ethoxy because ethoxy isn't an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps introducing ethoxy as an ether via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires activating groups.

Hmm, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction, like using a diazonium salt.

Wait, another approach: perhaps introducing the ethoxy group via an alkoxy group substitution. For example, first install a good leaving group, then substitute it with ethoxy.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with nitro groups. But nitro is deactivating, so that might not work.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a SN2 mechanism, but benzene isn't good for that. So another approach.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamon ether synthesis, but that's for making ethers from alky halides and alkoxide ions. Not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is introduced via an alkylation after activating the ring. For example, using a benzene with activating groups, then introducing the ethoxy.

Wait, but I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think about the steps in each option.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ probably a reduction step, like converting nitro to amine.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation.

vii) dilute H2SO4 â†’ maybe hydrolysis or something else.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis of a nitro group? Or another step.

ix) NaOH/EtBr â†’ perhaps ethoxy group via substitution.

Wait, this seems a bit complicated. Let me think about each step.

Nitration first (i): benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

Then Fe/HCl (ii): reduces nitro group to amine. So nitrobenzene â†’ aniline.

Then Friedel-Crafts alkylation (iii): aniline reacts with tert-butyl chloride. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, which would undergo Friedel-Crafts. But Friedel-Crafts requires a Lewis acid catalyst, and AlCl3 is provided. So tert-butyl group would be added. Where? Aniline is strongly activating, so the tert-butyl would add in an ortho or para position. But the target has substituents in positions 1,2,3.

Wait, but after nitration and reduction, the substituent is at position 1 (if the first nitration was at a particular position). Then, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would add in ortho or para to the amine group.

But I'm not sure. Let's think: after nitration, the nitro group is at position 1. Then reduced to amine at 1. Friedel-Crafts adds tert-butyl to ortho (2) or para (4) positions. Let's say it's at position 2. Now, the ring has amine (1) and tert-butyl (2).

Next step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again. So nitration of aniline derivative. But aniline is strongly activating, so the nitro group would enter in ortho or para to the amine. But the amine is at 1, and the ring already has substituents at 1 and 2. So the nitro group would go to position 4 (para to 1), assuming that positions 3 is adjacent to 2 and might be hindered by the tert-butyl group.

But the target has nitro at position 3. Hmm, this doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iv is on the tert-butyl group. Wait, but the tert-butyl is an alkyl group; nitration would be directed by the amino group.

Wait, maybe this option isn't the right one. Let's look at another option.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts â†’ tert-butyl group added to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate. Nitro group would be added ortho or para to the tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ ethoxy group via alkylation.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 â†’ ? Maybe hydrolysis.

But I'm not sure about the order. Let me try to think through.

After step i: benzene â†’  tert-butyl benzene (let's say at position 1).

Step ii: nitrate â†’ nitro group added. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, the nitro would go ortho (2) or para (4).

Let's say nitro at 2. Now, substituents at 1 (tert-butyl) and 2 (nitro).

Step iii: Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine. So 2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene â†’ 2-amino-tert-butylbenzene.

Step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again. The ring now has an amine group (activating, ortho/para), and a tert-butyl group (activating, ortho/para). The new nitro group would be directed by these. Let's see, the existing substituents are at 1 and 2. The amine is at 2, tert-butyl at 1.

So the new nitro group would be added ortho or para to the amine (position 2). Ortho would be 1 (occupied by tert-butyl) or 3. Para to 2 is 6. So nitro could go to 3 or 6.

But the target has nitro at 3. So perhaps the nitro is added at 3.

Then step v: NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization. So the amine at 2 would form a diazonium salt.

Step vi: H3O+ and heat â†’ hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a nitro group. Wait, but if the diazonium salt is at 2, upon hydrolysis, it would become a nitro group. But that would revert the nitro group back, which might not make sense.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Maybe this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps after the second nitration, there's another substituent. But this is getting too tangled.

Maybe let's look at option C.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivating, meta director.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 â†’ maybe sulfonate removal.

ix) NaOH/EtBr â†’ ethoxy group via alkylation.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me think about the steps.

After step i: benzene â†’ tert-butyl benzene.

Step ii: sulfonate. Since tert-butyl is activating, the sulfonic acid group would be added para to it. So after sulfonation, the ring has substituents at 1 (tert-butyl) and 4 (sulfonic acid).

Step iii: nitrate. The ring now has a sulfonic acid group (strong deactivating, meta) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The nitration would be directed by the more powerful director. Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, so it's a meta director. Nitration would likely occur meta to the sulfonic acid.

So sulfonic acid is at 4. Nitro would go to position 1 (but already occupied by tert-butyl), 7? No, benzene is a six-membered ring. Wait, positions adjacent: sulfonic acid at 4. The meta positions would be 1 (occupied), 7 (which is same as 1?), wait no, benzene only has 6 positions. So perhaps position 6 and 2 would be meta to 4.

Wait, numbering: if substituent is at 4, meta positions are 1 and 7, but 7 is the same as 1. Alternatively, perhaps the meta positions are 6 and 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think of benzene with substituent at position 1. Sulfonic acid at position 4. So positions 1, 4. Then, nitro could be added at position 2 or 6, which are meta to the sulfonic acid.

Wait, but the tert-butyl is at position 1, which is an activating group, so it would direct the nitro to ortho (2) or para (4, occupied). So in this case, nitro would go to position 2, which is ortho to tert-butyl and meta to sulfonic acid.

So after step iii, substituents are at 1 (tert-butyl), 4 (sulfonic acid), 2 (nitro).

Step iv: Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro (at 2) to amine. So amine at 2.

Step v: NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization. Amine at 2 becomes diazonium.

Step vi: HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again. Not sure why this would happen.

Wait, maybe after diazotization, the diazonium salt could undergo some reaction. But in step vi, it's nitrated again? That seems odd.

Step vii: H3O+ and heat â†’ hydrolysis of diazonium salt. That would convert the diazonium group to a nitro group. But then why introduce it earlier?

This seems like a convoluted path, and I'm not sure if it leads to the desired product.

Let me try to move to option D.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ Friedel-Crafts.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 â†’ ?

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr â†’ ethoxy.

Hmm. Let's think.

Step i: benzene â†’ nitrobenzene.

Step ii: reduce nitro to amine â†’ aniline.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl chloride â†’ add tert-butyl to aniline. Aniline is a strong activating group, so the tert-butyl would add ortho or para. Let's say para (4), so the ring now has amine at 1 and tert-butyl at 4.

Step iv: nitrate again. The ring has amine (1) and tert-butyl (4). The nitration would be directed by the amine (strong activating), so nitro would go ortho (2) or para (4, occupied). So nitro at 2.

Now substituents at 1 (amine), 2 (nitro), 4 (tert-butyl).

Step v: NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization of amine at 1 â†’ diazonium.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 â†’ sulfonate. Where? The ring has substituents at 1 (diazonium), 2 (nitro), 4 (tert-butyl). Sulfonation would occur directed by the substituents. Nitro is a meta director, tert-butyl is activating, ortho/para.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. I'm not sure if this leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to introduce the ethoxy group last.

Wait, looking back, the target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So the order could be:

1. Add tert-butyl (position 2).

2. Add ethoxy (position 1).

3. Add nitro (position 3).

But how to arrange the reactions.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via SN2 or some other method. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's difficult because ethoxy is not an alkyl halide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring needs to be strongly activated. So nitro groups are deactivating, but maybe if there are enough activating groups, it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamon synthesis, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. For example, first install a nitro group, then reduce it to an amine, which can be alkylated to introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that's for ketone groups.

This is getting quite tangled. Maybe I should look for the correct sequence of reactions in the options.

Looking back, the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in positions 1,2,3.

Therefore, the steps likely involve:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl.

2. Nitration to add nitro in a position adjacent to the tert-butyl.

3. Introduction of ethoxy group, possibly via alkylation.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Option D includes steps like nitration first, then reduction, then alkylation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is adding tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction steps are:

- Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl.

- Nitration to add nitro (directed by tert-butyl, so at position 3).

- Then, introduce ethoxy via another Friedel-Crafts? But ethoxy isn't an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps using an ethyl halide with a good directing group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an alkylation after the ring has activating groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution, using a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamon-type approach but for aryl ethers. That requires a good leaving group, like a tosylate.

But perhaps the steps are:

- Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

- Then introduce a good leaving group (like a nitro group) in a specific position, then substitute it with ethoxy.

But nitro is meta, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after the ring has a nitro group, which is a meta director.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the option where the nitro group is added in position 3 relative to the tert-butyl group.

Wait, in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to the tert-butyl at 2.

Wait, no. Position 3 is adjacent to 2, so it's ortho to tert-butyl.

Ah, right, so the nitro group is ortho to the tert-butyl group.

So the order would be: add tert-butyl first, then nitro ortho to it, and finally ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with nitro groups. But nitro is deactivating, which makes substitution difficult.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires a good activating group.

Wait, but if the ring already has a nitro group, it's deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires the ring to be strongly activated, but nitro is deactivating.

Hmm. I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the presence of the tert-butyl group is bulky, which might influence the position where the nitro group is added.

So, to get nitro at position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl at 2), perhaps the nitration must be done after the tert-butyl is added.

So, let's think about the steps:

1. Benzene â†’ add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Nitrate â†’ nitro goes ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say ortho, so position 3.

3. Now, add ethoxy. How?

Wait, but after nitration, the ring has a nitro group (deactivating). So adding ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts is difficult because the ring is deactivated.

Therefore, perhaps the ethoxy group must be added before the nitro group.

Ah! So the order would be:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add tert-butyl.

3. Add nitro.

So, first ethoxy is added, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how?

Let me see: benzene â†’ ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts? Wait, no, because ethoxy isn't an alkyl halide. Maybe via a different method.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after installing a leaving group. For example, install a nitro group, then reduce it to an amine, then alkylate to get ethoxy.

But that doesn't align with the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group. Let's say the ring has a nitro group, which is deactivating, so that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for an option where the nitro group is added before ethoxy and tert-butyl, but that doesn't make sense because nitro is deactivating.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the nitro group is present. But that would require the ring to have a strong activating group, which seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should think about the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 â†’ add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate, nitro goes ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's say at 2.

iii) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 â†’ nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl â†’ diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr â†’ introduce ethoxy.

Hmm, after step i, tert-butyl is at 1. Step ii, nitro at 2. Step iii, nitro becomes amine at 2. Step iv, nitrate again; the ring has amine at 2 and tert-butyl at 1. So the next nitro group would go para to the amine (position 5) or ortho (position 3). If it goes to 3, that's ortho to the amine and adjacent to tert-butyl.

Then step v: diazotize the amine at 2 â†’ diazonium.

Step vi: hydrolysis â†’ nitro group back at 2.

Wait, that seems to revert the nitration.

Hmm, perhaps not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Nitrate â†’ nitro at 2.

3. Reduce nitro to amine at 2.

4. Nitrate again â†’ where? The ring has amine at 2 and tert-butyl at 1. The new nitro would go para to amine, position 6.

5. Diazotization â†’ to amine at 2.

6. Hydrolysis â†’ nitro at 2.

7. Ethoxy via NaOH/EtBr: perhaps an alkoxy group substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe step vii: NaOH and EtBr is for an SN2 reaction, perhaps introducing ethoxy via a nucleophilic substitution.

But without a good leaving group, it's unclear.

This is getting too complicated.

Alternative approach: think about the order of substituents based on the options.

Looking at the target, the substituents are at positions 1,2,3.

Assuming that the tert-butyl is added first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to arrange the reactions.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl â†’ reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl.

vi) nitrate again.

vii) H3O+.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

After step i: benzene has tert-butyl at 1.

Step ii: sulfonate. Since tert-butyl is activating, the sulfonic acid would add para (4).

Step iii: nitrate. The ring has substituents 1 (tert-butyl) and 4 (sulfonic acid). Nitro would be directed by the more powerful group. Sulfonic acid is strong deactivating, so nitro would go meta to it. So positions 2 and 6.

So step iii: nitro at 2.

Now, substituents at 1 (tert-butyl), 2 (nitro), 4 (sulfonic acid).

Step iv: reduce nitro (2) to amine.

Step v: diazotize amine (2).

Step vi: nitrate again. The ring has amine at 2, tert-butyl at 1, and sulfonic acid at 4. Nitration would be directed by amine (activating), so nitro would go ortho (1, occupied) or para (5). So position 5.

Then step vii: hydrolysis of diazonium â†’ nitro at 2.

Step viii: dilute H2SO4 â†’ maybe remove the sulfonic acid group? Not sure.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr â†’ perhaps introduce ethoxy via an SN2 reaction. But without a good leaving group, it's unclear.

Hmm, perhaps this sequence is not right.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is D.

Option D steps:

i) nitrate â†’ nitro at 1.

ii) reduce â†’ amine at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts â†’ tert-butyl at 2.

iv) nitrate â†’ nitro at 3.

v) diazotize â†’ amine at 1 becomes diazonium.

vi) sulfonate â†’ sulfonic acid at 4.

vii) dilute H2SO4 â†’ maybe hydrolysis.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat â†’ hydrolysis of diazonium.

ix) NaOH/EtBr â†’ ethoxy.

Wait, trying to follow:

Step i: benzene â†’ nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce nitro to amine at 1.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts â†’ tert-butyl added. Since amine is at 1 (strong activating), tert-butyl adds ortho (2) or para (4). Let's say 2.

Now, substituents at 1 (amine) and 2 (tert-butyl).

Step iv: nitrate again. The ring has amine (1) and tert-butyl (2). Nitration would be directed by amine â†’ ortho (2, occupied) or para (4). So nitro at 4.

But target has nitro at 3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps after step iii, when tert-butyl is at 2, the next nitration (step iv) is directed by the tert-butyl, which is activating, so nitro goes ortho (3) or para (5). So nitro at 3.

So after step iv, substituents at 1 (amine), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Step v: diazotize amine at 1 â†’ diazonium.

Step vi: sulfonate. Where? The ring has substituents at 1,2,3. The strongest director is the amine (being reduced to diazonium), but perhaps sulfonic acid would add para to it, position 4.

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 â†’ maybe sulfonate is removed.

Step viii: H3O+ and heat â†’ hydrolysis of diazonium â†’ nitro at 1.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr â†’ ethoxy introduction. But how?

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. But the ring now has nitro groups, which are deactivating, making substitution difficult.

This is still not clear.

I think I'm stuck and perhaps should try to figure out which option correctly adds the substituents in the right order.

Wait, another angle: the target has nitro at position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl at 2. So the nitro must be added after the tert-butyl.

So the steps must involve adding tert-butyl first, then nitro in the ortho position. Then, the ethoxy group is added in position 1.

But how to add ethoxy after nitro is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a Williamon synthesis after the ring has a leaving group, like a tosylate.

But I don't see any steps in the options that would generate a tosylate group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via an alkylation using NaOH and EtBr, which is a common method for substituting a good leaving group with an ethoxy group.

But when would that happen?

Looking at option B:

After several steps, step vii is NaOH/EtBr. So perhaps this is where the ethoxy is introduced.

But I'm not sure.

I think I'm running out of time and need to make an educated guess.

The correct option would first add tert-butyl, then nitro in the correct position, and then ethoxy.

Looking at the options, option D starts with nitration, which might not be ideal because it deactivates the ring. Option C starts with tert-butyl, then sulfonate, which is a strong deactivator, making further substitution difficult. Option B starts with tert-butyl, then nitrate, which is plausible.

After some consideration, the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Nitrate, adding nitro ortho to tert-butyl.

3. Introduce ethoxy group.

Looking for an option that does that.

Option B: steps i) tert-butyl, ii) nitrate, iii) reduce, iv) nitrate again, etc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in option B:

i) adds tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate â†’ nitro at 2.

iii) reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again â†’ where? The ring has amine (2) and tert-butyl (1). The new nitro would be added ortho (3) or para (5) to the amine.

If it's added at 3, that's ortho to amine and meta to tert-butyl. Then, step v: diazotize amine (2), step vi: hydrolysis â†’ nitro (2). Then step vii: ethoxy via NaOH/EtBr.

So after step vii, ethoxy would be introduced. But where?

Possibly at position 1, which is where the tert-butyl was initially added. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via substitution at position 4 or another position.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the key is to determine the correct sequence of reactions that introduces the substituents in the correct positions (ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3). The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Substituent Directing Effects**:
   - **Ethoxy (OCH2CH3)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **tert-Butyl**: Activating, ortho/para-directing but bulky.
   - **Nitro (NO2)**: Deactivating, meta-directing.

2. **Order of Substituent Addition**:
   - The nitro group should ideally be added last because it is deactivating, making the ring less reactive for subsequent reactions.
   - The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups, being activating, should be added first to control the directing effects for the nitro group.

3. **Reactions**:
   - **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation**: Used to add tert-butyl and ethoxy groups.
   - **Nitration**: Adds nitro groups, directed by existing substituents.
   - **Reduction (Fe/HCl)**: Converts nitro to amine groups.
   - **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl)**: Converts amines to diazonium salts.
   - **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat)**: Converts diazonium salts to nitro groups.
   - **NaOH/EtBr**: Likely introduces the ethoxy group via nucleophilic substitution.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- Starts with tert-butyl addition, followed by nitration, sulfonation, and other steps.
- The sequence does not align with the correct positions for the substituents, as the nitro group would not end up at position 3.

#### **Option B**:
- Sequence: tert-butyl addition â†’ nitration â†’ reduction â†’ nitration â†’ diazotization â†’ hydrolysis â†’ ethoxy introduction.
- After adding tert-butyl, nitration could place the nitro group at position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl). Subsequent steps may allow the nitro group to move to position 3, but the sequence is unclear and does not definitively lead to the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
- Sequence: tert-butyl addition â†’ sulfonation â†’ nitration â†’ reduction â†’ diazotization â†’ nitration â†’ hydrolysis â†’ sulfonate removal â†’ ethoxy introduction.
- Sulfonation introduces a strong deactivating group, making further substitution difficult. This sequence is unlikely to produce the target structure.

#### **Option D**:
- Sequence: Nitration â†’ reduction â†’ tert-butyl addition â†’ nitration â†’ diazotization â†’ sulfonation â†’ hydrolysis â†’ ethoxy introduction.
- Starts with nitration, which deactivates the ring, making subsequent reactions difficult. This sequence does not align with the correct positions for the substituents.

### Conclusion:
Option B provides the most plausible sequence. Starting with tert-butyl addition, followed by nitration, reduction, and subsequent steps, it is possible to achieve the correct positions for the substituents. The nitro group is directed ortho to the tert-butyl group, and the ethoxy group is introduced in the final steps.

**Answer: B**
