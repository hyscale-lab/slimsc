Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm. The question is about space travel and time dilation, right? I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation comes into play due to Einstein's theory of relativity. 

So, the problem says that an alien astronaut is 22 years old and wants to reach Earth. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. Wait, but the question is asking about the time experienced by the astronaut. So, I think this is a problem involving time dilation, where the astronaut's own experienced time is less due to their high speed.

Wait, let me think about the concepts. Time dilation occurs because time moves slower for the moving observer (the astronaut) relative to a stationary observer (like someone on Earth). So, from Earth's perspective, the astronaut's clock is ticking slower. But from the astronaut's point of view, the distance to Earth is contracted, so the trip takes less time.

Wait, but the question is about the astronaut's own lifetime. So, if the spaceship is moving at such a high speed, the astronaut's experienced time would be less than what Earth observers would calculate. But wait, the problem is about how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective, not from Earth's.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again. The question is asking how long it will take for the 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from their own perspective. So, we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the journey.

So, first, I need to find out how far Earth is from the Large Magellanic Cloud. Wait, wait, the spacecraft is coming from the LMC to Earth. Okay, I should probably look up the approximate distance between the LMC and Earth. Let me think, I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 170,000 light-years away from Earth. Let's approximate
