Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, the question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process. I remember that when high-energy gamma rays collide with lower-energy photons, like the CMB, they can produce electron-positron pairs. This process is relevant for determining how far these gamma rays can travel before annihilating.

Wait, the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. That's a very low energy, which makes sense since the CMB photons are from the afterglow of the Big Bang and are microwave radiation.

So, the reaction is γγ → e+ e-. I think the key here is to find the energy where the interaction rate of the gamma ray with CMB photons becomes significant, thereby limiting its lifetime.

I remember that the cross-section for pair production by a gamma ray with a photon is a function of the center-of-mass energy. The threshold for this reaction is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the electron mass, because each electron has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV. So the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) needs to be at least 1.022 MeV.

But wait, the two photons are from different sources: one is the gamma-ray (high energy) and the other is a CMB photon (low energy). Let me think about the center-of-mass energy in this case.

The energy of the gamma-ray is E, and the CMB photon has energy E_cm = 1e-3 eV. So the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is related to the sum of their energies and their momenta. But photons are massless, so their energy equals their momentum times c. So perhaps I can write the invariant s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (p_γ c + p_cmb c)^2.

Wait, no, more accurately, the invariant squared is s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (p_γ c + p_cmb c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions (assuming a head-on collision, which is the most probable scenario for pair production), their momenta would be in opposite directions, so p_cmb c is subtracted? Or is it added? Wait, no, for head-on, the momenta vectors are opposite, so if the gamma is moving in +x, the CMB photon is moving in -x. So in the invariant s, the momentum terms would subtract.

Wait, I think I need to calculate s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (p_γ c - p_cmb c)^2, since p_cmb is opposite to p_γ in this scenario. But since photons have E = pc, so E_γ = p_γ c and E_cmb = p_cmb c. So s becomes (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (E_γ - E_cmb)^2.

Let me compute that:

s = [E_γ + E_cmb]^2 - [E_γ - E_cmb]^2
= [ (E_γ)^2 + 2 E_γ E_cmb + (E_cmb)^2 ) ] - [ (E_γ)^2 - 2 E_γ E_cmb + (E_cmb)^2 ) ]
= 4 E_γ E_cmb.

So s = 4 E_γ E_cmb. Therefore, sqrt(s) is 2 sqrt(E_γ E_cmb).

The threshold for pair production is when sqrt(s) is at least equal to 2 m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV.

So, setting 2 sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) ≥ 2 * m_e c².

Wait, wait, because 2 sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) = sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c².

Wait, no. The threshold condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c². So,

2 sqrt(E_γ * E_cmb) ≥ 2 m_e c².

Divide both sides by 2:

sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) ≥ m_e c².

Square both sides:

E_γ E_cmb ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

So E_γ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E_cmb.

Plugging in the numbers, m_e c² is 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

E_cmb is 1e-3 eV.

So E_γ ≥ (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511e6)^2 * 1e3 eV.

Wait, let's compute that.

(0.511e6 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * (1e10) (eV)^2 = approximately 26.1121e10 (eV²).

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 26.1121e10 / 1e-3 = 26.1121e13 eV.

Wait, 26.11e13 eV is 2.611e14 eV.

Wait, but wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 2.611e14 eV is 261.1 GeV.

Wait, that seems lower than the options provided. The options are in the range of 1e5 GeV, which is 1e14 eV. So 261 GeV is way smaller than the options given.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's double-check.

Wait, the formula is E_γ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E_cmb.

Wait, m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So,

(0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² = 0.261121e12 eV².

Divided by E_cmb = 1e-3 eV: 0.261121e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261121e15 eV.

Which is 2.61121e14 eV. Because 0.261121e15 is 2.61121e14. Oh wait, 0.261121e15 is 2.61121e14? Let me see: 0.261121e15 = 2.61121e14.

So 2.61121e14 eV is 261.121 GeV.

Wait, but the options are much higher: the lowest option is about 9.5e4 GeV, which is 9.5e4 GeV = 9.5e4 * 1e9 eV = 9.5e13 eV. Which is way higher than my calculated 2.6e14 eV, which is 261 GeV.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the approach isn't correct. Maybe I should consider the optical depth and the process that limits the lifetime. The lifetime is limited when the interaction rate is significant. The interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the photon density.

The lifetime τ is approximately the inverse of the interaction rate Γ, where Γ ≈ n_photon * σ * v, where v is the relative velocity. But for high-energy photons, the relative velocity is approximately c.

Alternatively, the mean free path λ = 1 / (n σ v). So, the lifetime is limited when the photon travels a distance comparable to the mean free path.

The CMB photon density n is approximately the critical density. The critical density of the universe is about ρ_crit ≈ 9.9e-27 kg/m³. But wait, the CMB photons contribute to the radiation density. The photon density can be calculated from the CMB temperature.

The average energy density of the CMB is u = (8π/15) k_B T^4, where T is about 2.7 K. So T ≈ 0.000234 eV (since k_B is ~8.617e-5 eV/K), so T ≈ 2.7 K → 2.7 * 8.617e-5 ≈ 2.326e-4 eV. Hmm, wait, but the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, so maybe that's given and we can use that instead.

The number density of CMB photons is n = u / ( (3/4) E_avg ), because the average energy per photon is E_avg. Wait, no, the average energy for a photon gas in thermal equilibrium is (3/4) k_B T. But perhaps it's easier to use the formula n = (2 * u_photon) / (E_photon), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the number density of CMB photons can be approximated as n ≈ 411 photons per cm³. Wait, I think that's the figure. Let me recall: the CMB density is about (1e-3 erg/cm³) for photons, and each photon has about k_B T ~ 0.001 eV (since T is 2.7 K → 0.00023 eV, but perhaps the average energy is about 1e-3 eV as given in the problem). Wait, the problem says E_cmb is 1e-3 eV, so perhaps the energy density u is n * E_avg.

Wait, if E_avg is given as 1e-3 eV, and the energy density u is (n) * (average energy per photon) times some factor. Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed with the given E_cmb as 1e-3 eV.

So, the cross-section for pair production by a gamma photon and CMB photon is given by the Klein-Nishina formula, but for high energies (gamma >> E_cmb), it approaches the cross-section for a photon colliding with a blackbody photon, which is similar to the Thomson cross-section but scaled by some factors.

Wait, but the cross-section for pair production via γγ → e+ e- is a function of the center-of-mass energy. So the cross-section σ is non-zero only when the center-of-mass energy is above 2 m_e c².

The cross-section as a function of the gamma-ray energy E can be approximated when E is much larger than the CMB photon energy E_cmb. In that case, the cross-section σ is roughly given by:

σ ≈ (σ_T / 4) * (4 m_e^2 c^4) / (E E_cmb),

where σ_T is the Thomson cross-section, about 6.65e-25 m². I'm not entirely confident about this formula, but I think it's something like that.

Wait, I found a formula in my notes: the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ(E) = (4/3) π (m_e^2 c^4) / (E^2) * ln(2 E / m_e c²),

but I'm not sure. Alternatively, when E_γ is much larger than E_cmb, the cross-section can be approximated as σ ≈ (σ_T) * (m_e c^2)^2 / (E_γ E_cmb).

Wait, that might be the case. Let me think: the cross-section for photon-photon pair production has a typical form that depends on the product of the photon energies in the denominator.

So, another approach: the cross-section is σ = (4 π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_γ E_cmb) * [ ln( (E_γ + E_cmb)/(m_e c^2) ) - 0.5 ].

But perhaps for high-energy gamma rays where E_γ >> E_cmb, this simplifies. The logarithm would be approximately ln(E_γ/(m_e c^2)).

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the exact form isn't needed, as it's a multiple-choice question, and we can think in terms of scaling.

The interaction rate Γ is the product of the cross-section σ and the number of target photons n, and the relative velocity v (approx c). So Γ ≈ n σ c.

The lifetime τ is roughly 1/Γ. So τ = 1/(n σ c).

The problem states that the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process. So, the mean free path λ = v * τ ≈ c * τ ≈ c/(n σ c) )= 1/(n σ).

Wait, but the mean free path λ is the distance the gamma would travel before annihilating. If λ is much smaller than the size of the universe, the gamma's lifetime is effectively limited.

But perhaps the condition is that the interaction happens on a timescale comparable to the age of the universe. So the age of the universe is about 1e10 years, which is about 3e17 seconds.

But perhaps we can approach it using the optical depth. The optical depth τ is the product of the cross-section, the photon density, and the path length L: τ = n σ L.

When τ ≈ 1, the process is likely to have occurred once. So L ≈ 1/(n σ). So the gamma-ray would have a mean free path of L ≈ 1/(n σ).

But back to the problem: we need to find the energy E_γ where the interaction becomes efficient enough to limit the photon's lifetime. So the gamma-ray's lifetime is determined by the inverse of the interaction rate.

But perhaps we can relate the energy E_γ using the condition that the interaction becomes significant when the cross-section multiplied by the photon density is of order 1. But I'm not entirely clear on that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a simple one where the condition for pair production is E_γ E_cmb ≈ (m_e c^2)^2. Because the threshold is when the product E_γ E_cmb is about (m_e c^2)^2.

So, let's compute E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb.

Plugging in the numbers:

(m_e c^2) is 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

So,

E_γ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) )= 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 GeV.

But the options are on the order of 1e5 GeV, which is much larger. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the threshold is incorrect. Because the cross-section isn't just zero at the threshold but becomes non-zero above it. However, the calculation I did earlier gave 261 GeV, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 9.5e4 GeV = 9.5e4 GeV = 9.5e4 * 1e9 eV = 9.5e13 eV.

B) 1.8e5 GeV = 1.8e5 *1e9 eV = 1.8e14 eV.

C) 2.6e5 GeV = 2.6e14 eV.

D) 3.9e5 GeV = 3.9e14 eV.

Wait, 2.6e14 eV is 260 GeV, which is close to option C (2.6e5 GeV is 2.6e14 eV? Wait, wait, no. Because 2.6e5 GeV is 2.6e5 * 1e9 eV = 2.6e14 eV. Oh wait, that's 260,000 GeV, which is 260,000 * 1e9 eV = 2.6e14 eV. Wait, that's the same as our calculation of 2.6e14 eV, which is 260 GeV? No, wait: 2.6e14 eV is 260,000 GeV, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.6e14 eV is 260,000 GeV, which is 260 TeV.

Wait, but earlier I thought the calculation gave 261 GeV. That's a big difference. So perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 = 0.261 * 1e12 eV² = 2.61e11 eV². Then, divided by E_cmb of 1e-3 eV: 2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV.

So E_γ is 2.61e14 eV, which is 2.61e5 GeV (since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV; 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 * 1e9 eV = 2.61e5 GeV). Oh wait! So that's 261,000 GeV, or 261 TeV.

Looking at the options:

C) is 2.6e5 GeV, which matches exactly.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for pair production. The reaction requires the center-of-mass energy of the system to be at least twice the electron rest energy, $2m_e c^2 = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$. 

The invariant center-of-mass energy squared, $s$, for a collision between a high-energy gamma-ray of energy $E_\gamma$ and a CMB photon of energy $E_{\text{CMB}}$ is given by:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (p_\gamma c - p_{\text{CMB}} c)^2,
\]

where $p_\gamma c = E_\gamma$ and $p_{\text{CMB}} c = E_{\text{CMB}}$ for massless photons. Simplifying, we find:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}.
\]

At the threshold, $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$, so:

\[
2 \sqrt{E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}} = 2m_e c^2.
\]

Dividing through by 2 and squaring both sides gives:

\[
E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} = (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Rearranging for $E_\gamma$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$ and $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} \, \text{eV}.
\]

First, calculate $(0.511 \times 10^6)^2$:

\[
(0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This matches option **C**, which is $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Therefore, the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process is **2.6 × 10⁵ GeV**.
