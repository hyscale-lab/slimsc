Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions. Let's break down the given information and the steps.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form Compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form Compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form Compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form Compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So, this suggests that A is an aldehyde or ketone because Wittig reagents react with them to form alkenes.

The product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize that structure. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propenylidene group, which is a substituent like (CH2CH(CH3)CH2). Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's (CH2CH(CH3)) with a double bond. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is the substituent where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 of propane. So, it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached as a substituent on the cyclopentane.

Wait, no, the substituent is a propenylidene group. Let me think: propan-2-ylidene would be like CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? No, wait, the ylidene is a double bond adjacent to the point of attachment. So, the substituent is (propan-2-ylidene) which would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, perhaps more accurately, it's CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's that the substituent is an allyl group attached via the middle carbon. Hmm, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally as a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 being methyl groups, and at position 4, a substituent which is a propenyl group attached in a way that the double bond is between the first and second carbon (like CH2=CHCH2- attached to the cyclopentane at the middle carbon).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the substituent structure, but maybe the key point is that A is a carbonyl compound because the Wittig reaction needs that. So, A is either a ketone or aldehyde.

Hint b: The IR of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's
