Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. They gave the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, and we have four options to choose from.

Wait, first I need to remember what K means in this context. Formation constant, right? So K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, wait. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex ion, [CaEDTA^2-], right? Because the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the setup is: K = [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the complex is 0.02 M, that's the numerator. But what about the denominator? I think that since EDTA is in excess, maybe [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the initial concentration minus the amount that forms the complex? Wait, but if the problem is assuming that the pH is ideal, perhaps it's under such conditions that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and in excess, so that [EDTA^4-] is much larger than [Ca²+], making the change negligible. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. The solution says that the concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, we have Ca²+ and EDTA in solution, but once they form the complex, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4- will be much lower, right?

Wait, but the problem is probably considering the assumption that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. No, wait, no. Because [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, but that's the concentration of the complex, so the free Ca²+ and free EDTA must be determined from the K value.

Let me try to model this.

The formation reaction:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

The K is given as 5e10, which is really large. So the complex is very stable, meaning that the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4- will be very low.

Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M.

Let the free [Ca²+] be x, and free [EDTA^4-] be y.

Then, K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

So, 0.02/(x * y) = 5e
