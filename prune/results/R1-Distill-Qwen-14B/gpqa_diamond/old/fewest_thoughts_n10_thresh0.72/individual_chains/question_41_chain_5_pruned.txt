Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The options are about what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that when you're dealing with moving media, things get a bit tricky because of relativity. Oh wait, but this is a glass moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's non-relativistic? The problem says to take c=1, which simplifies things because we can treat speeds as fractions of c.

In a stationary glass, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c over the speed of light in the medium. So if the medium were stationary, speed v_light = c/n.

But here, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. Wait, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the beam is moving towards the observer as well, because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is in the same direction.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the beam's direction relative to the lab frame.

Wait, in the lab frame, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, which is towards the observer. So the beam is coming towards the observer, and the glass is also moving towards the observer. So the beam's direction is towards the observer, same as the glass's motion.

But I'm a bit confused. Let's try to model this.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. Now, we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v.

Wait, no. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the
