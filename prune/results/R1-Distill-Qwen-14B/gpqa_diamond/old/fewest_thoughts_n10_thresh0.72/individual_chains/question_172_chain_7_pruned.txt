Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the Boltzmann distribution applies here.

Right, Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and E_i and E_j are the energies of the states.

In this case, the energy difference is Î”E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Let's say the lower energy level is j and the higher is i. So for each star, the ratio of atoms in the higher level to the lower level depends on the temperature.

For star_1, the ratio is 2 (twice as excited, so n_i1 / n_j1 = 2). For star_2, the ratio is 1 (n_i2 / n_j2 = 1, since it's half as excited, right? Or wait, no. Wait, the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so their ratio is 2, and star_2's is 1? Or perhaps the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm.

Wait, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe the population in the excited state is twice as high in star_1. So, for star_1, n_i1 = 2 * n_i2. Or wait, perhaps the ratio is n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2). Because if star_1 has twice the excitation, their ratio would be double.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The problem says, "iron atoms in
