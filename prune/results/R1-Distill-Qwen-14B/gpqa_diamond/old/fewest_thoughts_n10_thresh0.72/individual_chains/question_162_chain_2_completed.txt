Okay, I need to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2 using the given metric. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, but this looks like a two-dimensional metric since it only has dx² and dy² terms. So maybe it's describing a surface in some way.

Wait a second, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Oh, right, the metric given is probably the induced metric on the pseudosphere embedded in some higher-dimensional space, or it's given in coordinates.

But I'm supposed to find the area of this pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. Hmm, radius in the case of a pseudosphere is a bit tricky because it's a surface of revolution, created by rotating a tractrix. But what's the area?

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere... I remember that for a sphere with radius R, the surface area is 4πR². But a pseudosphere is a different animal. Let me think about its properties.

Wait, no, wait. The pseudosphere is related to hyperbolic geometry. The area might be finite or infinite? Oh wait, I think the pseudosphere is an infinite surface. So its area might be infinite. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, looking at the metric, maybe I can compute the area using integration. The area element in a metric is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times d²x. But wait, since it's 2D, the area element would be sqrt(det g) dx dy.

Wait, the metric is given as ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy² + 2g_{xy} dx dy. In this case, g_{xy}=0 because there are no cross terms. So the metric tensor g is diagonal with entries [32/(4 - x² - y²), 32/(4 - x² - y²)].

So the determinant det(g) is g_xx * g_yy - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy=0, det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Then, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So that would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

So to find the area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is valid. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that the region where 4 - x² - y² > 0. Because if it's zero or negative, the denominator would be zero or negative, which would make the metric singular or imaginary, which doesn't make sense.

So the domain is x² + y² < 4. Wait, but this is a 2D metric, perhaps embedded in some higher dimension. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates (x, y) cover the entire pseudosphere.

Wait, but the pseudosphere's metric. Let me think about the standard parametrization. The metric for a pseudosphere can be written in terms of (x, y) coordinates as something like ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²) / (1 + (r/R)^2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the metric given is similar to a hyperbolic metric.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the area from the given metric.

So the area A is the integral over the entire space of the area element. So A = ∫∫ sqrt(det g) dx dy.

Which in this case becomes:

A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, integrated over the region where 4 - x² - y² > 0.

Wait, that's the same as the integral over the disk x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm. So let me compute this integral.

I can switch to polar coordinates, because of the circular symmetry. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. The denominator becomes (4 - r²).

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Breaking into radial and angular parts:

A = 32 * ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

The angular integral is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π * ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Simplify that:

A = 64π ∫0^2 [ r dr / (4 - r²) ].

Let me compute the integral ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me make a substitution: Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du/2) = r dr.

Wait, when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) du/u = (1/2) ∫ (0 to4) du/u.

Wait, wait, let me do that correctly.

∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] from 0 to 2.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → -(du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [ ( -du/(2) ) / u ]

Which equals (−1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) du/u = (−1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln u approaches negative infinity. So,

(−1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (−1/2) [ (-∞) - ln4 ] = (−1/2)(-∞) → which is positive infinity.

So the integral diverges. So the area A is 64π * (∞) → ∞.

Wait, so the area is infinite? But that doesn't make sense. Because a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Or is it?

Wait, wait. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric. Let me think again.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

Wait, that denominator is 4 - x² - y². So the region of integration is x² + y² <4. So it's a disk of radius 2. But the integrand is 32/(4 - r²), so as r approaches 2, the integrand becomes large. So the integral over r from 0 to 2 of (r dr)/(4 - r²) would indeed diverge, as when r approaches 2, denominator approaches 0.

So the area is infinite. So looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

But wait, is there any mistake in my reasoning? Because the pseudosphere is a finite surface, I thought. Wait, no, maybe no. Let me think about the area of a pseudosphere.

Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent but finite area? Or is it of finite area?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) is a surface of revolution with finite surface area. Oh, right! The area of a pseudosphere is 4π r^2, similar to a sphere. So for radius r=2, the area would be 4π*(2)^2=16π. But wait, that's not one of the options. The options given are A)0, B)4pi(x²+y²), C)4pi(x²−y²), D) +infty.

Wait, this is confusing. So according to the calculation with the given metric, the area is infinite. But according to what I thought about pseudospheres, the area is finite.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is not the standard pseudosphere metric. So I need to see the metric more carefully.

Wait, the given metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). Let me think about the standard metric for a pseudosphere. Wait, the standard parametrization of a pseudosphere uses coordinates (x, y) where x is the z-coordinate and y is the angle, but perhaps the metric looks like something else.

Alternatively, maybe the given metric is that of a sphere, but with a denominator indicating a different curvature.

Wait, another approach: compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric and see if it's negative.

The formula for Gaussian curvature K in terms of the metric coefficients is:

K = - (1/(2√g)) ∂_i ∂_j (ln √g) + (1/(4√g)) (∂_i ∂_j g_{kl} - ... ) 

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. For a metric of the form ds² = E(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2E)) Δ ln E, where Δ is the Laplacian in 2D.

In our case, E = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So let me compute the Laplacian of ln E.

First, ln E = ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²).

So the Laplacian of ln E is the Laplacian of -ln(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

In polar coordinates, the Laplacian of a radial function f(r) is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr).

So f(r) = -ln(4 - r²).

df/dr = [ 2r ] / (4 - r²).

Then, d/dr (r df/dr) = d/dr [ 2r²/(4 - r²) ].

Let me compute that derivative:

Let’s denote u = r², so 2u/(4 - u).

d/dr [ 2u/(4-u) ] = 2 [ (4 - u) * (2r) + u * r ] / (4 - u)^2 ?

Wait, actually, using quotient rule: [ (numerator derivative) * denominator - numerator * denominator derivative ] / denominator^2.

Numerator: 2u = 2r² → derivative is 4r.

Denominator: 4 - u → derivative is -du/dr = -2r.

So:

d/dr [2u/(4-u)] = [4r*(4-u) - 2u*(-2r)] / (4 -u)^2.

Simplify numerator:

4r(4 - u) +4r u = 4r(4 -u +u) )= 4r *4 = 16 r.

So the derivative is 16 r / (4 - u)^2 = 16 r / (4 - r²)^2.

Then, the Laplacian is (1/r) * (16 r)/(4 - r²)^2 ) = 16 / (4 - r²)^2.

So going back, the Laplacian of ln E is 16/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, K = - (1/(2E)) * (16/(4 - r²)^2).

But E is 32/(4 - r²).

So,

K = - (1/(2*(32/(4-r²))) )) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 )

Simplify:

= - ( (4 - r²)/(64) ) * (16)/(4 - r²)^2 )

= - (16 (4 - r²) ) / (64 (4 - r²)^2 ) )

= - (16) / (64 (4 - r²) )

= - (1/4) / (4 - r² )

So K = -1/(4(4 - r²)).

Wait, that's interesting. The Gaussian curvature K is negative, which confirms it's a pseudosphere (or hyperbolic surface). But what about the area?

Wait, earlier when I integrated, I found the area integral diverges. But since the curvature is varying with position, perhaps this is a surface with varying curvature, not a constant curvature pseudosphere. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, the standard pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So in this case, the curvature K is not constant but varies as 1/(4(4 - r²)). Hmm, that's varying with r. So perhaps this metric does not describe a pseudosphere, but some other surface.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature for a surface given by ds² = E(dx² + dy²) is K = - (1/(2E)) * (Δ ln E).

Wait, in our case, E = 32/(4 - r²).

So ln E = ln 32 - ln(4 - r²).

The Laplacian of ln E is the Laplacian of -ln(4 - r²).

In polar coordinates, the Laplacian of f(r) is (1/r) d/dr [ r df/dr ].

df/dr = (2 r)/(4 - r²).

So r df/dr = 2 r²/(4 - r²).

d/dr [ 2 r²/(4 - r²) ].

Using quotient rule: numerator 2 r², denominator 4 - r².

Derivative is [4r*(4 - r²) - 2 r² * (-2r)] / (4 - r²)^2.

Compute numerator:

4r*(4 - r²) + 4 r^3 = 16 r -4 r^3 + 4 r^3 = 16 r.

So d/dr [ ... ] = 16 r / (4 - r^2)^2.

Thus, the Laplacian is (1/r) * (16 r)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) = 16/(4 - r^2)^2.

So K = - (1/(2 E)) * (16)/(4 - r^2)^2 )

E =32/(4 - r^2), so 1/(2E) = (4 - r^2)/(64).

So K = - [ (4 - r^2)/(64) ) * (16)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

Simplify:

= - [ 16 (4 - r^2) ) / (64 (4 - r^2)^2) ) ]

= - [16/(64 (4 - r^2)) ) ]

= - [1/(4 (4 - r^2)) ) ]

= -1/(16 -4 r^2 )

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the denominator. Let me recompute:

No, wait, 4 - r^2 is (4 - r^2) squared in the denominator. So denominator is (4 - r^2)^2. So 4 - r^2 in numerator in the first term, and (4 - r^2)^2 in denominator.

So 4 - r^2 cancels once, leaving 1/(4 - r^2) in the denominator, so overall:

K = - (16) / (64 (4 - r^2)) )

Which simplifies to - (1/4) / (4 - r^2) ) → K = -1/(4(4 - r^2)).

Hmm, so the curvature is K = -1/(16 - 4 r²).

Wait, as r approaches 2, K approaches -1/(16 -16) → negative infinity. So the curvature becomes infinitely negative as r approaches 2. So that's why the metric's denominator goes to zero, leading to the area integral diverging.

So perhaps this is a different kind of surface. But the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, but a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature, so perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere. But the question is about the given metric and what's the area.

So according to the calculation, integrating the area leads to a divergence. So the area would be infinite, leading to option D.

But wait, maybe the given metric is for a different model. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the area calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the given metric isn't on the entire pseudosphere but just a part of it, leading to an infinite area.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed with a trick where the area is zero or something else.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0

B)4 pi(x^2 + y^2 )

C)4 pi (x^2 - y^2)

D) +infty.

Wait, but in my calculation, the area is infinite. So the answer would be D.

But why would the area be zero? Option A is zero. That doesn't make sense unless the region is empty. But the region is x² + y² <4, which is a disk of radius 2, so it's non-empty.

So, the area being infinite must be the correct answer, making the answer D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the standard pseudosphere has finite area, but perhaps that's a different parametrization. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the metric of a pseudosphere with another surface.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the metric indicating that the surface is a sphere with a certain radius, but with a different scaling.

Wait, another approach: consider that the metric is conformally flat, and the area can be found using the conformal factor.

The metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²) = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), where e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - r²).

The area would be the integral over the region of e^{2φ} dx dy.

But that's the same as what I did earlier, leading to an infinite area.

So, I think the correct answer is D, +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). 

### Key Observations:
1. **Metric Analysis**: The metric is conformally flat, with the conformal factor \( E = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The area element in such a metric is given by \( \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( \det g = E^2 \). Thus, the area element becomes:

   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

2. **Integration Domain**: The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) implies that the metric is valid for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), i.e., within a disk of radius 2 centered at the origin.

3. **Polar Coordinates**: To compute the area, switch to polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), where \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \). The area becomes:

   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Radial Integral**: Focusing on the radial part:

   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr,
   \]

   let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

   \[
   \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-du/2}{u} = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
   \]

   This integral diverges because \( \ln u \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the area integral diverges, and the area is infinite.

5. **Physical Interpretation**: The given metric does not describe a standard pseudosphere with constant negative curvature. Instead, the curvature varies with \( r \), becoming increasingly negative near \( r = 2 \), leading to the divergence of the area.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (0)**: Incorrect. The area cannot be zero because the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \) is non-empty.
- **Option B (\( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \))**: Incorrect. This expression is not dimensionally consistent with an area.
- **Option C (\( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \))**: Incorrect. Similar to Option B, this expression is not dimensionally consistent with an area.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\))**: Correct. The area integral diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \), leading to an infinite area.

### Conclusion:
The area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.

**Answer: D**
