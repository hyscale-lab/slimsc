Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I remember the Cope rearrangement isn't something I'm super confident about. But let's see if I can work through this.

The question has two parts. The first part involves a reaction using BuLi and then H+. The second part is a Cope rearrangement under heat. I need to find the major products A and B from these reactions and match them to the options given.

Let me start with the first reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me draw the structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an OCH2 group, and the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, the butenyl group would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)-, but wait, the numbering is 1-yl, so the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? Wait no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- so maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CH2-Ph? Or wait, no, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. So the substituent on benzene is OCH2-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl), which is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it correctly.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- (since the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, so the group starts at carbon 1). Wait, no: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-, and then the

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement is when a 1,5-diene rearranges. The question has two parts, A and B. 

First, part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Let me think about what BuLi does. BuLi is a strong base, a good nucleophile. Wait, in some reactions, BuLi can deprotonate compounds, especially where there are acidic hydrogens. 

Looking at the structure, the molecule is a benzene ring with a substituent that's (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy attached to a methyl group. So, the substituent is OCH2CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, no, the butenyl group is CH2CH2CHCH2? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-? Wait, maybe I should draw it. 

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl: the butenyl chain is four carbons. The double bond starts at the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O- but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy is OCH2CH2CH(CH3). Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- ? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, but thatâ€™s a four-carbon chain. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- no, wait, butenyl is four carbons. So, 1-yl means the substituent is on the first carbon. So, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait that can't be right because the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy, so the structure is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-? Wait, no, but the double bond is in the middle. Oh, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's five carbons. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=
