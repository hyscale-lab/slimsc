Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds sharing the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm, both singlets, in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, also singlets, but their ratio is 2:1:1.

Hmm, let's think about the aromatic region first. So, the signals around 6.7 ppm suggest that the aromatic protons are deshielded, which usually happens when they're para to substituents or in a conjugated system. But wait, in this case, the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes, which are all methyl groups attached to the benzene. So, maybe the substituents are causing some symmetry.

Wait, the NMR shows two singlets in the aromatic region. Each aromatic compound has some symmetry. I remember that in para-disubstituted benzene rings, the aromatic protons can be equivalent, leading to a singlet. So, if each compound has two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, but in this mixture we're seeing two singlets, maybe each compound contributes one singlet, but they're different. Wait, no. Because the two compounds are in a 1:1 ratio, so each contributes their own signals. But the aromatic region only has two signals, which suggests that each compound contributes one signal each. So each aromatic compound has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons, appearing as a singlet. So their structures must be such that they have equivalent protons in the aromatic ring, leading to a singlet.

Let me consider each of the options.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That's a benzene ring with four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So that's a para arrangement, but wait, 1,2,3,4? Wait, that's actually 1,2,3,4 being adjacent. Wait, no, 1,2,3,4 would be a ring where the substituents are at adjacent positions, but wait, that's impossible. Because in benzene, you can't have four substituents all adjacent. Oh wait, no, 1,2,3,4 is a meta arrangement? Or maybe it's a 1,2,3,4-tetra substitution, which would have substituents in positions 1,2,3,4. So that would have substituents every other position, perhaps, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, another way: 1,2,3,4 would be in a row, but that's not possible unless some are adjacent. Maybe in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4 in a way that some are
