Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and neutrinos are a byproduct. The pp chain is a series of reactions in the core, right? Oh wait, the pp-III branch is one of the branches in the proton-proton chain. I think the main pp-I branch produces helium-4, and the pp-II and pp-III are variations of that.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would take that long to be felt here. But since neutrinos are produced in the core and move almost at light speed, they would be affected immediately. So the flux of neutrinos we receive now depends on the Sun's current activity.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So flux(band1)/flux(band2) is what we're after.

I think the neutrinos in the Sun are produced mainly by the beta plus decay steps in the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch probably has a different neutrino emission compared to other branches.

Wait, the pp-III branch involves producing boron-8, which then decays into alpha particles and emits neutrinos. Let me think: in the pp chain, the main reaction is two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3. The helium-3 can combine in two ways: two of them make helium-4 (pp-I), or one can combine with a helium-3 to make boron-8 (pp-II and pp-III). The pp-III branch probably has a different branching ratio for when the helium-3 combines with another helium-3 to make boron-8.

When the pp-III branch stops, the production of boron-8 would stop. Boron-8 decays into alpha particles plus a beta plus decay, emitting neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the neutrinos from boron-8 decay would stop.

But wait, the neutrinos we detect are from the beta decay of boron-8, right? So if the pp
