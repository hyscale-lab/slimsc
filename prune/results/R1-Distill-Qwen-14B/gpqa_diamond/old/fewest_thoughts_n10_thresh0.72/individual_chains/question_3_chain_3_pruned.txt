Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle in a given state. Hmm, okay, I remember expectation values involve calculating the average outcome of a measurement over many trials.

The state of the particle is given as a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. I know that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. So they must be the basis states for σz. The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. So we need to find the expectation value of this operator in the given state.

Wait, expectation values are linear, right? So I think I can split this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and 5σx, then add them together. That should simplify things.

First, let's find the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. Oh wait no, wait, no. Wait, σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively. Because σz |↑⟩ = +|↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩. So when you measure σz, you get +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

But wait, the state is a superposition. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me check that. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. Oh, so 0.25 + 0.75 equals 1, so the state is normalized, which is good.

So, the expectation value of σz is given by the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. So, the probability of the state being |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and for |↓⟩ it's (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.75. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Wait, but wait, the operator in the problem is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value of that operator is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I need to find ⟨σx⟩ as well.

Hmm, how to find ⟨σx⟩. I remember that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which, in terms of the basis |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, swaps them and has some coefficients. The matrix representation of σx is [[0,1],[1,0
