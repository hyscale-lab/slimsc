Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the question gives me two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Each planet has different masses and radii: Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii; Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but since it's the same for both, maybe it cancels out in the ratio.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature... I remember that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. The formula, I think, is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), where a is the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but how do I find the orbital distances of the planets? The question mentions transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The shift is periodic because the planet orbits, causing the star to move back and forth.

The data given are the shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 up to 0.04 Å. I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, which would depend on their orbital distances because that affects the energy received from the star.

First, I think I should find the orbital periods or the mass functions, but maybe the shifts can give me the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital distance.

Wait, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The RV method measures the velocity of the star in the radial direction. The maximum Doppler shift (which is the semi-amplitude of the velocity) is given. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

But since the planets' masses are much smaller than the star's mass (which is 1.5 solar masses), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula approximates to:

K ≈ ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) )

But wait, I don't know the orbital periods P of the planets. The question doesn't provide that information directly. Oh, but maybe I can relate the Doppler shifts (velocities) to the masses and orbital distances.

Another approach: The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/
