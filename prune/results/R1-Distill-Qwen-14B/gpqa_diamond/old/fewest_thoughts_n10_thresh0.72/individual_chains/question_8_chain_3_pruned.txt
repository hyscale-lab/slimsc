Okay, I need to tackle this genetics problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done experiments with knock-out mutants and double mutants. The data shows the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type (which is 100%).

The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors regulate other genes, so their disruption could have downstream effects.

The data provided:
- g1: 75% resistance. So, less than wild type but not completely susceptible.
- g2: 0% resistance. So, completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% resistance.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10%
  - g2g3: 0%
  - g1g2: 0%

We need to figure out the interactions between G1, G2, and G3.

Hmm. Let's think about what each observation implies.

First, the single mutants. G2 is completely knocked out (0% resistance). That suggests that G2 is essential for resistance. If a plant can't produce G2, it's very susceptible. So maybe G2 is a key gene, perhaps a transcription factor.

G1 has 75% resistance. So, it's less than wild type but still has some resistance. G3 is at 50%, so more susceptible than G1 but less than G2.

Looking at the double mutants.

g1g2: 0%. Hmm. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0%. Since G2's single mutant is already 0%, maybe G1 normally contributes a little, but without G2, it's even worse or can't function. Wait, but if G2 is already causing 0% resistance, how does knocking out G1 make it worse? Or perhaps G1 is downstream of G2?

Wait, maybe G2 is upstream, like a transcription factor that activates G1. So if G2 is gone, G1 can't be expressed either. But in the single mutant g1, G1 is knocked out, but G2 is still functional. Hmm, but in g1, the resistance is 75%, which is worse than wild-type (100%), but better than g2 (0%).

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%. If both G1 and G2 are knocked out, perhaps they're in the same pathway, and each contributes a part of the resistance.

Another approach: think about epistasis. Epistasis is when one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. So, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the mutant phenotype of A is observed regardless of B's state.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% (same as g2). So the phenotype here is same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because when both are knocked out, the phenotype is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. So, the presence or absence of G1 doesn't change the phenotype in the absence of G2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, let's look at the other double mutants. 

g1g3: 10%. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but the resistance is worse than either single mutant (75% for g1, 50% for g3). So the double mutant is worse than either single, which suggests they might be in the same pathway, perhaps additive effects.

g2g3: 0% again. Same as g2. So when G2 and G3 are both knocked out, the phenotype is same as g2. So here, the presence of G3 mutation doesn't change the
