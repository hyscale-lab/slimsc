Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. So the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

Alright, let's list out the given data. Both stars have masses of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun, but I don't think mass directly affects the abundance ratios because the problem gives us the abundances already. Oh wait, maybe not. The problem says they're using the EW method under LTE conditions, so it's about how their abundances compare.

Given data:
- Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.
- Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

The Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, log(nMg/nH) = 7.5 -12? Wait no, wait the Sun's data is given as 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → so log(nMg/nH) is 7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check that again. The Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value. So for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=10^-4.5. Similarly for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but I need to find the silicon abundance in each star. So the ratio [Si/Fe] for Star_1 is 0.3, which is log(Si/Fe) =0.3
