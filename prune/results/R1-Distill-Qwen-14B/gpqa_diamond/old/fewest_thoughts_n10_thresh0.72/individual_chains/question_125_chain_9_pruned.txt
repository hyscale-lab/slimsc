Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm, it's about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. I remember that the potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². The question is about the energy levels and their degeneracy.

Wait, the harmonic oscillator in three dimensions is a standard problem. Oh right, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the energy depends on the total quantum number n, which is n = nx + ny + nz. But wait, for a three-dimensional oscillator, each direction (x, y, z) contributes energy levels. So the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ℏω, where n can be 0,1,2,... but wait, no, actually each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ℏω, so the total is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ℏω. So E = (n + 3/2) ℏω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

But wait, the states are degenerate because different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z can lead to the same n. The degeneracy, or the number of states with the same energy, is given by the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers. That's the number of partitions, I think it's like (n + 2 choose 2) or something like that? Oh right, for each n, the degeneracy is (n + 2)(n +1)/2? Or is it something else? Let me think. For a 3D isotropic oscillator, the degeneracy for a given n is (n + 2)(n +1)/2? Or perhaps it's (n+2 choose 2) which is the same as (n+2)(n+1)/2. Wait, for n=0, the degeneracy is 1 (only 0,0,0). For n=1, it's 3 (since n_x, n_y, n_z can each be 1 and others 0).
