Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about six different benzene derivatives reacting with excess bromine. The product is a monobrominated compound, but the position (ortho, meta, para) depends on the substituents. I need to arrange these substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer they produce. The order should be from least to most in terms of para yield.

Let's list the substituents for each:

1) ะก6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's an ethyl ester of benzoic acid, so the substituent is OCO2Et (ester group).
3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine substituent.
4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group.
5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethyl group.
6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group.

I remember that substituents on benzene can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups increase the reaction rate, usually direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups slow down the reaction and direct meta.

Let me recall each substituent's effect:

1. Methyl (CH3): It's an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it's ortho/para directing. So when bromine substitutes, the para product will be major.

2. Ester group (COOEt): Ester is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So it's meta directing. But wait, esters are meta directors. So the major product would be meta, meaning less para. Wait, wait, no. Wait, for the nitration or substitution, the ester is a meta director. So the substituent directs incoming groups to meta positions. So the para isomer would be less in this case.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Activating groups are ortho/para directors, while deactivating are meta directors. So ester is deactivating (because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing), so it's a meta director. So when the benzene ring has an ester group, the incoming Br would mainly go meta, leading to less para product.

3. Chlorine (Cl): Chlorine is an interesting substituent. It's a deactivating group because of the electronegativity, but it's ortho/para directing. Because although Cl is deactivating (due to -I effect), the +R (resonance) effect is stronger in some cases. Wait, no. Wait, Cl is actually ortho/para directing but deactivating. So when Cl is attached, the ring is less reactive but the substitution occurs at ortho and para positions more than meta. So the para product is major.

4. Nitro group (NO2): Nitro is a strong deactivating group, meta directing. So substitution occurs mainly in meta positions, making para product minor.

5. Ethyl
