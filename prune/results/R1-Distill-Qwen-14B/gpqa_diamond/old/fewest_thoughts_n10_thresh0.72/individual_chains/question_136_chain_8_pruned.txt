Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to solve. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember some key concepts from my studies.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². And the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, right. So, the vector field is radial, meaning it points directly away or towards the origin, and its magnitude is 1/r². So f(r) = (1/r²) er, where er is the unit radial vector in spherical coordinates.

The integral I need to compute is the volume integral of the divergence of f over the volume of the sphere. Mathematically, that's ∫ (∇ · f) dV within the sphere of radius R.

I remember that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. The divergence theorem states that ∫∫∫_V (∇ · F) dV = ∫∫_S F · dA, where S is the boundary surface of V. So, in this case, the volume integral would be equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere (the sphere of radius R).

But wait, another approach is to compute the divergence of f directly, then integrate it over the volume. Let me try both methods and see if they agree.

First, let me compute ∇ · f. Since f is a radial vector field, I can use the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. The general formula is:

∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) [d (F_θ sinθ)/dθ] + (1/(r sinθ)) [1/sinθ dφ/dφ] 

But since F has only a radial component and F_r = 1/r², the other components are zero. So the divergence simplifies.

So F = F_r er + 0 eθ + 0 eφ. Plugging into the divergence formula:

∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r) 

Because the other terms are zero. 

F_r is 1/r², so plugging that in:

∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) )

Simplify the expression inside the derivative: r² * 1/r² = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇ · F = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, that would mean the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin. Because at r=0, the field isn't defined (since f would be 1/0², which is undefined). So for points not at the origin, the divergence is zero.

But wait, the integral is over the volume. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral would be zero?

But wait, that can't be right because flux through a Gaussian surface (like a sphere) might not be zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in computing the divergence.

Wait, let me double-check. The divergence formula for a purely radial field
