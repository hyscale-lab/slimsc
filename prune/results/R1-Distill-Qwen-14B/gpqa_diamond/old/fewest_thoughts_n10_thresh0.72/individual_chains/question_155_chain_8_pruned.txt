Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z in a given state. The state is provided as a column vector, and the operators P_x, P_y, P_z are given in matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Hmm, but wait, the state is given as an eigenstate of P_x. That must complicate things a bit, but maybe it doesn't matter directly for calculating the uncertainty in P_z.

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The given state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this state as |ψ⟩. So ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That simplifies things because when you apply P_z to each basis vector, you just get the corresponding eigenvalue times the vector. So measuring P_z on each component would give the eigenvalues. But wait, the state isn't necessarily an eigenstate of P_z, right? It's an eigenstate of P_x. So the expectation values might not be as straightforward.

Let me write down the matrix for P_z. The matrix is:

[ ℏ    0    0  ]
[ 0    0    0  ]
[ 0    0   -ℏ ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ℏ, 0, -ℏ along the diagonal. The basis vectors are, I assume, |+⟩, |0⟩, |-⟩, corresponding to the eigenvalues ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

The state ψ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Let's denote the basis vectors as e1, e2, e3, where e1 is [1,0,0], e2 is [0,1,0], e3 is [0,0,1].

So ψ = (-1/2) e1 + (1/√2) e2 + (-1/2) e3.

Wait, but to calculate expectation values, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ for <P_z>, and ψ† P_z² ψ for <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So P_z² would be:

[ ℏ²   0     0   ]
[ 0    0     0   ]
[ 0    0    (ℏ)^2 ]

Wait, no. Wait
