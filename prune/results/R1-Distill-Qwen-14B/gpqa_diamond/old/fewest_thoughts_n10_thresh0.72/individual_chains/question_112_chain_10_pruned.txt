Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the probability of measuring certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the state given is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that when a state is proportional to something, we need to normalize it to find the actual state. So first step: normalize |alpha>.

Wait, normalization. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the norm squared is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. Let's compute that.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). So the magnitudes squared are |1+i|^2 and |2-i|^2.

|1+i|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i)=1+1=2.

|2 - i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4+1=5.

So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij. The matrix is given as Aij = hbar/2 if i !=
