Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the probability of a certain measurement outcome for an observable. 

Hmm, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me check that. So the components are -1, 2, and 1. Their squares would be 1, 4, and 1. Adding those gives 6. Oh, right, so this vector isn't normalized. That might be important later when calculating probabilities.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down matrix P as given. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. So P is a Hermitian matrix because observables are represented by Hermitian operators, right? Let me check if P is Hermitian. The elements should satisfy P_ij = P_ji*. 

Looking at P:
- The (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) is also 1/sqrt(2), which is real, so same as its complex conjugate. So that's good.
- (1,3) is 0, (3,1) is 0. Good.
- (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), so (3,2) is also 1/sqrt(2). So yes, P is Hermitian. So each diagonal element must be real. I see, the diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So P seems to be a valid observable matrix.

The question is about measuring the observable P and getting the outcome 0. Wait, what does that mean? In quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the matrix. So I guess I need to find the eigenvalues of P, and then find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, the probability is the square of the amplitude of the state vector in that eigenspace.

Wait, wait, but the observable P has certain eigenvalues. Let me find them. Alternatively, maybe P is a projection operator, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps P is an observable where one of the eigenvalues is 0, and the others are something else. Alternatively, perhaps P is a diagonal matrix, but it's not, so I need to find its eigenvalues.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can diagonalize matrix P. Let me try to compute its eigenvalues. Let's write down the characteristic equation.

The matrix P is:

[ 0        1/sqrt(2)  0      ]
[1/sqrt(2) 0       1/sqrt(2)]
[
