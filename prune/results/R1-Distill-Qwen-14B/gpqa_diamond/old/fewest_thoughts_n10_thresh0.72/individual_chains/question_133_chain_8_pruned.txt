Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The temperature is 25°C. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO₄³⁻, in this solution. The options are A to D with various values.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix different phosphoric acid salts, they can form a buffer solution. KH₂PO₄ is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is sodium phosphate dihydrogen dodecahydrate, I think. Wait, no, Na₂HPO₄ is sodium hydrogen phosphate or something like that. Let me get that right. So, the salts involved are a diprotic and a triprotic acid's salts?

Wait, no. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4⁻ (Ka1)
H2PO4⁻ ↔ H+ + HPO4²⁻ (Ka2)
HPO4²⁻ ↔ H+ + PO4³⁻ (Ka3)

So, when you have KH₂PO4, that's K+ and H2PO4⁻. And Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4²⁻. So, in solution, the ions would be H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻. These two can buffer the solution, and the orthophosphate ion is PO4³⁻. But wait, I'm being asked about PO4³⁻ concentration.

Wait, but are the H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ in solution going to
