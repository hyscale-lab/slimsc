Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two binary systems, system_1 and system_2.

Alright, the problem says both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. So system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year. I remember that in binary stars, the period is the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other once. 

Then, the radial velocity (RV) data is given. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. I think the RV amplitude is related to the mass of the companion. The more massive a star is, the less it moves because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the less massive star has a larger RV amplitude.

Wait, right! In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit (so smaller velocity variation) and the less massive has a larger orbit (so larger velocity variation). So the ratio of their masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocity amplitudes.

So let's denote system_1 as having stars with masses M1 and m1. Their RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. So M1/m1 = v1 / v2? Wait, no. Because M1 is the more massive, so m1's velocity is higher. So M1/m1 = (v1's amplitude) / (v2's amplitude)? Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

If M1 is larger, the velocity amplitude of m1 (the smaller mass) is higher. Because the center of mass is closer to M1. So the mass ratio (M1/m1) equals (v2's amplitude / v1's amplitude). Because M1 has a smaller velocity, so their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

So for system_1: M1 / m1 = v2 / v1 = 5 / 10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5. That means the total mass of system_1 is M1 + m1. Let's see, if M1 is 0.5 times m1, then M1 = 0.5 m1. So total mass is 0.5 m1 + m1 = 1.5 m1.

Wait, maybe I should express it differently. Let me denote K1 and K2 as the RV semi-amplitudes for each star. K1 for system_1 is 10, K2 is 5.

The mass ratio q = (M2) / (M1) = (K1) / (K2), where M1 is the mass of the more massive star, and M2 is the less massive. Wait, no, I think the formula is q = m1 / M1 = (K2) / (K1). Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So q is the mass of the smaller
