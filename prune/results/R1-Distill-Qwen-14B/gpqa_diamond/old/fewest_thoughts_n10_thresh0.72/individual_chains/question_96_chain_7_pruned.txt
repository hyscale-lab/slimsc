Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says: The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is θ=10^-17 degrees. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A) 10^62 J/K, B) 10^59, C) 10^66, D) 10^65.

Alright, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is something like S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where k is Boltzmann's constant, c is the speed of light, A is the area, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and G is the gravitational constant.

Wait, so the first thing I need to do is find the area of the event horizon. But to do that, I probably need the radius of the event horizon, which is the Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is proportional to the mass M of the black hole: R_s = 2 G M / c².

But how do I find M from the given information? Oh, right, we have the angular size θ. The angular size is given by θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius and d is the distance. Since θ is small, we can use the small angle approximation.

So θ (in radians) is approximately R / d. Let's convert θ from degrees to radians first. Since 1 degree is π/180 radians, θ = 10^-17 degrees is 10^-17 * (π/180) radians.

Calculating that: 10^-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. So θ ≈ 1.745e-19 rad.

Now, R ≈ θ * d. Wait, d is given as 1e10 parsecs. Hmm, I need to convert parsecs to meters to be consistent with SI units. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m.

So R ≈ θ * d = (1.745e-19) * (3.086e26) ≈ Let's compute that: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. 1.745 * 3.086 is about 5.38, so 5.38e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.38e7 m.

Wait, but R is the Schwarzschild radius, so R = 2 G M / c². Let's solve for M: M = (R c²) / (2 G).
