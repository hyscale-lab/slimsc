Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully and then go through each part to figure out what's going on.

The question is about a mixture X that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's a solvent. Also, X doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds.

So, the question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A) 16, B) 18, C) 22, D) 12.

Hmm. Let me think about each part.

First, mixture X is equimolar and decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water is a common reaction for alkenes (they undergo addition reactions). So X probably contains alkenes or maybe something else, but alkenes are a big possibility.

Then X is treated with platinum and heated, leading to a disproportionation reaction. Wait, what's a disproportionation reaction? Oh right, it's when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, for example, in the case of certain alkenes under such conditions, maybe a diene or something else.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Oh, so maybe X contains two different alkenes that react. When they undergo a reaction (disproportionation), they form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two liquids, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y doesn't have any alkenes anymore. Because if it did, bromine water would decolorize.

So what could cause alkenes to change into something else upon heating with platinum? Oh, wait, maybe it's a reaction like the addition of hydrogen. But no, because that would add H2 and make a single product. But here, the result is two products Y, so it's a different reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a dihydrogenation or some kind of partial hydrogenation?

Wait, but the problem
