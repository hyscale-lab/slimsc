Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that phase shifts are involved in scattering amplitudes. The question gives me some phase shifts: δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. And I'm supposed to ignore the rest. The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, all in units of fm.

Wait, the scattering amplitude... I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) in the case of elastic scattering can be expressed using the partial waves. Oh right, the Born approximation or something like that. The formula I recall is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) ... or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait no, the general expression for the scattering amplitude f(θ) in terms of partial waves is f(θ) = Σ [ (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik) ] * P_l(cosθ), where P_l are Legendre polynomials, and the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum.

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam. So along the incident direction, that's when θ=0°, right? Because the beam is coming straight in, so the angle with respect to the beam direction is zero. So cosθ would be 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1)=1 for all l. So in this case, the amplitude simplifies because all the Legendre polynomials evaluate to 1.

So f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l +1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) 

Wait, wait, let me get the formula right. The amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) ( e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) / (1 + cos(δ_l)) ) ] * P_l(cosθ). Hmm, maybe that's another form. Alternatively
