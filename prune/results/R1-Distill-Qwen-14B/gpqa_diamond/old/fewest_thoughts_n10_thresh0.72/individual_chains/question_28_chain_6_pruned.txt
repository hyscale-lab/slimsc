Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me go through each step carefully.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Let me draw that structure in my mind. It's a cyclohexenone ring, with a hydroxyl group on carbon 4. The substituents are: the ketone is at position 1, the double bond is between 2 and 3, and the hydroxyl is at 4. The configuration is S, which is important for the stereochemistry later.

First step: treating this with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine. I remember that these reagents are typically used for silylation, specifically to protect hydroxyl groups. Triethylamine probably acts as a base, deprotonating the hydroxyl to make it a better nucleophile. So the hydroxyl group on carbon 4 would get silylated. That would form an silyl ether, protecting the hydroxyl. So product 1 is the silyl-protected form of the starting material.

Second step: product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2. Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is a strong nucleophile and can perform conjugate additions. The starting molecule is a cyclohexenone, so the conjugate addition would happen at the alpha position. Wait, but the starting material is a cyclohexenone, so the conjugate addition would add to the carbonyl group. Let me think: in a cyclohexenone, the conjugate addition would be at the alpha position. So the reagent would add to the double bond. The Gilman reagent Ph2CuLi would add a benzyl group to the double bond. Wait, no, the Gilman reagent has a copper, so maybe it's a 1,4-addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the enone.

Wait, when you have a ketone with a conjugated double bond, like cyclohexenone, the conjugate addition (Michael addition) would add to the alpha position. So the Gilman reagent would add a benzyl group to the alpha position. Oh, wait, actually, the Gilman reagent is a cuprate that does a 1,4-addition. So in the case of the cyclohexenone, the cuprate would attack the carbonyl group's alpha carbon, but wait, no, cyclohexenone is a conjugated enone, so the cuprate would add to the gamma position? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the ketone is at C1. The hydroxyl is at C4. So the positions are 1 (ketone), 2 (double bond start), 3 (double
