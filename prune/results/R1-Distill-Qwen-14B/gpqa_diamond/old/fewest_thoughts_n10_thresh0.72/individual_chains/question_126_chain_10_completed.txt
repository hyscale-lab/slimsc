Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about two reactions, Reaction I and II, and then analyzing their products using HPLC. I need to figure out how many peaks each will give in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns.

Let me start by looking at Reaction I. The compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is a six-carbon chain, with a ketone group at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C=O. Let me count: 1, 2, 3 (the ketone at C3), so positions 4 and 5 would be CH2 and then CH(OCH3). So maybe it's more like CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2 something? Wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO. So positions 1 to 6: 1, 2, 3 (CO), 4,5,6. So 5-methoxy would be on C5, which is the fifth carbon. So structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, because it's hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is at C3. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that's seven carbons. Oh wait, hexan would be six carbons. So position 1: CH3, 2: CH2, 3: C=O, 4: CH2, 5: CH(OCH3), 6: CH3? Wait, no. Let me count. Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-?

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Because that's six carbons. So the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would have the methoxy on the fifth carbon, which is the fourth carbon from the ketone.

Reaction I is treating this with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the ketone group (C=O) at C3 will be reduced to a CH(OH) group. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait. LAH is a strong reducing agent that can also reduce esters, but here the starting material is a ketone. So the product is the secondary alcohol. But what about the configuration? The starting material is (S) configuration at C5.

Wait, the starting material's configuration is S at C5 because of the methoxy group. When the ketone is reduced, does that affect the configuration at C5? No, because the reduction is at C3. So the alcohol at C3 will have a new stereocenter, or not?

Wait, the ketone is at C3. When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, you're adding two hydrogens. The starting material is a ketone, which is planar, so the reduction could lead to either R or S configuration at C3. But wait, wait, the starting material's configuration is at C5, not C3.

So the starting material is (S) at C5. When we reduce the ketone at C3, it becomes an alcohol at C3, which is a new stereocenter. Because the ketone is at C3, the starting molecule is:

Positions:
1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH3

Wait, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? That's six carbons? Let me count.

Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, but the starting material is 5-methoxy, so at C5, which is the fifth carbon from the start.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. So the molecule is:

Positions:
1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH3

So when you reduce the ketone at C3, you add two hydrogens, turning it into a secondary alcohol. So the product will be:

CH3-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

But wait, the OH can be on either the R or S configuration, right? Because it's a new stereocenter.

Wait, but wait, the starting material was (S) at C5. So the configuration at C5 remains the same, but the new OH at C3 can form a new chiral center. So the product from Reaction I is (R) or (S) at C3 and (S) at C5.

Wait, but does the reduction create a new stereocenter? Yes, because the carbonyl was planar, so the hydride attacks from either side. But with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, the reaction is typically not stereoselective unless there's some kind of directing group, but in this case, the only groups are CH2 on either side. So the reduction would lead to a racemic mixture, right?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the molecule is (S) at C5. The reduction of the ketone at C3 adds an OH group, which creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is chiral, but the reduction of the ketone doesn't involve any neighboring chiral centers that would influence the outcome. So the product would have two chiral centers: the existing one at C5 (S configuration) and a new one at C3, which could be either R or S.

Wait, but LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically doesn't have any preference in the attack, so the product would be a racemic mixture at C3. So the product would be a mixture of (R) and (S) at C3, but the C5 remains S.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction occurs at C3, which is two carbons away. So maybe the configuration at C5 doesn't influence the configuration at C3. So the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, giving two diastereomers or maybe two enantiomers? Wait, no, because C5 is already chiral. So the product would be a mixture of diastereomers, each with their own configuration at C3.

Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone that's part of a chiral molecule, does the product retain any configuration from the starting material? Yes, because the C5 is not involved in the reduction. So the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Since C5 is already S, and C3 can be R or S in a racemic mixture, the product would have four possible stereoisomers? No, wait, because C3's configuration is either R or S, and C5 is fixed as S. So the product would be a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, each with C5 S and C3 R or S. So the product would have two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S) and (S,R)? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The starting material is (S) at C5. The reduction adds an OH at C3, which is a new chiral center. The configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction. If the reduction leads to a racemic mixture, then the product would have 50% R and 50% S at C3, each with C5 as S.

So the product would have two enantiomers: (R,S) and (S,S) as the configurations at C3 and C5, respectively. Wait, but actually, the product would have two possible configurations: C3 R or S, with C5 S fixed. So the product would be a mixture of two enantiomers, each having two stereocenters.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the two stereocenters are not in a symmetrical position. So the product would be a racemic mixture, but since the starting material is chiral, perhaps the product isn't a racemic mixture but a diastereomeric mixture. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the product of Reaction I is a single enantiomer. Wait, but no, because the reduction of the ketone would create a new stereocenter. If the starting material is chiral, but the reduction is not stereoselective, the product should have a new stereocenter in a racemic mixture. So the product would be a 50:50 mixture of (R,S) and (S,S) at the C3 and C5 positions.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it: the starting material is (S) at C5. The reduction of the ketone at C3 introduces a new stereocenter. Since the reduction is not stereoselective, the product will have a racemic mixture at C3. So the product would be a 50:50 mixture of the two possible configurations at C3. But the C5 remains S. So the product is a mixture of two enantiomers: one where C3 is R and the other where C3 is S. So this would lead to two peaks in a chiral HPLC, but all four stereoisomers? Wait, no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, so perhaps the product ends up with two stereoisomers, but as a racemic mix, leading to a single pair of enantiomers. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should move on to Reaction II and come back to this.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2CH2? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So 2,4-dione would be O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, because that's five carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, no. Let me think: the structure of pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would have three carbons between the two ketones. Wait, no, I think I'm getting it wrong. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-?

Wait, no, that would be four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. That's five carbons: positions 1 (O=C), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would be five carbons in total. So positions 2 and 4 are the ketones.

So when we treat this with NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, but it's selective for ketones. NaBH4 typically can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But since pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups, each adjacent to each other.

Wait, but when you have two ketones adjacent, like in pentane-2,4-dione, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Let me get the structure right.

Pentane-2,4-dione is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, because that would be 2 and 4 positions on a five-carbon chain. So yes, that makes sense.

So structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, no, because that would be a five-carbon chain with ketones on C2 and C4, which would mean the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's correct. So it's:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, that would be pentane-2,4-dione: O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait, wait.

Wait, pentane has five carbons. 2,4-dione would be:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: C=O

Carbon 5: CH3

So the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. No, that's six carbons. Wait, no, pentane has five. So CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. That's five carbons: positions 1 (CH3), 2 (C=O), 3 (CH2), 4 (C=O), 5 (CH3). So structure is (CH3)2C=O-CH2-C(=O)(CH3)? No, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, it's easier to think of pentane-2,4-dione as:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So that's five carbons in a row, with ketone groups on C2 and C4.

So when NaBH4 is added in excess, what happens? NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but it's usually for ketones and aldehydes. So in this case, each ketone will be reduced. So each C=O will become a CH(OH) group. So the product would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but wait: the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which has two ketone groups. So each would be reduced. So the product would be pentane-2,4-diol.

Wait, but wait, NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both ketones? Or does it have any preference? I think it would reduce both, but perhaps in a specific way.

Wait, but when you have two ketone groups, and you reduce each, you get two secondary alcohols. Now, the question is, would this product have any stereocenters?

In the starting material, each ketone is on a carbon that's connected to two CH2 groups and two CH3 groups. Wait, no: in pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone is at C2 and C4. So, for C2, it's connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and the two oxygens from the ketone. Wait, no, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So each ketone is at C2 and C4. Each of these carbons has three substituents: for C2, it's CH3, CH2 (C3), and the carbonyl. So when reduced, each becomes a CH(OH) group. So each new OH is added to a carbon that has two CH2 groups adjacent. Wait, no, let's think about the structure.

Wait, for C2: the groups are CH3 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), and the carbonyl. So when reduced, it becomes CH2(OH) attached to CH3 and CH2. Similarly for C4: the groups are CH2 (from C3), CH3 (from C5), and the carbonyl. So when reduced, each becomes CH2(OH).

So the product would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon molecule with two secondary alcohols. Now, each of these OHs is on a carbon that is connected to two CH2 groups. Let me think: the C2 and C4 would each have two CH2 groups adjacent?

Wait, no. Let me write the structure properly.

The product after reduction would be:

HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the starting structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Reducing each ketone (C=O) to a CH(OH) would give:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So each of the C2 and C4 are now CH(OH) groups. Now, each of these has two CH2 groups attached? Let me see:

- C2 is attached to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and the OH group. So the structure around C2 is CH2(OH)-CH2-CH2- etc. Wait, no, perhaps it's CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but each of these CH(OH) groups has two CH2 groups attached. So for C2, the groups are CH3, CH2 (from C3), and OH. So the C2 is connected to CH3, CH2, and OH. So each of these centers (C2 and C4) would have three different substituents: OH, CH3, and CH2CH(OH)CH3?

Wait, wait, that's not correct. Let's think about the substituents around C2:

- One substituent is CH3 (from C1)
- Another is CH2 (from C3), which is connected to another CH(OH) group
- The third is the OH group.

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused. Let me consider each carbon. For C2, after reduction, the structure is CH(OH) connected to:

- C1: CH3
- C3: CH2 (which is connected to C4: another CH(OH))
- The OH.

So the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3
- CH2CH(OH)CH3 (from C3 and beyond)
- OH

Wait, but that's not exactly right. Let me count again. The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, for C2 (the first CH(OH)):

- Two CH3 groups? No, because C1 is CH3, C3 is CH2. So C2 is connected to:

- C1: CH3
- C3: CH2
- OH

So the substituents are CH3, CH2, and OH.

Wait, but wait, CH2 is connected to what? C3 is CH2, which is connected to C4, which is another CH(OH) group. So the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3 (from C1)
- CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 (from C3 and onward)
- OH.

But wait, that's not correct because the substituents on C2 are:

- One CH3 group (from C1)
- One CH2 group (from C3)
- One OH group.

So that's three different substituents, making C2 a chiral center. Similarly, C4 is also connected to:

- CH2 (from C3)
- CH(OH) (from C2)
- CH3 (from C5)

Wait, no: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So for C4:

- Connected to C3: CH2
- Connected to C5: CH3
- And the OH group.

So substituents on C4 are:

- CH2 (from C3)
- CH3 (from C5)
- OH.

But wait, the substituents on C4 would be:

- The group from C3: which is CH2-CH(OH)-CH3
- The group from C5: which is CH3
- The OH.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each carbon's substituents.

For C2 in the product:

- Adjacent to C1: CH3
- Adjacent to C3: CH2 (which is connected to C4: another CH(OH))
- And the OH.

So the substituents are CH3, CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, and OH. But wait, CH3, CH2, and OH are all different. So C2 is a chiral center.

Similarly, for C4:

- Adjacent to C3: CH2
- Adjacent to C5: CH3
- And the OH.

So substituents are CH2, CH3, and OH. So C4 is also a chiral center.

Thus, the product of Reaction II is a diol with two chiral centers: C2 and C4.

Now, when NaBH4 is used, does it induce any specific configuration? Or is it a racemic mixture?

Wait, NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but it's not known for its enantioselectivity. So in the reduction of a symmetrical ketone, it would produce a racemic mixture. But in this case, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetrical. Because the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So the molecule is symmetrical around the central CH2. So when the two ketones are reduced, each would form a secondary alcohol, but since the molecule is symmetrical, the two OH groups would end up in the same configuration.

Wait, that's an important point. Because the molecule is symmetrical, the two ketone groups are identical. So when NaBH4 reduces each ketone, the stereochemistry of the resulting OH groups would be the same on both sides.

Wait, but wait: because the starting material is symmetrical, the product would have either both OH groups on the same side (R,R or S,S) or perhaps it's a meso compound.

Wait, let me think about this. The product is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

If the two OH groups are on the same side, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So the product would be a meso compound, which has two stereocenters but is achiral because of the plane of symmetry.

Wait, let me confirm. For a molecule with two chiral centers, if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and not chiral. So in this case, if the two OH groups are both R or both S, the molecule would be achiral because of the symmetry.

So the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, which has two stereocenters but is not chiral. So it's a single compound, giving a single peak in any HPLC, regardless of phase.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the molecule is symmetrical, and each OH is added in a certain configuration, would that result in a meso form or a pair of enantiomers?

In this case, the product would have two stereocenters, but due to the symmetry, the molecule would be a meso compound. So it would have two stereocenters but be achiral, because the two stereocenters are mirror images of each other, leading to an internal plane of symmetry.

So the product of Reaction II is a single compound, which is a meso diol. So when run on a chiral HPLC column, it would elute as a single peak because it's not chiral. On a normal-phase HPLC, it would also give a single peak because it's a single compound.

Now, going back to Reaction I. The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one after reduction.

Wait, no, the product of Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But we were trying to figure out how many stereoisomers are formed.

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. When we reduce the ketone at C3, which is two carbons away, we create a new stereocenter at C3. Since the reduction isn't stereoselective, the product at C3 would be a racemic mixture.

So the product of Reaction I is a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5, respectively.

Wait, actually, the starting material's configuration is S at C5, and the new stereocenter is at C3. So the product would be two enantiomers: one where C3 is R, and another where C3 is S. Each with C5 S.

Thus, the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

So now, combining the products from both reactions. Reaction I gives two enantiomers (two compounds) in a 1:1 ratio. Reaction II gives a single compound (meso, so one compound).

So when you combine them, you have three compounds in total: the two enantiomers from Reaction I and the single meso compound from Reaction II.

Wait, but wait: no. Because Reaction I gives a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, so that's two compounds. Reaction II gives one compound. So total of three different compounds.

Now, when these are run on a normal-phase HPLC column, which is based on polarity, each compound would separate into its own peak. So three peaks.

On a chiral HPLC column, which is used to separate enantiomers, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would each give a peak. The meso compound, being achiral, would not be separated by the chiral column and would give a single peak.

So on the chiral column: two peaks (from Reaction I) + one peak (from Reaction II) = three peaks.

On the normal-phase column: three peaks as well.

Wait, but wait. The normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity, so each compound would have its own retention time. So Reaction I gives two compounds (enantiomers), but in normal-phase, they would elute at different times because their physical properties are different. So that's two peaks. Reaction II gives one compound, so that's one peak. Total of three peaks on normal-phase.

But wait, no. Wait, the two enantiomers from Reaction I are non-superimposable mirror images. So they have different physical properties, so on a normal-phase HPLC, they would elute at different times, giving two peaks. The meso compound is a single compound, so one peak. So total three peaks on normal-phase.

Wait, but wait. The normal-phase HPLC column is not a chiral column. So in normal-phase, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would be separated because they're different compounds, leading to two peaks. The meso compound is a single compound, so one peak. So total three peaks.

But wait, let me think again. For a normal-phase HPLC, the separation is based on the interaction between the stationary phase (polar) and the analyte. Enantiomers have the same physical properties (like polarity) but are different in their structure. So in some cases, they might not be separated on a normal-phase column. But in many cases, they would be separated because their structures are different, leading to different retention times.

Wait, but wait, no. Enantiomers have the same physical properties except for their ability to rotate plane-polarized light. So in a normal HPLC, which doesn't involve chiral interactions, enantiomers may not be separated because the column doesn't distinguish between them. So in a normal-phase HPLC, which is not a chiral column, enantiomers would elute at the same time, giving a single peak. But wait, wait, no. Because the physical properties (like polarity) are the same, so the same retention time. But in reality, some normal-phase columns might separate enantiomers based on their slight differences, but it's not guaranteed. But in the context of this question, I think we can assume that on a normal-phase column, enantiomers would not be separated, so the two enantiomers from Reaction I would merge into one peak.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Let's think about this carefully.

In normal-phase HPLC (like silica), the stationary phase is polar (usually). The mobile phase is non-polar. The separation is based on the polarity of the compounds. Enantiomers have the same polarity because they're mirror images. So in a normal-phase HPLC, enantiomers would have the same retention time and thus co-elute, giving a single peak.

But wait, that's not correct. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images, but their physical properties like polarity are identical. So in a normal HPLC, they would migrate through the column in the same way, leading to a single peak. So in the normal-phase HPLC, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would be a single peak, and the meso compound from Reaction II would be another peak. So total two peaks.

Wait, but wait, the product from Reaction II is a single compound (meso), which would be a single peak. The two enantiomers from Reaction I would merge into one peak on normal-phase, so total two peaks.

But wait, earlier I thought that the normal-phase would separate enantiomers, but now I'm thinking they would not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the normal-phase HPLC would separate all three compounds: the two enantiomers and the meso, but that depends on whether the enantiomers have different enough properties to separate.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to consider that in a normal-phase HPLC, each distinct compound, regardless of its stereoisomerism, would give a separate peak. So the two enantiomers would be two separate peaks, and the meso compound would be the third. So three peaks.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me think about a simple case: if you have a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, would a normal-phase HPLC separate them? I think in most cases, no, because the column doesn't interact with the stereochemistry, so the enantiomers would have the same retention time and co-elute, giving a single peak. But sometimes, depending on the structure, they might have slightly different interactions, but that's not the case here.

So, in this case, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would co-elute on normal-phase HPLC, giving one peak. The meso compound is a different compound, so another peak. So two peaks total on normal-phase.

On the chiral HPLC, the two enantiomers from Reaction I would separate into two peaks, and the meso compound (which is achiral) would elute as a single peak. So three peaks on chiral HPLC.

Wait, but wait. The meso compound is achiral, so in a chiral column, would it elute as a single peak? Yes, because it's a single compound. The two enantiomers would elute as two separate peaks, because the chiral column can distinguish between enantiomers. So total three peaks on chiral HPLC and two on normal-phase.

But according to the options, let's see:

Option D: 3 peaks in both columns.

Option B: 3 in chiral, 2 in normal.

Wait, in this scenario, chiral would have three peaks (two from Reaction I, one from Reaction II), and normal-phase would have two (one from Reaction I's two enantiomers, one from Reaction II). So the correct answer would be B) 3 in chiral and 2 in normal.

Wait, but let me make sure. So Reaction I: two enantiomers. Reaction II: one meso compound.

Chiral HPLC: two peaks for Reaction I, one for Reaction II. So 3 peaks.

Normal-phase: one peak for Reaction I (since enantiomers co-elute), one for Reaction II. So 2 peaks.

So the answer would be B: 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase.

Looking at the options:

Option B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Yes, that matches.


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in both normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC chromatograms.

### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one
- The starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, is a chiral molecule with a ketone group at C3 and a methoxy group at C5.
- Treatment with LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at C3. The configuration at C5 remains unchanged (S).
- Since the reduction is not stereoselective, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5, respectively.
- Thus, Reaction I produces two distinct stereoisomers.

### Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione
- The starting material, pentane-2,4-dione, is a symmetrical molecule with ketone groups at C2 and C4.
- Treatment with excess NaBH4 reduces both ketones to secondary alcohols, forming a diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.
- Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the product is a meso compound. A meso compound has two stereocenters but is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.
- Thus, Reaction II produces a single compound.

### Combined Products
- Reaction I contributes two enantiomers, and Reaction II contributes one meso compound. Combining these gives three distinct compounds in total.

### Analysis of Chromatograms
1. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Chiral HPLC separates enantiomers. The two enantiomers from Reaction I will elute as two distinct peaks.
   - The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral and will elute as a single peak.
   - Total peaks in chiral HPLC: **3**.

2. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on polarity. The two enantiomers from Reaction I are non-superimposable mirror images but have identical physical properties (e.g., polarity), causing them to co-elute as a single peak.
   - The meso compound from Reaction II is a distinct compound and will elute as a separate peak.
   - Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC: **2**.

### Conclusion
- The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks** (two from the enantiomers of Reaction I and one from the meso compound of Reaction II).
- The normal-phase HPLC will show **2 peaks** (one from the co-elution of the enantiomers of Reaction I and one from the meso compound of Reaction II).
