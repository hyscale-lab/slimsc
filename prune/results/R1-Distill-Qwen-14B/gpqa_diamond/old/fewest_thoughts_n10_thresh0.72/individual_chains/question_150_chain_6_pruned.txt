Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's start by understanding what's given. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and there's a reaction sequence using three reagents. I need to figure out the structure of the starting material and then determine what the final product is from the reaction steps.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs,2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). I'll try to interpret each of these signals.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so I'm thinking maybe an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes in certain situations, like conjugation, the shift can be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton attached to an electronegative group or something. Wait, but the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets, but if it's part of some conjugated system, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylic proton adjacent to an aldehyde? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think again. Another possibility: an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde) would have the aldehyde proton as a triplet because of coupling with the adjacent vinyl protons. Oh wait, but the integration here is 1H. So maybe it's an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton with some substitution.

Wait, let's look at the other signals. 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a pair of doublets, which could be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two protons in each pair, so maybe two para-disposed substituents. Wait, but the coupling for each is 2H, so perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, like para-substituted, where each substituent has two pro
