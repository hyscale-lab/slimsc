Okay, so I've got this question about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors, right? So that would be a column vector with two elements. Maybe like (3i, 4) as the components. Or wait, sometimes they're written as a row vector, but I think for a state vector, it's a column. So the state vector here is χ = [3i, 4]^T. Or wait, no, maybe it's [4, 3i]^T? Wait, the question says (3i,4), which would be [3i, 4]^T.

The question is about the expectation value of S_y. I remember that the expectation value is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the spin operator, multiplied by the state vector again. So the formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = χ† σ_y χ. Oh wait, σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, which the question provides as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So σ_y is given.

So first, I need to write the state vector as a column vector. Let's say χ = [3i; 4], since the first component is
