Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, let me read it carefully. 

An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical approximation.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the setup. The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments will move in opposite directions to conserve momentum, which should be zero since the initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The problem gives that one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Let me denote the masses. Let’s say the less massive fragment has mass m, so the other is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is m + 2m = 3m. And this sum is 0.99 M because it's 99% of the initial mass. So 3m = 0.99 M. That gives m = 0.33 M, and 2m = 0.66 M. 

Wait, wait. Hmm, initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So the rest energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. But here, the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99 M, but wait, 99% of M in terms of mass, or energy? Oh, the problem says sum of rest-masses is 99% of initial mass M. So the masses are 3m = 0.99 M.

So m is (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M, and 2m is 0.66 M. 

But wait, the initial nucleus has rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. So Mc² = 300 GeV. The rest-mass energy of each fragment is their rest mass times c squared. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, and
