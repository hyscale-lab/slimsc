Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the Hooke's law potential, which makes sense because the force would be F = -k r, and k = m ω², so F = -m ω² r. 

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy. Oh wait, I should remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers, and for a 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. 

So first, I think I need to recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ℏω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...). But wait, actually, in three dimensions, the energy depends on the sum of the three quantum numbers. Let me think again. Oh right, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ℏω, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. Alternatively, another way to express the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ℏω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy levels are quantized in steps determined by the total quantum number n.

Wait, but the third excited state—how does that translate to the value of n? The ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0. The first excited state is n=1, second excited is n=2, third excited is n=3. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait no, the ground state is the zeroth excited state, first excited state is the first one above that. So the ground state is n=0, first excited n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So the third excited state is for n=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ℏω = (9/2) ℏω. So that's the energy part.
