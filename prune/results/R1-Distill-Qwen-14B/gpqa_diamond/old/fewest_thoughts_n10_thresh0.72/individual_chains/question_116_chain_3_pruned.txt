Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound D is. Let's take it step by step.

First, the question starts with compound A. Its proton NMR has two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting helps determine the structure. So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H suggests maybe two equivalent CH3 groups. Because 6 hydrogens divided by 3 in a triplet would mean each group has 3 H, so two CH3 groups. Wait, but two CH3 groups would give a triplet if they're each split by another group. Hmm.

And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet implies each proton is split into four, so each of those 4H is next to a group with 3H. Wait, 4H as a quartet. So perhaps a CH2 group next to another CH2, maybe? Or maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH. Let me think. For a quartet, the neighboring group has 3 H (n+1 where n=3, so quartet). So if I have a CH2 next to a CH2CH3, perhaps?

Wait, so let me think of a structure where there's a CH2CH3 group. Because if I have two CH3 groups and a CH2CH2 group, but wait, maybe it's a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Let me think about diethyl ether. Wait, diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups connected by an oxygen. But the NMR for diethyl ether shows a quartet for the CH2 near the oxygen, and a triplet for the CH3. Wait, that might fit. But wait, in diethyl ether, the CH2 adjacent to oxygen is split into a quartet because it's next to the CH3, which has 3 H. Each CH2 would split into a quartet, and the CH3 into a triplet. So for diethyl ether, the NMR would have a quartet around 1.2 ppm (for the CH2 near O) integrating to 4H, and a triplet around 0.9 ppm for the CH3
