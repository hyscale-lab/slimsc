Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, the question says a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of these stars meet that condition.

I remember that the S/N ratio depends on the brightness of the star, the exposure time, and the instrument's capabilities. ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph on the VLT, which I think is pretty powerful. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

Looking at the options, there are six stars labeled a) to f). Let me go through each one.

Option a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star. It's one of the brightest in the sky. So it should be easily detectable. Because bright stars have high S/N.

Option b) Polaris. Also a bright star, right? It's the North Star and quite visible. So probably detectable too.

Options c to f are all stars with the same absolute V magnitude of 15 mag, but different distances. Absolute magnitude is how bright they are intrinsically, but their apparent magnitude (how bright they appear from Earth) depends on the distance. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. 

Wait, since M is 15, let's calculate their apparent magnitudes.

c) 10 pc: m =15 +5*(log10(10/10))=15 +5*(0)=15. So apparent mag is 15. That's pretty faint. I don't think that's detectable. Because ground-based telescopes can't see stars below about magnitude 20 in some cases, but ESPRESSO is on VLT, which is big. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact limit.

Wait, no, the VLT is a big telescope with a large mirror, so perhaps it can detect fainter stars. How does the S/N relate to apparent magnitude?

I think the S/N improves with the square root of the exposure time, but here the exposure is fixed at 1 hour. But more importantly, the S/N depends on the flux from the star. Flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), where m is apparent magnitude. So higher m (fainter) means lower flux, so lower S/N.

ESPRESSO's S/N per pixel depends on the star's brightness. I think the formula for S/N is S/N = (flux) * sqrt(exposure time) / noise per unit time. But I might be getting that wrong.

Alternatively, I remember a rule of thumb: for a given instrument, S/N increases with the square root of the exposure time and the square root of the number of photons. So for a star with higher apparent brightness (lower m), you'll get more photons, leading to higher S/N.

But the question is about whether the S/N is at least
