Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity is when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens if the compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. But wait, are there other possibilities? I remember that some compounds can be optically active without chiral centers, like if they have a plane of symmetry or something else. No, wait, no—chiral centers are the main thing. So each compound needs to be checked for chiral centers or perhaps some other factors.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to find out how many are optically active. Let me go through each one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's draw the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a Cl, a CH2CH3 (since 2-methyl), and two substituents. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methyl. So, structure is Cl—C(R)=CH2, where R is CH(CH3) maybe? Wait, no, it's 2-methyl, so perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1: Cl, C2: CH(CH3), but the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH
