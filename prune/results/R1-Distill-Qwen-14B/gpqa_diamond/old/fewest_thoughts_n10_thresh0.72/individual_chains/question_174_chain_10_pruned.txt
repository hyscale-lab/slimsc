Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy differences between relativistic and classical calculations. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest. When it splits, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So let's denote the two fragments as fragment A and fragment B. Let's say fragment A is the more massive one, so it's twice the mass of fragment B. Oh wait, the problem says one fragment is twice the other in terms of rest mass. So if I let the smaller fragment have mass m, the larger is 2m. Then the total rest mass would be m + 2m = 3m. But wait, the problem says the sum is 99% of M, so 3m = 0.99M. So m = 0.99M /3 = 0.33M.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get that right. The initial nucleus has mass M. After fission, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 0.99 M. So 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So fragment B is m = 0.33 M, fragment A is 2m= 0.66 M. So masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

Wait, but actually, the statement says "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M." So the total rest mass is 0.99 M. So each fragment's rest mass is 2:1 ratio. So fragment A is 2/3 of 0.99 M, fragment B is 1/3 of 0.99 M.

So fragment A's rest mass is (2/3)*0.99 M = 0.66 M, fragment B is 0.33 M. Got it.

Now, since the nucleus was at rest, the momentum of A and B must be equal and opposite. So p_A = p_B in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So, for each fragment, the momentum p is given by gamma*m*v, but considering they are moving at relativistic speeds, we can't ignore relativistic effects, which is why the problem is asking about the difference between relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations.

Wait, but the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. So T1 is the kinetic energy of fragment A (since it's more massive, being 0.66 M).

In the classical approximation, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But relativistically, it's (gamma - 1) m c².

So we'll need to find the velocities or the gamma factors of the two fragments.

Since momentum is conserved, and the system is initially at rest, the total momentum after must be zero. So p_A = -p_B → their magnitudes are equal.

Momentum for each fragment is p = gamma * m * v.

So for fragment A: p = gamma_A * m_A * v_A

Fragment B: p = gamma_B * m_B * v_B

But
