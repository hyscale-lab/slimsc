Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, I think I should start by recalling what each of these symmetries mean. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is bigger; it combines Lorentz symmetry with translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz, right? Or is it the other way around? No, wait, Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincare because Poincare includes translations and Lorentz. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, which would imply they must also respect Lorentz.

But wait, SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare? Since Poincare includes momentum translation, SMEFT operators should also respect that because they're part of a relativistic theory. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for charge conjugation and parity. SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. Because the Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry (except in some specific cases), right? Wait, no, the Standard Model has
