Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in these transitions, the electron emits or absorbs a photon, which is a dipole transition, so it's governed by the selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for dipole transitions in hydrogen, the selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but usually, considering it's a two-step process here, each step probably changes by ±1. Oh wait, no, wait—the transition can have a Δn of up to 2 if it's a two-photon process, but the question says it's via two dipole transitions, so each transition is a single photon change.

But wait, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It decays to n=1, l=0, m=0. So over two steps, it goes from 3 to 1. That could be 3→2→1, right? So each step would change n by 1.

Now, the selection rules for l: Δl = ±1, and for m, Δm = 0, ±1. But since the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), what are the possible transitions? For the first transition, from l=0 to l', the only allowed is l' = 1 because Δl can only be
