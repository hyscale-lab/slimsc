Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm^-1. The broad peak around 3000 probably indicates an O-H stretch, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an -OH group, like in an alcohol or maybe a phenol. But another thing, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broader and maybe around 2500-3300, but also maybe a strong absorption. But the question says it's very broad, which makes me think of either an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But let's not get stuck here yet.

The other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700, which might suggest something else. Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or an amide? Hmm. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl at 1700, maybe it's an ester. Also, esters have two carbonyls? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Oh wait, wait, another thought: maybe the 1700 is a ketone or ester, and the 1650 is an aromatic C=C stretch? Because aromatic rings typically have peaks around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is on the higher end, maybe indicating some conjugation or substituents.

Now moving to the 1H NMR. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene or aromatic ring. So the
