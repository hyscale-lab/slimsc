Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

The question says there are two parts, A and B. Let me break them down.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a neighboring atom between two positions, resulting in a different structure. Like in ketones and aldehydes, or in enols and ketones. Tautomerism usually involves the movement of a hydrogen and the shift of a double bond. For example, in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups, like diketones.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, right? Quinones have two ketone groups. So benzoquinone is something like O=C6H4=C=O, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure. Wait, benzoquinone could be 1,4-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, the structure would have two ketones. Now, can it undergo tautomerism? I'm not so sure. Tautomerism typically requires adjacent carbonyl groups because the hydrogen can transfer between the alpha carbons. If the two carbonyls are not adjacent, maybe tautomerism isn't possible. So in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are on opposite ends of the ring, not adjacent. So maybe it doesn't show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring. So they are at positions 1,3,5, which are every other position. Wait, that makes them adjacent? No, wait, on a cyclohexane ring, positions 1,3,5 are each separated by a single carbon. So the positions are 1,
