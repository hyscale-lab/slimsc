Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And there's an observable represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has certain elements. The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of that operator. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the absolute value of the amplitude associated with that eigenvalue.

So, the first step is probably to find the eigenvalues of matrix P because those are the possible outcomes when measuring the observable. Then, since the question asks for the probability of getting 0, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and compute the probability based on the state vector given.

Wait, let me make sure about the steps. The process is: find the eigenvalues of P. Then, for each eigenvalue, find the eigenvectors. The state vector is given, which I'll call |ψ>. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue λ is the sum of the squares of the amplitudes of the components of |ψ> in the eigenspace of λ.

But wait, in this case, since P is a 3x3 matrix, the state vector is a 3x1 column, so it's a vector in a three-dimensional space. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Wait, but let me look at matrix P again. It's given as:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

So, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, okay. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me compute the determinant of (P - λ I). The matrix becomes:

[-λ, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -λ]

So the determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
      - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ]
      + 0 [ ... ] 

Wait, maybe expanding along the first row is manageable. The determinant would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
     - (1/√2) *
