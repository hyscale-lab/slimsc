Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, wait a second. I think I've seen something like this before. Oh right! I remember that when a density matrix is a mixture of the identity matrices, it represents a completely mixed state. So this ρ is a completely mixed state for a qubit.

Wait, but what does that mean in terms of its position in the qubits space? The options are points in 3D space, so each option is a coordinate (x, y, z). I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of the state space of a qubit. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a pure state, and the completely mixed state is at the origin, right?

But wait, how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector? I think the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector with components (x, y, z). So when r is zero, the density matrix becomes (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which is exactly the given ρ here.
