Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. Hmm, I'll need to figure out the structure of each compound step by step.

First, let's read the reaction scheme carefully.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Then there are some hints. Hint a) says that when compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, right? So, compound A must have a carbonyl group because Wittig reactions form alkenes from aldehydes or ketones.

So compound A is possibly a ketone. Because in a Wittig reaction, the ylide (which is the phosphorous reagent) reacts with a carbonyl group to form an alkene. The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure mentally.

The main ring is cyclopentane. At position 4, there's a substituent which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)= group, right? Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)= but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)2C=CH2? No, wait, actually, it's the ylid part. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the structure where a CH2 group is attached to a carbon with a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The product after Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and at position 4, a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would look like CH2-C(CH2?), wait no. Wait, propan-2-yl is (CH2)2CH3, but as a ylid, I think it's (CH3)2P=CHCH2-? Or wait, the structure is (CH2)2CH2 with the double bond. Hmm, maybe I should think about the Wittig reaction. The ylide would have a structure like Ph3P=CH-R, where R is some group. When it reacts with a carbonyl, it forms an alkene.

In this case, the product has the substituent at position 4 as propan-2-ylidene, which is a CH2-C
