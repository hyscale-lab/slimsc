Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I really need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down. The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with some element Y. There are five such compounds, right? So Y is some element that forms five different compounds with F.

The problem gives me several clues about substances A1 through A5. Let me go through each clue one by one and see if I can piece together what each substance is.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction is something like A1 → A2 + F2. The oF (I think that's the atomic fraction or maybe oxygen-free, but more likely it's the oxidation state) for A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oF probably stands for the oxidation state of fluorine in A2. Because 31.96% is close to 1/3 (which is 33.33%), maybe the oxidation state is +1/3? Hmm, but fluorine usually has a -1 oxidation state. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, maybe oF is the oxygen-free equivalent—no, probably not. Maybe oF stands for the oxidation state of F in A2. So 31.96% is approximately 1/3. So if F has an oxidation state of +1/3 in A2, that's unusual because F is usually -1. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I should think about fluorine's oxidation state in A2. So A2 is a compound of Y and F. If the oxidation state of F in A2 is 31.96%, that's roughly 32%, which is close to 1/3. So maybe F has an oxidation state of +1/3 in A2. But that's odd because fluorine is typically more electronegative and usually has a -1 oxidation state. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps oF refers to the "oxygen-free" equivalent, but that's probably not it. Alternatively, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine in the compound. Oh, wait, that makes more sense. So if A2 has 3
