Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about gene interactions contributing to resistance in white lupine against anthracnose. They've done knock-out mutants and double mutants, and the resistance levels are given. The key point is that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others.

So, the data is:

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% (so no resistance, meaning it's completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (so halfway resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, I'm thinking about epistasis here. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if two mutations together have a certain effect, we can infer something about their interaction.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0%, same as g2. Hmm. So when g2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, regardless of g1. That suggests that g2 is epistatic to g1, meaning that g2 is downstream of g1. Because even if you have a mutation in g1, the absence of g2 (which is downstream) causes no resistance. So g2 is epistatic to g1.

Wait, or the other way around? Let me think. Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So if in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as one of the single mutants, it suggests that gene is epistatic. So g1g2 has the same resistance as g2, which is 0%. So the presence of the g2 mutation is epistatic over g1. So g2 is epistatic to g1. That would mean that g2 is downstream of g1, because the pathway is g1 -> g2 -> ... So if g2 is knocked out, it doesn't matter if g1 is working or not; the pathway is blocked.

Similarly, looking at the other double mutants:

g1g3: 10% (much lower than either g1 or g3). Hmm, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and together it's 10%. So their combined effect is worse, but not as bad as g2's. So maybe they are in the same pathway but not the same as g2.

g2g3: 0% same as g2. So again, the resistance is as bad as g2. So the presence of g2 mutation masks anything g3 is doing. So g2 is epistatic to g3 as well.

Now, the question mentions that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. Let's see. If the transcription factor is upstream, knocking it out would mean that downstream genes aren't expressed. So, if a gene is a transcription factor, and it's upstream,
