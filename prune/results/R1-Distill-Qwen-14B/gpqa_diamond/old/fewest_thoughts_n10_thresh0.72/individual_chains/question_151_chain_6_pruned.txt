Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm. Let me read it again. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable P is represented by a 3x3 matrix. I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0.

Wait, quantum mechanics, right. Observables are represented by operators, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. So first, I should find the eigenvalues of P because the possible measurement outcomes are those eigenvalues.

The matrix P is given. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me write that out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Eigenvalues come from the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Let me set that up.

The matrix (P - λI) would be:

[
[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

Now, the determinant of this matrix should be zero. Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tricky. Let's write it out:

| -λ    1/√2    0   |
|1/√2  -λ    1/√2  |
| 0     1/√2  -λ   |

The determinant calculation goes like this:

-λ * [ (-λ)*(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- 1/√2 * [ (1/√2)*(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, no. The cofactor expansion along the first row.

So, each element multiplied by its minor.

First term: (-λ) * determinant of the minor matrix, which is the 2x2 matrix when first row and column are removed. That minor is:

[
[-λ, 1/√2],
[1/√2, -λ]
]

The determinant of that is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2).

Second term: (1/√2) * determinant of the minor. The minor for the second element is the matrix with first row and second column removed:

[
[1/√2, 1/√2],
[0, -λ]
]

Wait, no. Let me think again. The minor when removing row 1 and column 2 is the 2x2 matrix:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So, rows 2 and 3: columns 1 and 3.

So for row 1, column 2, the minor is:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, -λ]

So the minor matrix is:
[
[1/√2, 1/√2],
[0, -λ]
]

The determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/(√2).

But since we're expanding along the first row, the sign alternates as + - + for each element. So the second term is -(1/√2) * [ -λ/√2 ] ?

Wait, the cofactor expansion formula: each term is element * (-1)^(i+j) * minor determinant. For the first row (i=1), j=2: sign is (-1)^(1+2) = -1.

So the second term is (1/√2) * (-1)^(1+2) * [ determinant
