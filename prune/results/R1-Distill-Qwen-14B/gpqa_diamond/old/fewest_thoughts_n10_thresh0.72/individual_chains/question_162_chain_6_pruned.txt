Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So this is a 2D spacetime or maybe a surface in some manifold.

The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, how does that relate to the metric provided?

Let me recall. The metric given is in two dimensions, so it's a 2D surface. The area element in a metric like this would be the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. Or wait, actually, for a 2D metric, the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor.

So first, I should write the metric in matrix form. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). That means the metric tensor g has components g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_xy = g_yx = 0. So the determinant of g is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) - 0 = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Wait, no, the metric tensor for 2D is a 2x2 matrix. Since it's diagonal, the determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy is zero, the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

So sqrt(det g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, that's the area element for this metric. Now, what's the region over which we're integrating? The denominator 4 - x² - y² suggests that the metric is defined where 4 - x² - y² > 0, because otherwise we'd have a negative or division by zero. So the domain is x² + y² < 4, which is a disk of radius 2. Because 4 is 2 squared.

So to find the area, I need to integrate the area element over all x and y such that x² + y² < 4. So the area A is the double integral over x and y (within x² + y² <4) of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, this integral might be easier in polar coordinates. Let me switch to polar coordinates, where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So substituting into the integral, the denominator becomes 4 - r². The area element becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π)
