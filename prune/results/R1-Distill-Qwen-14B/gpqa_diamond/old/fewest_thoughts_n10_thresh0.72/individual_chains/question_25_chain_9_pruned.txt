Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about name reactions, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts, each involving a name reaction. I need to figure out the reactants A and B for each reaction given the products. There are four options to choose from, labeled A to D. Each option gives possible A and B values.

First, let's break down each reaction separately.

**Reaction 1: A + H2SO4 â†’ 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one**

I know that H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is a strong acid and a common acid catalyst. When alcohols react with sulfuric acid, especially in certain conditions, it can lead to dehydration reactions, forming alkenes or ketones. But wait, the product here is a ketone. Oh, right, if the alcohol is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, dehydration might not be the main pathway. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another possibility is that A is a diol, and H2SO4 is causing some kind of cyclization. Because the product is a spiro compound, that suggests a bicyclic structure where two rings are connected by a single atom. Spiro compounds often form through acid-catalyzed cyclizations, especially from diols or other structures with adjacent functional groups.

So, thinking about the product: 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one. The 'spiro[4.5]' indicates that the spiro atom is connected to two rings, one with 4 carbons and another with 5 carbons. The ketone is at position 6. So perhaps the starting material A is a diol, and under acidic conditions, it undergoes a cyclization to form the spiro structure and a ketone.

Wait, but how does a diol become a ketone upon acid treatment? Oh, maybe the diol is a vicinal diol, and the
