Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that entropy is related to the area of the event horizon for a black hole, thanks to the work of people like Hawking and Bekenstein. The formula I think is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is Newton's constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. Or wait, maybe I should double-check that formula. Oh right, yes, I think it's S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * (k_B), where l_p is the Planck length. But maybe I should just get the formula right.

But wait, the question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, which for a black hole is the Schwarzschild radius, R = 2 G M / c². Alternatively, the area A would then be 4 π R² = 4 π (2 G M / c²)^2. But maybe it's easier to find the radius from the angular size and distance.

Given that the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs, and θ is 10^-17 degrees. Oh, wait, θ is given in degrees, but I need to convert that to radians to use it in calculations. Because the formula for angular size is θ ≈ (R/d), when R << d, which I think applies here since d is 1e10 parsecs and the event horizon is probably much smaller.

So, first step: convert θ from degrees to radians. θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). Let's calculate that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1e-17 * 1.745e-2 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Assuming that θ ≈ R/d, where R is the radius of the event horizon, then R = θ * d. So R = θ_rad * d.

Wait, but d is given in parsecs. I should convert that to meters because all the constants are in SI units. 1
