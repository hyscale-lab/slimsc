Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given a state that's an eigenstate of P_x. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the setup is that the system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the question is asking for the uncertainty ΔP_z.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩². So I'll need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, the state is a vector in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. That probably means the basis is orthonormal, so I can work directly with the components without worrying about transformations. That's good.

So, let's denote the state as |ψ⟩. The components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), so I'll write that as a column vector:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 ]
        [ 1/√2 ]
        [ -1/2 ]

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute the expectation value. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of the components multiplied by their corresponding diagonal elements.

Looking at the P_z matrix, it's diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is:

⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ = ( (-1/2) * ħ ) + ( (1/√2) * 0 ) + ( (-1/2) * (-ħ) )

Calculating that:

= (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2) = 0. Oh, interesting, it cancels out.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The first component is (-1/2) multiplied by ħ, the (1/√2) is multiplied by 0, and the last term is (-1/2) multiplied by (-ħ), which is ħ/2. So yes,  -ħ/2 + 0 + ħ/2 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will also be diagonal, with each diagonal element squared. So P_z² has entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2. That is, (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ is:

( (-1/2)^2 * ħ² ) + ( (1/√2)^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * ħ² )

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/4) * ħ²
Second term: 0
Third term: (1/4) * ħ²
Total: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ
