Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in a reaction called the hydroboration-oxidation, but wait, no, isn't that with BH3 and then something else? Wait, no, when it's red phosphorus and HI, that's for the oxymercuration reaction. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another possibility is the cleavage of double bonds. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI can be used to cleave alkenes. The reaction is called the Wurtz reaction? Or wait, no, Wurtz is with sodium and an ether. Cleavage with HI and red phosphorus... I think that's for eliminating vicinal dihalides. Wait, no, maybe it's used to add across double bonds. Oh wait, I'm confusing reactions. Another thought: when alkenes react with HI in presence of red phosphorus, it's a way to produce the corresponding diiodide. Or maybe it's for the elimination of water or something else. Alternatively, could it be a dehydrohalogenation? Hmm, perhaps I should think about the starting material.

Looking at the spectroscopic data for Compound X. Let's start with the IR. The IR shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad
