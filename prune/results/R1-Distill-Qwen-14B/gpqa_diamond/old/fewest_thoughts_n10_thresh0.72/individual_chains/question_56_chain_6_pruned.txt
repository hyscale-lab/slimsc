Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition states. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a 3,0,0 state decaying to a 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, transitions between energy levels are governed by the selection rules.

Wait, selection rules... right, for dipole transitions, the changes in the quantum numbers are usually delta l = ±1 and delta m = 0, ±1. Also, n has to change by at least 1, but in this case it's going from n=3 to n=1, which is a change of -2. So it can't do it in one step, must go via an intermediate state.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final is |1,0,0⟩. So the first transition must be from 3 to some state, then from that state to 1.

Let me break it down. The initial state has l=0, so after the first transition, l can be 1 because delta l is ±1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. So in the first step, n goes from 3 to some n', l goes from 0 to 1. So possible n' could be 2 or 4? But wait, n has to be higher or lower? Since it's a decay, it should go to a lower energy state, so n' must be 2 because 4 is higher than 3, which isn't likely for a decay.

So the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Then the second transition takes 2,1,m to 1,0,0. So for the second transition, n changes from 2 to 1, which is a delta n of -1. The l goes from 1 to 0, which fits delta l of -1. For the m, delta m would be from m to 0. So m must change by 0, ±1. So possible m in the intermediate state must be such that m ±1 or 0 gives 0. So if the intermediate m is 1, then delta m would be -1 to get to 0. Or if m is -1, delta m would be +1. Or if m is 0, delta m is 0.
