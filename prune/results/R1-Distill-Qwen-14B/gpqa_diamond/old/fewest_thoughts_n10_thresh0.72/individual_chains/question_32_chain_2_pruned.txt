Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. The question says it's Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and typically 4 neutrons (since the most common isotope is Li-7). But here, it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that would make it Li-6. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, Li has atomic number 3. So if it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons, that's Li-6, yeah. So the nucleus X is a Li-6 nucleus.

So, I need to calculate the energy of the RHIC when this Li-6 nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The options are given in GeV, so the answer must be in billions of electron volts.

I remember that relativistic energy calculations involve the Lorentz factor gamma. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0cÂ². But wait, wait, the question is about the kinetic energy or the total energy? The problem statement says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." I think in this context, the RHIC provides the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Or perhaps the total energy
