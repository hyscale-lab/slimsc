Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The information given comes from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Ester groups have a characteristic absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹, right? So that's a clue that the compound has an ester functional group, which is O-C-O. Ester groups are usually derived from carboxylic acids and alcohols.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me break down what each of these signals might represent.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents will influence the neighboring protons. In a para-substituted benzene, the two sets of aromatic protons would be as two doublets, each integrating for two protons. Or maybe one is a triplet and the other is a doublet? Wait, no, for para substitution, the ring has two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet. But in some cases, if the substituents are in a meta or ortho arrangement, the splitting could be different. But wait, the problem says it's di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. However, the exact positions might affect the NMR signals.

Wait, but the aromatic signals are two, so maybe it's a 1,2-disubstitution (ortho) or 1,3 (meta), or 1,4 (para). But para would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet. Ortho would have maybe different coupling. But in any case, for a di-substituted benzene, the number of distinct aromatic protons can vary based on substitution. But in this case, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H, which probably implies two sets of equivalent protons. So maybe it's a para substitution, because then each set is two protons, and each set is equivalent, leading to two signals.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents are in a para position, the ring has two equivalent sets
