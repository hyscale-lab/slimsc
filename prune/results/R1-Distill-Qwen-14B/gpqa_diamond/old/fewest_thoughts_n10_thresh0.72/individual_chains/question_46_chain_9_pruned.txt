Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, right?

First, I should probably draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₂CH3?) Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Oh right, the pentene chain has five carbons, with a double bond at the first position. And there's a methyl group on carbon 3.

So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count. The parent chain is pentene, so five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, a methyl group is on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, no, if it's pent-1-ene, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the third carbon is CH(CH3), so the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because the chain would be longer. Wait, maybe the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH2CH3)? No, that would be a longer chain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. The parent chain is pentene, so 5 carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituent is a methyl group on C3. So:

Carbon 1: CH₂-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH₂
Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, that would be six carbons. Oh wait, no. Let me number the carbons.

Carbon 1: CH₂-
Carbon 2: CH-
Connected by double bond: so between 1 and 2.
Then, Carbon 3 is CH(CH3), but wait, the chain is pentane. So perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons: 1,2,3,4,5. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, no,
