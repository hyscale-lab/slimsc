Okay, so I've got this problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, first, I should recall the basics. The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n² pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And E is defined as E = pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each energy level E_n is just n² * E. That simplifies things because I can express everything in terms of E.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're fermions, each quantum state can hold at most two particles (because spin can be up or down). So in the ground state, the lowest energy levels will be filled up with as many particles as possible.

So for four particles, let's think about how they fill the states. The ground state will have the lowest possible energy levels filled with two particles each, but wait, each energy level can hold two particles because of spin. So let me list the energy levels.

The energy levels for a single particle are E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4, etc. Each of these can hold two particles because of the two possible spin states.

But since we have four particles, we'll fill the lowest energy levels until we have four particles. Let's see:

- E_1 can hold 2 particles.
- E_2 can hold another 2. So that's 4 particles in total.

So the ground state configuration is that the first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) are filled, each with two particles. So the total energy for the ground state is the sum of each particle's energy. But wait, all four particles are in the lowest two levels.

Wait, no. Each particle's energy is according to their n. So two particles are in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, that can't be right because E_1 is 1² E = E, E_2 is 2² E =4E. So two particles in E_1 contribute 2E, two in E_2 contribute 8E. So total

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The answer options are given in terms of E, where E is defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²). 

Wait, right, each particle is spin-1/2, so that's like electrons or something similar. Oh, but wait, the potential well is one-dimensional. So each particle is confined in a 1D box. 

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by the formula E_n = (n²) * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? So E_n = n² E, where E is as given. 

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. Since they are in a 1D box, the quantum number is just n. Oh wait, but wait, each particle has a spin quantum number too, which can be +1/2 or -1/2.

So, each state in the well is characterized by n and s, where s is the spin. But in a 1D box, the spatial part is
