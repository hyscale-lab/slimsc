Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum field theory problem. The question is about finding the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ in a given Lagrangian and determining whether the theory is renormalizable. Let me think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian is given as L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], which are the gamma matrices. F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor, usually for a gauge field like electromagnetism or non-Abelian fields, but here I think it's the electromagnetic tensor because it's written as F^{mu nu}.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should determine the mass dimensions of each field in the Lagrangian term and then figure out what dimension κ must have for the term to be dimensionless (since in natural units, the action is dimensionless, and each term in the Lagrangian must have the same dimension as the volume measure d^4x, which is [Mass]^−4).

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields involved. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. For F^{mu nu}, which is the field strength tensor of a gauge field, say A_mu, each F is a derivative of A, so each F has dimension 1. Because the gauge field A_mu has dimension 1, since it's like a vector potential, and derivatives have dimension 1. So F^{mu nu}, being ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, has dimension [∂][A] = (1)(1) = 1.

Now, let's break down each part of the Lagrangian term. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me compute the dimension of each part.

The σ_{mu nu} is a product of gamma matrices and their commutator. But gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ would have the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, because σ is just a coefficient here. The dimension of ψ̄ ψ is [ψ]^2. Since [ψ] is 3/2, [ψ]^2 is 3. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3.

Then we have F^{mu nu} which is dimension 1. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F is 3 + 1 = 4.

The entire term is κ multiplied by this product. Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 (because the action is dimensionless and integrated over d^4x which is dimension -4), the term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So:

κ * [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4.

But [ψ̄ σ ψ F] is 4, so κ must have dimension 0? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let's see: The term κ (ψ̄ σ ψ) F has to have dimension 4. The part (ψ̄ σ ψ) F has dimension (3) * (1) = 4. So the product is 4. Therefore, κ must be dimensionless because 4 = κ^ [ ] * 4. So κ would have to be dimensionless? But that can't be right because the options don't have that. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, no. Let me check again. Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ must have dimension 4. Let me compute the dimensions of each part:

- ψ̄ has dimension [ψ]^* which is 3/2.
- σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless.
- ψ has dimension 3/2.
- F^{mu nu} has dimension 1.

So, the product ψ̄ σ ψ F: (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4.

So the product has dimension 4. Therefore, κ must have dimension 0 because 4 = κ^d * 4 → d=0. So κ is dimensionless. But none of the options say that. Wait, the options are A-D, and the options give [κ] as either -1 or 1. Hmm. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the dimensions of F. Let me think again. The field strength tensor F_{mu nu} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. A_mu is a gauge field, which in 4 dimensions has dimension 1. So each derivative adds 1 dimension. So F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no. A_mu has dimension 1, ∂ is dimension 1, so each term in F is [∂][A] = (1)(1) = 1, so F has dimension 1. Wait, that can't be right because F is like the field tensor, which in electromagnetism is the derivative of A, so F has dimension 2? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think: the gauge field A_mu has the same dimension as the spacetime gradient ∂_mu. Because the kinetic term for A is like F^2, which is (∂A)^2. The term F_{mu nu} F^{mu nu} must have dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian density (which is dimension 4). So F^2 has dimension 4. Therefore, F has dimension 2. Because [F]^2 =4 → [F]=2. Oh, that's right! I had it wrong earlier. So F^{mu nu} has mass dimension 2.

So let me recalculate. Each F has dimension 2.

Now, the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The dimensions:

ψ̄ has 3/2, ψ has 3/2, F has 2.

So (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = (3) + 2 = 5.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5. But since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, κ has to make the whole term dimension 4. So:

κ × (5) =4 → [κ] =4-5 = -1.

Oh, okay. So κ has dimension -1. So that part is option A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? Well, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥0. Because, in general, a coupling with negative mass dimension would lead to a non-renormalizable interaction (since higher-dimension operators have higher negative dimensions for the coupling).

Wait, more accurately, the renormalizability is determined by the dimension of the coupling. For a term in the Lagrangian, each coupling constant
