Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but I'll think through each part step by step.

The question has three reactions, each leading to a product A, B, or C. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct for each.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. The product is A.

Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements often involve the movement of a sigma bond. The Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples. But wait, the first reactant is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure would be like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Oh wait, no, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Or maybe I should draw it: the amine is on a carbon that's attached to two methoxy groups. So structure-wise, it's something like CH2(OCH2CH3)2NH2? Or wait, wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So it's (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no, wait. Ethan-1-amine is CH2NH2CH3? No, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon of ethanamine. So the structure is CH2(OCH3)2NH2. So it's like (CH3O)2CH-NH2.

When this reacts with but-3-en-2-ol (which is (CH2CH2)CH-OH?), wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no. Butene is four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait: the structure is CH2CH2? Let me think. But-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, numbering from the other end. Alternatively, but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4, but butane only has four carbons, so numbering from the first end, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, let me write the structure properly. For but-3-en-2-ol, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but butane is four carbons, so the double bond is at the end. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol is HO-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3, and the hydroxyl on C2. So structure is CH2(OH)C=CH2. Wait, maybe not. Let me count. Butane is four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-2-ol has a double bond between 3 and 4 and a hydroxyl on 2. So structure would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, that's five carbons. Wait, but butane is four, so
