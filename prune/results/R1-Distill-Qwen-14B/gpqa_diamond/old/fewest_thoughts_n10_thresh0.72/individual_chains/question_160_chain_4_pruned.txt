Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark spots called the diffraction pattern. The shape of the aperture affects the pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles, but this is a polygon with N sides and N going to infinity. Oh wait, if N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides would approximate a circle.

But wait, the problem says the apothems are all the same length 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So if N is very large, the shape becomes a circle with radius 'a'? Or wait, no. Because for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius (the distance from center to a vertex) as a = R * cos(π/N). But as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1. So the apothem 'a' would approach the radius R of the circle. So in the limit, the aperture becomes a circle with radius 'a'. 

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem. So the aperture's radius is 'a'.

So the problem reduces to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. But wait, no. Because the original problem is about a polygon, but when N becomes very large, it's a circle. So the problem becomes similar to the single-slit diffraction but for a circular aperture. Or wait, no, the single slit is a rectangular aperture, but here it's a circular one.

Wait, no. The single-slit diffraction formula applies to a slit of width 'd', but for a circular aperture, the pattern is different. The central maximum is broader and there are rings (like an Airy pattern). But the question is about the minima. In the case of a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at a certain angle. But wait, the question says it's a polygon with N sides, not a circle, but when N is very large... So probably, the problem is approximating to the case of a circular aperture.

Wait, no. Wait, the apothems are all the same length. For a regular polygon, all apothems are same. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon is a circle with radius equal to the apothem? Or wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the radius (the distance from center to a vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches 'a'. So the polygon becomes a circle of radius 'a' when N is very large. So the problem is effectively about a circular aperture of radius 'a'.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says it's an N-sided polygon
