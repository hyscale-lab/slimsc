Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. Their 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Wait, C10H14... Let me think about the possible structures. For benzene derivatives, each substituent usually adds a certain number of hydrogens. Benzene itself is C6H6. So if we have C10H14, that's 4 more carbons and 8 more hydrogens than benzene. But wait, no: C6H6 has 6 carbons and 6 H, so C10H14 is 4 more carbons and 8 more H. So each substituent adds a certain number of H. For example, a methyl group is -CH3, which adds 3 H per substituent. But if there are multiple substituents, that changes things.

Wait, wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to confirm it's aromatic. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, here: (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees: one from benzene (three double bonds equivalent) and another from a ring, but wait. Wait, benzene is three DoU (one ring and three double bonds). So 3 DoU from benzene, and the rest is one more DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond. Hmm, but for a compound like toluene, it's C7H8, which has DoU of (2*7+2-8)/2= (16-8)/2=4. So yeah, same as here. So our compound has a benzene ring
