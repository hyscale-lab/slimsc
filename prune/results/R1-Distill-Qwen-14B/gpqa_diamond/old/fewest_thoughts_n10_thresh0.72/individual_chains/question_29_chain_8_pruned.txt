Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound in barley. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene. They used EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the mutants. I need to figure out which mutation is likely to stop the compound from being made.

First, let's understand the setup. The gene has five exons and four introns. The sequencing found changes in the first exon area of the target gene. So, the mutations are in the first exon.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the sequence. I think I need to look for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. That could be a frameshift, a premature stop codon, or a significant change in the protein structure.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene: The fourth nucleotide changes from T to C (so TTT becomes TTC). So in the first exon, position 4: T→C. Then, looking a bit further, maybe position 22? Let me see: the sequence after that—CGCTGG becomes CGCTGG (same?), wait, no, the intact gene has CGCTGG, and mutant 1 has CGCTGG as well. Wait, perhaps the first change is TTT→TCT. So, maybe a point mutation. Let me see what that does. The first exon starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So, the next codon is TTT, which is phenylalanine. In mutant 1, it's changed to TCT, which is serine. So, a conservative substitution? Not a big effect perhaps. No frameshift here because the change is a single nucleotide substitution, and the reading frame remains the same. So no frameshift, just an amino acid change. So this might not disrupt the protein enough to stop the compound.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene: The first part is ATGTTCTAAGC... The intact gene had ATG TTT CTC. So, let's see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...

Mutant 2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG C...

Wait, maybe the first few nucleotides. Let me count:

Intact: positions 1-20 (approx):

1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: CTC (Leu)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
... and so on.

Mutant 2: first part is ATG TTC TAA GCT...

So, positions 4-6: TTT → TTC (Phe to Phe, no change?), wait, no. Wait, no: the fourth nucleotide is T, in the intact it's T, but in mutant 2, maybe the fourth is T, fifth is T, sixth is C? Let me see:

Wait, the first part:

Intact
