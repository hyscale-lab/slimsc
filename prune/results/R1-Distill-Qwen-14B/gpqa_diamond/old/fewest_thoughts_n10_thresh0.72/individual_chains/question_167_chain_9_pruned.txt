Okay, so I have this question about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The state given is a Schrödinger cat state. The state vector is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). 

The non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but wait. I remember that Gaussian states are those that have a density matrix with a Gaussian distribution in phase space. The cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's definitely non-Gaussian.

The question is asking for nG when phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

First, let's plug in the values. Let me compute phi and alpha.

Phi is -pi/4. So 2phi is -pi/2. The sin(2phi) would be sin(-pi/2) which is -1.

Alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. So exp(-2alpha²) is exp(-2*(0.25))=exp(-0.5). 

So N squared is 1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5). Let me compute that. 

Exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, but N is a normalization factor, so the state |psi> is normalized as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N.

I think the next step is to find the density matrix rho for this state. The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

But calculating rho might be a bit involved. Alternatively, I remember that for a state which is a superposition of two coherent states, the Wigner function is non-Gaussian, and the relative entropy would measure the distance from a Gaussian state.

Wait, but the relative entropy in this case is between the given state and the reference Gaussian state. Hmm, but what is the reference Gaussian state here? Because if the state is a superposition, it's non-Gaussian. But the reference Gaussian state might be the mixture of the two coherent states perhaps?

Wait, the problem defines tau as the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state. So I'm not sure if tau is a specific Gaussian state, like a coherent state or a squeezed state or a thermal state. But perhaps the reference Gaussian state here is the completely mixed state or a coherent state?

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that would be the closest Gaussian state to the given state. But that might complicate things.

Wait, in the context of non-Gaussianity measures, sometimes the relative entropy is
