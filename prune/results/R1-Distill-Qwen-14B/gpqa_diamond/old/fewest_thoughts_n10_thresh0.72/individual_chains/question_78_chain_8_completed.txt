Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step. I remember that when a charge is moving, it generates both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials.

The question says that a point charge q is moving with a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a later time t, where t is greater than the time tr when the field was generated. The observation point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated to the observation point. Oh wait, so d is the displacement from the charge's position at tr to the point r. So, r would be the position vector of the observation point, and d is r minus the position of the charge at tr. Or wait, maybe d is from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - s(tr). Yeah, that makes sense.

The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. So I need to find expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t.

I recall that the scalar potential V due to a charge moving with velocity v is given by something like V = (q/(4πε0)) * (1/(d·(c) - (d·v)/c )) but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, no, the general formula for the potentials from a moving charge involves some terms with the velocity and the distance.

Wait, the scalar potential for a charge in motion is a bit different from the static case. In the static case, V is just q/(4πε0 r), but when the charge is moving, the potential depends on the relative motion. Because the charge's motion affects the fields due to special relativity considerations and the like.

Wait, but the options have different forms. Let me think about the Liénard potentials. Oh right, the scalar potential from a moving charge is given by V = (q/(4πε0)) * (gamma) [1/(R - (v·R)/c²)] where R is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of retarded times.

Wait, but the observation time is t, and the charge's position at the retarded time tr is s(tr). The vector d is from s(tr) to r, so d = r - s(tr). So d is the displacement vector between the charge's position when it generated the field and the observation point.

In the context of retarded potentials, the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε0)) [1/(d c - (d·v)) / c² ]? Wait, not exactly. Let me think again. The scalar potential from a moving charge is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [ 1/( |d| c - (d · v) ) ] ? Or maybe it's 1/(d c - (d · v)/c²) ?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's try to write down the general expressions. The scalar potential due to a charge q moving with velocity v at time tr (retarded time) is V = q/(4πε0) * (1/(d c - (d · v)/c ) ), but I'm getting confused about the denominators.

Wait, no, the denominator comes from the Lorentz contraction. Alternatively, the general expression for the scalar potential from a charge in motion is:

V(r, t) = [ q ] / [4πε0 ( |d| (1 - (v²/c²))^(1/2) (1 - (v·d̂)/c ) ) ]

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps it's simpler. The scalar potential for a charge in motion is:

V = (q/(4πε0)) * [ 1/(d c - (v · d)) / c ]

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think of the expression in another way. The denominator for the scalar potential when the charge is moving is (d c - (v · d̂) d), but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, I think the correct form for the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [ 1/(d c - (d·v)) / c² ] ?

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the denominator is (d c - (d·v)). Wait, let's think about the units. The denominator should have units of length, since it's in the denominator of a potential which has units of volts (joules per coulomb).

Wait, let me think about the general formula. The scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) for a charge in motion are given by:

V(r, t) = [ q ] / [4πε0 ( c (r - s(tr)) - (v (r - s(tr)) · v ) / c ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it as:

V(r, t) = q/(4πε0) [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c ) ) ]

Similarly, the vector potential A is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ0 q v)/(4π) [ d/( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c ) ) ] 

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options.

The options given are:

Option C: V = qc/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)), and A = μo q c v / (4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, let me compute the units. Let's see:

For V, the numerator is q*c. The denominator is (d c - d·v). Let me see the units:

d has units of meters, c is m/s. So each term in denominator has units of m*(m/s) = m²/s. Hmm, but that would give V's denominator as (m²/s), so the denominator has units (m²/s). The numerator is q*c, which is (C)*(m/s) = (A s)(m/s) = A m. So V would have units (A m) / (m²/s) = (A s) / m. Because A m / (m²/s) = (A m s) ) / m² = A s/m. But volts are J/C = (N m)/C = (kg m²/s² )/(A s ) = kg m/(A s² ). Hmm, not sure if that's matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the standard expressions.

Wait, the standard expression for the scalar potential of a charge in motion is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d c - (d·v))] * [1/(c²)] ?

Wait, that might be getting somewhere. Or perhaps I should recall the expressions for potentials in the context of retarded times.

Wait, another approach: the scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(|d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c )) ]

But then d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So |d| is the distance between the two points.

Wait, but how does this compare to the options given?

Looking at option C: V is ( q c ) / [4πε0 (d c - (d · v) ) ]

So, the denominator is d c - (d · v). Let me factor this as d(c) - v·d = d (c - (v·d)/d ).

Wait, no, because d is a vector, but in the denominator, perhaps it's |d| c minus the dot product.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for V is:

V = (q c)/(4πε0 (c |d| - (d · v)) )

Because when you have a denominator like c |d| - (d ·v), that would have units of m/s * m = m²/s, which would make the denominator (m²/s), and the numerator is q c (C m/s), so overall V would have (C m/s) / (m²/s) = C/(m), which is correct since V is in volts, which is J/C = (N m)/C = (kg m²/s²)/C = kg m/(s² C). Wait, not sure about the unit analysis, but the structure of the option looks plausible.

If that's the case, then the scalar potential would be (q c )/(4πε0 (c |d| - (d ·v) )).

Similarly, the vector potential A would be (μ0 q v )/(4π (c |d| - (d ·v) )).

Looking at the options, option C has:

V = qc / [4πε0 (d c - (d · v) ) ]

Which could be written as (q c)/(4πε0 (d c - (d · v) )).

Wait, but d is a vector, so d c is a vector multiplied by a scalar. But the denominator in the option is a scalar? Because it's written as d c - (d · v), which would be a scalar because d is a vector, c is scalar, so d c is a vector, but subtracting a scalar (d · v) would not make sense dimensionally. Hmm, wait no—wait, no, I must have made a mistake. The way it's written in option C is d c - (d · v). But d is a vector, so d c is a vector. Then (d · v) is a scalar, so you can't subtract a scalar from a vector. So that can't be right. So maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I misunderstood the notation.

Wait, perhaps in the options, d is actually the magnitude of vector d. Because if d is a vector, then the expression in the denominator would be ambiguous. So perhaps in the options, d represents |d|, the scalar magnitude of the vector d.

If that's the case, then for option C, the denominator is |d| c - (d · v). Because d is a scalar in that case. So that would make sense, because |d| is a scalar, and (d · v) is a scalar (because d is a vector, but in the option, maybe d is |d| multiplied by the cosine of the angle between d and v. Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, no, if d is the magnitude of the vector, then the expression would be |d| c - (v · d), where d is the vector. So (v · d) is the dot product of v and d, which is |v||d| cos(theta), which is a scalar.

Wait, but in option C, it's written as d c - (d · v), where d is |d|. So that would be |d| c - v · d, which is a scalar. So the denominator becomes |d| c - (v · d), which is a scalar. So option C's V is (q c)/(4πε0 (|d| c - v · d)).

Similarly, the vector potential in option C is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (|d| c - v · d)).

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think about the standard expression.

From what I remember, the scalar potential V due to a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = [ q ] / [4πε0 ( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c )) ] 

= [ q ] / [4πε0 ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) ]

Because d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d, so d̂ = d/|d|, so (v · d̂) = (v · d)/|d|.

So substituting that in, V is [ q ] / [4πε0 ( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c )) ] 

= [ q ] / [4πε0 ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) ]

Which can be written as [ q c ] / [4πε0 ( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Ah, because we multiplied numerator and denominator by c:

= (q c) / [4πε0 (c |d| - (v · d)) ]

Which matches option C's expression for V. So V is (q c)/(4πε0 (c |d| - (v · d)) ).

Similarly, the vector potential A is given by:

A(r, t) = [ μ0 q v ] / [4π ( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c )) ]

Which again becomes [ μ0 q v ] / [4π ( |d| - (v · d)/c ) ]

= [ μ0 q v c ] / [4π ( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Which is option C's expression for A.

So option C's expressions match these.

Now, let me check the other options.

Option D: denominator is (d c + (d ·v)), which would have the same structure but with a plus sign. That doesn't seem right because, in the denominator, we have c|d| minus (v ·d), not plus. So option D is probably incorrect.

Option A: V is static (no velocity dependence), but A is proportional to v squared. That doesn't make sense because A should be linear in v. So A is likely incorrect.

Option B: V is static, and A is proportional to v over c squared. But with V being static, that would be the case for a charge at rest, but for a moving charge, V should depend on the motion, so option B is probably incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) at time \( t \) for a moving charge \( q \), we consider the charge's motion and the retarded time \( t_r \). The displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) is defined as the vector from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), i.e., \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \). The velocity of the charge at \( t_r \) is \( \vec{v} \). The potentials are influenced by the relative motion of the charge and the observer.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   The scalar potential for a moving charge is modified due to relativistic effects. The general expression is:
   \[
   V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{1}{|\vec{d}| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)},
   \]
   where \( \hat{d} = \frac{\vec{d}}{|\vec{d}|} \) is the unit vector in the direction of \( \vec{d} \). This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 \left(c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}\right)}.
   \]
   This matches the form given in **Option C**.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   The vector potential for a moving charge is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) and is given by:
   \[
   \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{|\vec{d}| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)}.
   \]
   Substituting the denominator as before, this becomes:
   \[
   \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi \left(c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}\right)}.
   \]
   This also matches the form given in **Option C**.

3. **Analysis of Other Options:**
   - **Option A:** Assumes a static scalar potential \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is incorrect for a moving charge. Additionally, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \propto \vec{v}^2 \) is inconsistent with the expected linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \).
   - **Option B:** Similarly assumes a static scalar potential \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is invalid for a moving charge. The vector potential \( \vec{A} \propto \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} \) does not match the correct form.
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both potentials includes a \( +\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) term, which is incorrect. The correct denominator should involve \( c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \), not a sum.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
