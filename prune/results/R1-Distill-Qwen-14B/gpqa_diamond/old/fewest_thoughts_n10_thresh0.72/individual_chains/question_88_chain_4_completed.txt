Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and immune responses. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The setup is that they tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they gave these to mice orally. When they did in vivo imaging, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, which makes sense because the stomach is acidic. Then some got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They isolated Peyer's patches, which I know are these specialized sites in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) where immune responses are initiated, especially for things that pass through the gut.

They took the proliferating cell population from the Peyer patches and sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, finding high variability. So the question is asking which process is responsible for that.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation
B) Complement activation
C) Class switching recombination
D) VDJ recombination

Hmm. Let me think about each process.

VDJ recombination is the process where during B cell development in the bone marrow, the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to form the variable region of the B cell receptor. This happens early on, like during the formation of the immune repertoire. So, if the cells are already in the Peyer patches and have started proliferating, maybe this isn't the main process happening here. VDJ is more about initial diversity, not about further variation after antigen encounter.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cell has been activated by an antigen. This process introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, leading to more diverse antibodies. This happens in the germinal centers, which are part of secondary lymphoid organs like lymph nodes and Peyer patches. So the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes likely comes from this process.

Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), but this doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. It's more about the type of antibody produced, not the diversity of the specific antigen-binding sites.

Complement activation is part of the immune response, particularly the classical pathway, where complement proteins are activated and help in pathogen lysis or opsonization. But this doesn't directly relate to the variability in the genes.

So putting it together: the cells in the Peyer patches are probably activated B cells undergoing proliferation. The variable heavy chain gene variability is due to mutations introduced during the immune response. That points to somatic hypermutation as the process.


The question involves analyzing the immune response to rotavirus in mice, focusing on the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating cells isolated from Peyer patches. Peyer patches are sites of immune activation in the gut, and the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that introduces diversity in the antigen-binding regions of antibodies.

- **Option A: Somatic hypermutation**  
  This process occurs in activated B cells during the immune response, introducing point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor. This leads to increased diversity in antigen recognition and is consistent with the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes. Somatic hypermutation typically occurs in germinal centers, which are part of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches.

- **Option B: Complement activation**  
  Complement activation involves the classical pathway and is related to pathogen lysis or opsonization. It does not directly contribute to variability in the variable heavy chain genes and is therefore not relevant here.

- **Option C: Class switching recombination**  
  This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not introduce variability in the variable regions of the antibody. It is unrelated to the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

- **Option D: VDJ recombination**  
  VDJ recombination occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J gene segments are combined to form the variable region of the B cell receptor. This process generates initial diversity but does not account for the variability observed in activated B cells in Peyer patches after antigen encounter.

Given the context of activated B cells in Peyer patches and the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**, which introduces mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor during the immune response.

Answer: A
