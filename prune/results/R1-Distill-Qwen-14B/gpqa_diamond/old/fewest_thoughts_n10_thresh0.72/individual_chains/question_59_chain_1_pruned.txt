Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's see. The problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. And the options are four different pH values. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to consider the neutralization reactions. Acids donate H+ ions, and bases donate OH- ions. The key is to find out whether the mixture is acidic, basic, or neutral. If there's excess acid, the solution will be acidic; if there's excess base, it'll be basic; else, it's neutral and pH is 7.

So, let's break down each solution:

1. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. It dissociates partially. So, it contributes H+ ions, but not completely.

2. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into H+ and Cl- ions.

3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH- ions.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution.

Calculating moles for each:

For CH3COOH:
Molarity (M) = moles / liters. So, moles = M * L.
Volume is 0.5 L (500 mL), Molarity is 0.1 M.
Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Since CH3COOH is weak, in pure water, it would release some H+. But when mixed with other acids and bases, the situation might be more complicated. But maybe I should first calculate all the H+ and OH- contributions and see if they neutralize each other.

For HCl:
Volume is 0.4 L, Molarity 0.2 M.
Moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

HCl is a strong acid, so it gives 0.08 moles of H+.

For Ba(OH)2:
Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.
Volume is 0.3 L, Molarity 0.3 M.
Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.
Moles of OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So, let's sum up the H+ and OH- contributions.

Total H+ from CH3COOH and HCl:
Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so does it contribute H+ in the presence of a strong acid and a strong base? Hmm. Maybe not, because the H+ from HCl is a strong acid and will dominate. Wait, but we have both H+ and OH- from other sources. Let's think about neutralization.

Wait, when you mix strong acid and strong base, they will neutralize each other first, producing water and a salt. Any excess acid or base will determine the pH.

So, the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH; the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, but it's a weak acid. So, perhaps in the mixture, the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react first, and any leftover acid or base will determine the pH
