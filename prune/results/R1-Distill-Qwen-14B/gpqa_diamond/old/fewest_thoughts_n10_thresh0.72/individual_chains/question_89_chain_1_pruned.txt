Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out what's going on step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product, 1, is a light yellow solid. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, I remember that KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. When dibromide compounds react with a base, they often undergo elimination reactions, forming alkenes via an E2 mechanism. So, reacting 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would likely lead to a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two equivalents of HBr and forming an alkene. But since it's 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would probably form a double bond between the two central carbons, giving 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on opposite ends, maybe.

Wait, when you eliminate two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, you form an alkene. The structure would become an adamantane ring with a double bond. But wait, adamantane is a bicyclic structure with four six-membered rings. If the bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those, but in this case, the structure is 1,3, which are opposite each other. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a bridge.

Wait, maybe when KOH is used, it leads to the formation of a bicyclic diene. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely to form a more substituted double bond for stability. Let me think. The product after KOH is a light yellow solid. I think the product is 1,3-adamantadiene, which is a conjugated
