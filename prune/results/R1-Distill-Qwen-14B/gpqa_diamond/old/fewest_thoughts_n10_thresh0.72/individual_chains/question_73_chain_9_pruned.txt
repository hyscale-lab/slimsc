Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think this through.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. I need to find the relative speed from one's frame to the other and the total energy of the system.

Wait, but wait a second, when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the velocity addition formula. Newtonian mechanics would say the relative speed is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. But relativity is different because of the Lorentz factors involved.

Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). So here, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. Let me plug those in.

So the relative velocity would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c
