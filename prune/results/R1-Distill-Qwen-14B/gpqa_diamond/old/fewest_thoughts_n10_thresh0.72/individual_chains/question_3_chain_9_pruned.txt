Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator. I remember that the expectation value is like the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured the system many times. 

The problem states that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. Right, σz is diagonal, so its eigenstates are the standard basis states.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. So, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where ψ is the state vector.

Let me break this down. The expectation value is linear, so I can split it into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I need to compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately.

First, I'll compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The expectation value of σz for a state is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of σz? Oh right, σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. So for the state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1).

Given ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩, let's compute |a|² and |b|². 

a is 0.5, so |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|² is (3/4) = 0.75. 

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then 10⟨σz⟩ = 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now onto ⟨σx⟩. σx is the Pauli x matrix, which is not diagonal. Its eigenstates are a bit more complicated. But I remember that the expectation value of σx for a given state can be found using the components of the state.

Wait, another way: σx has matrix representation [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply σx to |↑⟩, it becomes |↓⟩ and vice versa. So the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ψ| σx |ψ.

Alternatively, for a state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, ⟨σx⟩ is 2(a b* + a* b) because σx in this basis is represented
