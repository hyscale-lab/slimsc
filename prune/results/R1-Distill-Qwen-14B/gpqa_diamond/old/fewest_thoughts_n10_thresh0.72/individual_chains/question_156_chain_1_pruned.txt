Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. The options are about how many peaks each would show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation involves adding an epoxide group across a double bond. The reaction is stereospecific, right? So the geometry of the starting alkene affects the product.

Wait, so for each reaction, the starting alkene is either E or Z. Let me think about their structures. (E)-oct-4-ene would have the two substituents on opposite sides of the double bond, while (Z) would have them on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. Since mCPBA is a peracid, it adds an oxygen across the double bond. The reaction is a cyclic transition state, so the stereochemistry of the starting alkene would influence the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

But wait, when the epoxide is formed, the reaction adds the oxygen in a specific way. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (like the other parts of the octene) are on opposite sides. So when the epoxide forms, the two new oxygen atoms would be added in a certain configuration.

Wait, no, mCPBA adds an oxygen in a way that creates an epoxide where the oxygen connects the two carbons of the double bond. The reaction is similar to an electrocyclic opening, but for epoxidation, it's more about the peracid adding across the double bond.

Wait, I think the reaction of mCPBA with an alkene forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Because the peracid adds in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face. Or does it create a trans configuration?

Wait, no. Let me think: mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen atoms add to the same face of the alkene. So
