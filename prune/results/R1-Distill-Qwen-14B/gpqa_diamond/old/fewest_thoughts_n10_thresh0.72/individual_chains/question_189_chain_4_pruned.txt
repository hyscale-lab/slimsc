Okay, so I've got this question about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which of the given particles isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

I remember that when a symmetry is spontaneously broken, it leads to the appearance of new particles called Goldstone bosons. These bosons are massless in the ideal case where the symmetry is exact, but they can get a mass if the symmetry is broken explicitly or if the theory has some other effects, like in the Higgs mechanism.

Let me go through each option.

A) Phonon: Phonons are related to the quantized vibrations in a crystal lattice. I think they arise from the breaking of translational symmetry in the solid state. Wait, but isn't that more like a broken continuous symmetry? Because in a crystal, the translational symmetry is discrete now. Oh wait, phonons are massless in the long wavelength limit, which makes me think they are Goldstone bosons. So they come from spontaneous symmetry breaking.

B) Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons, right? They were originally considered in the context of nuclear physics and pion physics. I think they arise from a different kind of symmetry breaking, maybe an approximate symmetry. Oh wait, Skyrme proposed a model where pions emerge as Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in the QCD vacuum. But Skyrmions themselves are solutions in that model, so maybe they aren't Goldstone bosons themselves but are related.

C) Magnon: Magnons are the quanta of spin waves in a magnetic material. They arise when the system has a broken rotational symmetry, like in a magnet where spins align. So I think magnons are Goldstone bosons of the broken rotational symmetry in the magnetic material. So they are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

D) Pion: Pions are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in the QCD theory. In the low-energy limit, when the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, the pions (and their partners) appear as massless particles. But due to chiral perturbation theory, they gain a small mass. So yeah, pions are definitely from spontaneous symmetry breaking.

So the question is which particle is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Let's see.

Wait, the phonon is a Goldstone boson from lattice symmetry breaking. The
