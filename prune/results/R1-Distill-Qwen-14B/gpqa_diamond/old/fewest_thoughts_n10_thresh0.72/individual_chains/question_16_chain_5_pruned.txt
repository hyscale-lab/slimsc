Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in various organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? And that happens when a molecule has chirality, meaning it has a stereocenter and is not superimposable on its mirror image.

So I need to look at each compound one by one and determine if it has any chiral centers. Wait, but sometimes molecules can have other forms of asymmetry too, like in allenes or certain ring systems. But I think for this question, it's mostly about stereocenters.

Let me list each compound and check:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Structure: It's an alkene with substituents on C1 and C2. Wait, C1 has Cl and a CH2CH2 group. Wait no, butene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. Wait, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon in the double bond.

Wait, structure: the molecule is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Hmm, maybe I should think about substituents. So for the double bond being between C1 and C
