Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand what's going on.

So, the problem says that there's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They were heated to 200Â°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases formed. Without cooling, these gases were passed through three tubes. Tube 1 had anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which probably acts as a drying agent. Tube 2 had a Ca(OH)2 solution, maybe for absorbing CO2? And tube 3 had red-hot copper, which I think reacts with certain gases, like maybe sulfur dioxide or something else.

The results are that tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, tube 3 gained 0.80 grams, and tube 2 didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let me think about what each part means.

First, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose into gases. The gases pass through these tubes. Since tube 1's weight increased, that suggests it absorbed some moisture or perhaps another gas. Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent, I think. So any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed here. So perhaps the gases produced include water vapor, but since the salts are heated without air, maybe it's a decomposition reaction that produces H2O and other gases.

Wait, but the salts are being heated, so perhaps they are losing water of crystallization or decomposing into their constituent ions. For example, if they are metal carbonates or sulfates, they might decompose into metal oxides, CO2, or SO2, etc.

But the first tube (Mg(ClO4)2) gained 3.60 grams. Mg(ClO4)2 is highly deliquescent, so it could be absorbing water. So the increase in weight is due to the absorption of water vapor. So the gases contain H2O.

Then, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas passed through it didn't change the weight, that suggests that no CO2 was present. Because Ca(OH)2 reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water, which would increase the tube's weight. But the weight didn't change, so no CO2 was present. Or perhaps the gas didn't contain any CO2, so tube 2 didn't react. Alternatively, maybe the gas was something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution.

Wait, but if there was CO2, tube 2 would have reacted, increasing its weight. Since it didn't, maybe the gas is not CO2. So perhaps the gas is something that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2, like H2 or NH3? Hmm, but NH3 is a base, would it react with Ca(OH)2 solution? Maybe not,
