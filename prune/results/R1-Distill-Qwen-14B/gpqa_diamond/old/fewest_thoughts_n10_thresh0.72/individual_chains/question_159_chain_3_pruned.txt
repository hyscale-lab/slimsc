Okay, so I have this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me think. The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. I remember that quasars can have emission lines, and sometimes their light is shifted due to the expansion of the universe. Oh wait, this is about redshift!

So the peak at 790 nm probably corresponds to a known emission line. I'm trying to remember what emission lines quasars have. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is a prominent one, but that's in the ultraviolet. Wait, when quasars are at high redshift, their emission lines can be redshifted into the optical or infrared. 

Wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is at about 121 nm (121.6 nm to be precise) in the rest frame. So if it's observed at 790 nm, what's the redshift? Redshift z is given by (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 / 121.6 is around... Let me compute that. 121.6 times 6 is 729.6, 790 minus 729.6 is 60.4. So 6.6 (approx) times 121.6 is 790.4. So 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5. So z ≈ 6.5 - 1 = 5.5? Wait, wait. No, wait: z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1. So 790 / 121.6 is about 6.5, so z =5.5. But wait, maybe I should get more precise. Let me calculate 790 /121.6. Let's see, 121.6 *6=729.6, 729.6 + 121.6 =851.2, which is over 790. So 6.5 would be 6.5 *121.6 = 789.5. Oh, so 790 is about 6.5 times rest, so
