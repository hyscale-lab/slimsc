Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about the para-isomer yield for six different compounds. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the least para yield comes first, and the highest comes last.

The compounds are all benzene derivatives with different substituents. The substituents are: 1) methyl (CH3), 2) ethoxycarbonyl (COOEt), 3) chlorine (Cl), 4) nitro (NO2), 5) ethyl (C2H5), 6) carboxylic acid (COOH). All undergoing bromination with excess Br2, and only one monobromo derivative forms.

Wait, in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positionsâ€”like ortho, meta, or para.

I remember that substituents can be either activating (like -NH2, -OCH3, -OH) which are electron-donating, making the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions. Or deactivating (like -NO2, -COOH), which are electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive but still directing.

So each substituent will influence where the bromine adds. Bromine tends to add in the position(s) that are most activated. If a substituent is ortho/para-directing, then the para position would be possible. If meta-directing, the para isn't a main site. 

Wait, wait. Wait, for each substituent, I need to know whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing.

Let's list each substituent:

1) CH3: methyl group. It's an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it's ortho/para-directing. So when bromine is added, the major products would be para and ortho. So in the case of excess Br2, perhaps the para isomer is more favored? Or the ortho is? Wait, but when the substituent is activating, the ring is more reactive, so the substitution occurs more easily. But in mono-substitution, the question is about where the Br adds.

Wait, but for substituents that are ortho/para-directing, the incoming electrophile will add predominantly to the ortho and para positions. But if the substituent is bulky, the para might be more favored than ortho because ortho can be hindered. But in this case, the substituents vary in size.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, what is the ratio of para to other isomers.

So, I need to figure out for each substituent how much the para product is formed.

So, let's go through each substituent:

1) CH3 (methyl): It's an activating, ortho/para director. So the incoming bromine can add to ortho, meta, para? Wait, no, it's ortho and para. So in bromination, the major products are ortho and para. But which is more?

Wait, I thought that for activating groups, para is often the major product because the ortho positions are sterically hindered, especially when the substituent is bulky. But methyl is not that bulky, so perhaps para is more than ortho. Or maybe for some substituents, para is the major. Alternatively, sometimes the para isomer is the major when the substituent is such that the ortho is hindered.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For example, when you have a substituent like -OH, which is activating and ortho/para director. The major product is para because the ortho is more hindered. So, for benzyl groups, perhaps the same applies.

So for CH3 (methyl), being a smaller substituent, maybe the ortho is less hindered. So maybe the para and ortho are about the same, but with perhaps ortho having a slight edge? Or maybe for less bulky groups, para is more favored.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the para is the major when the substituent is small because the ortho positions are not as hindered. Hmm, perhaps I should look for a general trend.

Wait, in the case of substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer tends to be the major product because the ortho positions are closer to the substituent and might have more steric hindrance, especially with larger substituents. But in the case of a small substituent like methyl, maybe ortho is more possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the position's activation is more important. Wait, the activating groups have conjugated structures that direct the electrophile. For example, in some cases, the para position might be more activated than the ortho. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let's move on and come back.

2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl): This is a strong electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's a deactivating group. It's meta-directing. So the incoming Br would add to the meta position. So the para product would be minor. So the para yield would be low. So for this substituent, the para isomer is not a major product, so the weight fraction is low.

3) Cl: Chlorine is a deactivating group because it's more electronegative. But it's ortho/para-directing because the lone pairs on Cl can donate electron density through resonance (but it's deactivating overall due to inductive effect). So Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para director. So incoming Br would go to ortho and para. But again, which is more?

Wait, for Cl, I think the para product is major. Because even though Cl is ortho/para, the para is usually more favored due to less steric hindrance. So the para isomer would be the major product here. So the weight fraction of para would be high.

4) NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the incoming Br would go to the meta position. Therefore, the para isomer would not be formed (or very minor), so the weight fraction is low.

5) C2H5 (ethyl): Similar to methyl, it's an activating group (alkyl, electron-donating) and ortho/para director. So, when Br adds, it can go to ortho or para. So the question is, which is more favored. For larger substituents like ethyl, perhaps the para is more favored because the ortho positions are crowded. So for ethyl, the para yield is higher than methyl's? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, ethyl is a larger substituent than methyl. So in ethylbenzene, when brominated, the para isomer is more formed than ortho because the ortho positions are more hindered. So, for substituents like ethyl, the para isomer is more major than for methyl.

6) COOH (carboxylic acid): This is a strong deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing -COOH group. But wait, is it meta or para directing? Wait, carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group, so it's a meta-directing group. So incoming Br would add to the meta position. So the para isomer is not formed much, so low weight fraction.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, I think that for COOH, the substituent is a meta director. So the Br would add at the meta position, thus making the para product minor.

So, let me summarize each substituent's para product yield:

1) CH3: Activating, ortho/para. So para is major. Not sure how much, but higher than meta directors.

2) COOEt: Deactivating, meta. So para is minor.

3) Cl: Deactivating, ortho/para. Para is major.

4) NO2: De
