Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an approach that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries exactly?

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these, so I need to think about each one.

First, let's break down each symmetry.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. SMEFT operators should definitely respect this because the Standard Model does, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from it. So operators must be Lorentz invariant.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's about the overall symmetries of spacetime, including momentum conservation. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect Poincare symmetry because all local field theories do. So operators must be Poincare invariant.

3. CP Symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry, though. Wait, but in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? I think operators can violate CP, but wait, is that true? Or is it that the theory must respect certain symmetries, like maybe CPT?

Wait, no. Wait, the Standard Model doesn't have a global symmetry that requires CP conservation. So operators in SMEFT could violate CP. So CP symmetry isn't necessarily something that all operators must respect. So option 3 might not be correct.

4. CPT Symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories must respect CPT symmetry because it's a consequence of having antiparticles and the principles of quantum mechanics. So any operator in a valid QFT must respect CPT. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT.

So putting it all together: which symmetries must all operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), CPT (4). CP (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators, so it's out.

Wait, but wait. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So in the options, if Poin
