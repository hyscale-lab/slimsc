Okay, so I've got this question here about which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, right? Like when compounds have the same molecular formula but different spatial arrangements, making them non-superimposable mirror images. These are also called enantiomers. So, the question is giving four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones can have optical isomers.

Let me look at each compound one by one. 

First, compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but waitâ€”biphenyl structures can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, do they need a chiral center? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, could there be a plane of symmetry here? If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe not. But if they're arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then it can have optical isomerism. Alternatively, could the molecule have a center of symmetry? Let me think. The substituents are on the biphenyl at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro group at 6' and a carboxylate ester at 2. Wait, but when you have a biphenyl, the arrangement around the single bond can lead to cis or trans configurations. Oh wait, but for biphenyls, if the substituents are in such a way that they're not symmetrical, it could lead to the possibility of enantiomers. Alternatively, maybe this compound has a plane of symmetry. Hmm, it's a bit confusing. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically on each benzene ring, the molecule might not have a chiral center. But if their arrangement is not symmetrical, perhaps it creates a chiral center. I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should come back to this one after checking the others.

Moving on to compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is OMe-O-C-OHCH2? Wait, no. Let me think. 2-hydro
