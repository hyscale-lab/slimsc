Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions. Each reaction uses a different reducing agent on an unknown compound, and the products are given. I need to find the correct starting materials A and B from the options provided.

The products formed are both (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) but with different stereochemistry: (R) and (S) configurations respectively. The reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Hmm. I remember that BH3 and LiBH4 are reducing agents, commonly used for ketone reductions, but wait—no, wait. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that usually reduces carbonyl groups. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are different.

Wait, wait. Oh right! In the case of ketone reductions, both are used. But wait, no—LiBH4 is a borohydride reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. While BH3 is usually used for hydroboration, which is a two-step process often leading to alcohols but with anti-Markovnikov addition. But wait, wait. No, when it comes to the reduction of ketones, both can be used. Wait, or maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think.

Wait, maybe it's about the conditions. Oh, right! LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, no, actually, BH3 is a Lewis acid and is usually used with other reagents like THF to form BH3·THF, which is a better reducing agent than LiBH4 for some cases. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the key here is the type of reaction. Wait, when it comes to the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, both LiBH4 and BH3 (as in BH3·THF) are used. But wait, perhaps the reaction conditions affect the stereochemistry of the product. Oh! Oh right! Because in some cases, the reduction can lead to retention or inversion of configuration,
