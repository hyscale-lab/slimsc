Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations, especially when mixing different solutions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem is: I have three solutions mixed together. The first is 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. The second is 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, a strong acid. The third is 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, a strong base. I need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the first thing to do is probably figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution.

For the acetic acid (CH3COOH), the molarity is 0.1 M and the volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume, so 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely, but I think in this case since it's being mixed with a strong acid and a strong base, the dissociation might not be the main concern. Wait, no, because the strong acid (HCl) will completely dissociate, providing a lot of H+ ions. The Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

So let's compute moles for each component:

1. CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it will contribute some H+ ions, but maybe the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will have a more significant effect.

2. HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl^- ions. So 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl.

3. Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, when you mix these, the H+ from HCl will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. Also, the acetic acid's H+ may or may not play a role, depending on whether there's excess H+ or OH- after the reaction.

So, the initial H+ comes only from HCl (since acetic acid is weak and initially, the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to strong acids and bases). So total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

Wait, but when H+ and OH- react, they neutralize each other: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ will be 0.08, and OH- is 0.18. Let's subtract which one is in excess.

0.08 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH-:

H+ will be the limiting reagent. So all 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-.

After reaction, the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, that's 0.10 moles of OH- in the total solution.

Wait, but what about the acetic acid? Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it might affect the pH if it doesn't get neutralized. However, since there's excess OH-, which is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Let's think: when OH- is added to a solution of CH3COOH, the OH- will react with the H+ in CH3COOH, but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release many H+ ions on its own. But in the presence of a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reaction between OH- and CH3COOH.

The reaction would be: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3CO
