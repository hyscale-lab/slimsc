Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, let me read through it carefully. Alright, the setup is that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments, nothing else. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, varying in MeV.

Wait, let me break this down. So the initial nucleus is at rest, which means the total initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.

First, let me figure out the rest masses of the two fragments. The problem says the sum of their rest masses is 0.99M. Also, one is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the smaller mass as m, so the other is 2m. So m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M → m = 0.99M/3 = 0.33M. Thus, the two masses are 0.33M and 0.66M.

Wait, but wait. The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So, the rest mass energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. After fission, the rest masses are 0.33M and 0.66M. So their rest mass energies are 0.33Mc² and 0.66Mc², which sum to 0.99Mc² = 297 GeV. So the total rest mass after fission is less than before, which means energy must have been released—probably as kinetic energy and maybe other forms, but the problem says nothing else is produced, so maybe all the energy released is kinetic?

Wait, but in reality, in fission, some energy is released as kinetic energy, and some is carried away as neutrons or other particles, but the problem says nothing else is produced, so perhaps all the binding energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the two fragments. Hmm.

But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest. So the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Therefore, their kinetic energies can be found using conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. Since the nucleus is at rest initially, the total momentum after must be zero, so m1 v1 = m2 v2 but with opposite directions. Wait, m1 is 0.66M (the more massive one), and m2 is 0.33M.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: m1 is the more massive fragment, so m1=2m, since one is twice as massive as the other. Wait, earlier I said m is for the smaller, so m1=0.66M, m2=0.33M.

So, the momentum equation is m1 v1 = m2 v2 in magnitude but opposite in direction. So m1 v1 = - m2 v2. But since we're considering magnitudes, I can write m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, more precisely, since the initial momentum is zero, the sum of the momenta after must be zero. So m1 v1 + m2 v2 = 0 → m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So their velocities are in opposite directions, which makes sense.

Now, the kinetic energy of each fragment is (1/2) m v². But wait, here's the thing: since we're dealing with masses that are a significant fraction of the speed of light (given the energies are in GeV, which is a relativistic regime), the non-relativistic approximation might not hold. So the correct calculation would involve relativistic expressions, but the classical (non-relativistic) approximation would use KE = (1/2)mv².

The question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 (more massive fragment's kinetic energy) and the classical approximation T1_class.

So first, I need to calculate T1_class, then the actual relativistic T1, then find the difference.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of energy conservation. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. So:

Initial energy = 300 GeV = (0.33M c²) + (0.66M c²) + (K1 + K2).

Wait, 0.33M +0.66M = 0.99M, so their rest mass energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. So K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

But from momentum conservation, the velocities are related. So how to find K1 and K2?

Alternatively, using conservation of energy and momentum, we can set up equations.

Let me think in terms of the center of mass frame, which is the rest frame of the initial nucleus. So after fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions, each carrying some kinetic energy.

In the rest frame, the total momentum is zero, so the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies.

So, the total energy is E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Each fragment's energy is gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So E1 = gamma1 * m1 c², E2 = gamma2 * m2 c².

Also, the total momentum is zero, so gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. Because momentum is gamma m v.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem in terms of their velocities.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use the invariant quantity in relativity. The invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. But in this case, sum p is zero, so sum E^2 = (sum E)^2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. But since p_total is zero, the invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2. So the invariant mass is E_total / c², which is 300 GeV / c², same as initial. But after fission, the invariant mass is the sum of the two fragment energies. Hmm, not sure if this approach helps.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in the rest frame, the total energy is the sum of the two energies, and their momenta are equal and opposite.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the kinetic energies. Let me denote the kinetic energies as K1 and K2 for the two fragments. Then, their total energy is E1 = m1 c² + K1, E2 = m2 c² + K2. So sum E = 300 GeV = (m1 + m2) c² + (K1 + K2) = 0.99 Mc² + (K1 + K2). As before, K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

But also, from momentum conservation, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of velocities and kinetic energies.

But maybe I should think about the non-relativistic case first, to find T1_class.

In the non-relativistic case, the two fragments will have velocities such that m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, the more massive fragment is m1 = 0.66M, the lighter is m2 = 0.33M. So m1 = 2 m2.

So, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

But in the non-relativistic case, kinetic energies are (1/2) m v². So K1 = 0.5 m1 v1², K2 = 0.5 m2 v2².

Substituting m1 = 2 m2, and v2 = 2 v1.

So K1 = 0.5 * 2 m2 * v1² = m2 v1².

K2 = 0.5 * m2 * (2 v1)² = 0.5 m2 *4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

So K1 = m2 v1², K2 = 2 m2 v1².

Total kinetic energy K1 + K2 = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

So 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

So K1 = 1 GeV.

Wait, so in the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment has kinetic energy of 1 GeV.

But wait, let's make sure. Because m1 is 0.66M, m2 is 0.33M. So m2 = 0.33M. So m2 v1² = 1 GeV → (0.33M) v1² = 1 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The units here might be a bit tricky. Since we're working in GeV for energy, but M is a mass. Let's see, the initial rest mass energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. So M is 300 GeV / c².

So m2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV / c² = 99 GeV / c².

So m2 v1² = 1 GeV → (99 GeV/c²) v1² = 1 GeV → v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) = (1/99) c² → v1 = c * sqrt(1/99) ≈ c * 0.1, since sqrt(1/99) is about 0.1.

Wait, sqrt(1/99) is approximately 0.1, yes. So v1 is about 0.1c, which is non-relativistic, so the non-relativistic approach is valid? Hmm, but 0.1c is 30 million meters per second, which is a significant fraction of c. For M being on the order of GeV/c², so for the nucleus, which is on the order of 1e-27 kg. Wait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

But given that the velocities are about 0.1c, the non-relativistic approximation might not be great. So the relativistic calculation is necessary for an accurate T1.

So the correct T1 would be higher than the non-relativistic approximation, perhaps? Because relativistic kinetic energy is higher for the same velocity. Or wait, let's think.

Wait, the non-relativistic case gives K1 as 1 GeV. But in reality, the actual KE would be higher because when you have higher velocities, the relativistic effects kick in, so the actual KE is more than the non-relativistic value.

Wait, but wait, the sum of the kinetic energies in the classical case is 3 GeV, which matches the actual sum as well (since actual K1 + K2 =3 GeV). Hmm, but the actual KEs would be different because the velocities are different when considering relativity.

Wait, no. Wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So for each fragment, K = (gamma -1) m c².

But in the non-relativistic case, K = (1/2) mv². So for the same velocity, the relativistic KE is higher.

But the velocities in the relativistic case would be different because the momentum is not just mv but gamma m v. So the velocities would be lower than the non-relativistic case? Or higher?

Hmm, perhaps it's better to set up the equations properly.

Let me denote:

m1 = 2m, m2 = m. Since m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M.

Wait, M is the initial mass, so m1 = 2/3 M, m2 = 1/3 M.

The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero after fission. Therefore, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Also, the energy conservation gives:

gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = 300 GeV.

But since the initial nucleus is at rest, its rest energy is Mc²=300 GeV.

Wait, but the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, so their rest energies sum to 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV. So the kinetic energies sum to 3 GeV.

So, gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = 300 GeV.

But gamma1 m c² = K1 + m1 c².

Similarly, gamma2 m c² = K2 + m2 c².

So,

(K1 + m1 c²) + (K2 + m2 c²) ) = 300 GeV.

Which gives K1 + K2 + (m1 + m2)c² = 300 GeV → K1 + K2 = 3 GeV, which we already knew.

But again, the problem is that we have two equations and four variables (gamma1, gamma2, v1, v2), but perhaps we can find a relation between gamma1 and gamma2.

From the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since m1 = 2 m2,

gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Hmm, another equation needed. Let me think of the relationship between velocities and gamma factors.

We can express v in terms of beta (v = beta c), and then gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

But this might get complicated, but perhaps I can write in terms of beta.

Let me denote beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

Then, gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta1²), gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta2²).

From the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 beta1 c = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

Divide both sides by c:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But m1 = 2 m2.

So,

gamma1 (2 m2) beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2 → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

So, equation (1): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

Now, the energy equation is gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = 300 GeV.

But m1 = 2 m2, so:

gamma1 (2 m2) c² + gamma2 m2 c² = 300 GeV.

Dividing both sides by m2 c²:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 300 GeV / (m2 c²) = 300 GeV / ( (0.33 M) c² ).

But M c² is 300 GeV, so m2 c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV =99 GeV.

So,

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 300 GeV / (99 GeV) ) → 300 /99 ≈3.0303.

So,

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Hmm, equation (2): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

From equation (1), 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

Let me express gamma2 from equation (2): gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

Substitute into equation (1):

2 gamma1 beta1 = (3.0303 - 2 gamma1) beta2.

But I don't know the relation between beta1 and beta2 yet.

Wait, maybe I can assume that beta1 is much smaller than beta2? Because the more massive fragment would have less kinetic energy, perhaps moving slower. Alternatively, maybe not. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relation between beta1 and beta2.

Wait, from equation (1):

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta²), so:

[1/sqrt(1 - beta2^2)] beta2 = 2 [1/sqrt(1 - beta1^2)] beta1.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

[ (beta2)^2 / (1 - beta2^2) ) ] = [4 (beta1)^2 / (1 - beta1^2) ) ].

Hmm, complicated. Let me denote x = beta1, y = beta2. Then,

(y^2) / (1 - y^2) = 4 (x^2) / (1 - x^2).

But from equation (1):

gamma2 y = 2 gamma1 x → (1/sqrt(1 - y^2)) y = 2 (1/sqrt(1 - x^2)) x.

Squaring both sides:

y²/(1 - y²) =4 x²/(1 - x²).

Which is the same as the equation above.

So, I have:

y²/(1 - y^2) = 4 x²/(1 - x^2).

But I also have equation (2): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - x²), gamma2 =1/sqrt(1 - y²).

So,

2/(sqrt(1 -x²)) + 1/(sqrt(1 - y^2)) = 3.0303.

Hmm, this looks quite involved. Maybe I can make an approximation.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, we have beta <<1, so gamma≈1 + (1/2) beta².

But given that earlier, the non-relativistic velocity v1 was about 0.1c, so beta1=0.1, which is not that small, so the non-relativistic approximation may not hold. So the correct calculation would require solving the above equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution.

Let me proceed step by step.

Let me denote equation (1):

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

And equation (2):

2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

Let me denote equation (1a): gamma2 = (2 gamma1 beta1) / beta2.

Substitute into equation (2):

2 gamma1 + (2 gamma1 beta1)/beta2 =3.0303.

Hmm, but without knowing beta1 and beta2, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of gamma1.

But this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, let me assume that beta2 is much larger than beta1. But I don't know if that's the case.

Wait, given that m1 is twice m2, the more massive fragment, the more kinetic energy it has? No, wait, wait. Because K1 + K2 =3 GeV. If the more massive fragment is, perhaps it has a larger K?

Wait, no. Let me think. The initial nucleus is split into two parts, more massive and less massive. The more massive fragment, being heavier, would have less kinetic energy. Because when you split something into two unequal parts, the smaller part tends to have more kinetic energy.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of a simple example. Imagine a heavy object at rest, split into two unequal masses. The heavier piece would have less kinetic energy.

So in the non-relativistic case, K1 was 1 GeV, K2 was 2 GeV. So the heavier fragment has less KE.

So, perhaps in the relativistic case, the same holds. So the heavier fragment (m1) has lower KE than the lighter one.

So, the kinetic energies are K1 < K2.

So, m1 is more massive, K1 is less than K2.

Hmm, but that may not directly help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of gamma1 and beta1, and then solve numerically.

But this might be a bit beyond me without more advanced techniques. Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that beta2 is much larger than beta1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider that the kinetic energies are much smaller than the rest mass energies. So, perhaps I can use the approximation that gamma is approximately 1 + (K)/(m c²), where K is the kinetic energy.

But wait, in the non-relativistic case, K is (1/2) m v², which for m on the order of GeV/c² and v around 0.1c, K is on the order of GeV, which is much smaller than the rest mass energy (hundreds of GeV). So perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is okay for the KE.

Wait, but the problem is that the question is about the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So perhaps we need to compute the exact relativistic T1 and subtract the classical T1.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is small, but I don't know.

Hmm, maybe I can proceed by considering that the non-relativistic approximation gives K1 =1 GeV, but the actual value is higher. Let me think: since the velocities are relativistic, the actual T1 would be higher.

Wait, but no, wait. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, K1 is 1 GeV. In the relativistic case, the same velocity would have a higher KE. But wait, in reality, the velocity might be higher or lower?

Wait, the momentum equation in relativity is different. So, for the same velocity, the relativistic momentum is higher than the non-relativistic. So, for the same actual velocity, the relativistic momentum is higher, which would require a lower velocity to achieve the same momentum as in non-relativistic.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: The sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. In the classical case, K1 is 1 GeV, K2 is 2 GeV. So the difference between the correct and classical T1 is T1 -1 GeV.

So, what is the correct T1?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the velocities in the non-relativistic case, then compute the relativistic KE at those velocities.

Wait, but that's not correct because the velocities in the relativistic case would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the velocities in the non-relativistic case, then plug those velocities into the relativistic KE equation to find the actual KE.

But that's not correct because in reality, the velocities are different due to the relativistic momentum.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the ratio of kinetic energies.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, K1 =1 GeV, K2=2 GeV. So K1/K2=1/2.

In the relativistic case, what would be the ratio?

Wait, but without knowing the velocities, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the total KE is 3 GeV, and the ratio of the masses is 2:1.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of energy partitioning in inelastic collisions. In the center of mass frame, the kinetic energy is shared based on mass ratios. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem in terms of the velocity of the center of mass. Wait, but in this case, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the center of mass frame is the same as the initial frame.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v and (2v), since in the non-relativistic case, the lighter fragment moves twice as fast. Wait, no, earlier in the non-relativistic case, m1=2m2, so m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2= 2 v1. So for m1, velocity is v1, for m2, velocity is 2 v1.

But in the relativistic case, the relation between v1 and v2 would be different.

Wait, perhaps I can write the momentum equation as gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But I don't know how to relate v1 and v2 without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps I can denote v1 as x c, and v2 as y c. Then, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 -x²), gamma2=1/sqrt(1 - y²).

So, equation (1): (gamma1 m1 x) = (gamma2 m2 y).

Equation (2): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

Hmm, this might be a system of equations that can be solved numerically.

But without a calculator, this might be tough. Alternatively, perhaps I can make an approximation.

Let me assume that beta1 is much smaller than 1. So, gamma1≈1 + (1/2) x², where x=beta1.

Similarly, gamma2 is not necessarily small, so perhaps I can't approximate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the more massive fragment has a low velocity, so gamma1 is close to 1. Then, equation (2) becomes 2(1) + gamma2 ≈3.0303 → gamma2 ≈1.0303.

So gamma2 ≈1.0303 implies that beta2 is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2²)) ) → sqrt(1 - (1/(1.0303)^2)).

Calculating 1.0303 squared: approximately 1.0615. So 1/1.0615 ≈0.942. So 1 -0.942=0.058. So beta2= sqrt(0.058)≈0.24.

So beta2≈0.24, which is about 24% of the speed of light. That's significant, but perhaps manageable.

So, with gamma2≈1.0303, and beta2≈0.24, let's plug into equation (1):

gamma1 m1 x = gamma2 m2 y.

But m1 =2 m2, so:

gamma1 (2 m2) x = gamma2 m2 y → 2 gamma1 x = gamma2 y.

Since gamma1 is ≈1, and gamma2≈1.0303, and assuming x is small, since gamma1≈1, we have:

2 x = 1.0303 y → y ≈ (2/1.0303) x ≈1.94 x.

So y ≈1.94 x.

But from equation (2), gamma2 ≈1.0303.

So, with y≈1.94 x, and beta2 = y ≈0.24, so x ≈ y /1.94 ≈0.24/1.94 ≈0.1237.

So, beta1≈0.1237, so gamma1≈1/sqrt(1 - (0.1237)^2 ) ≈1/sqrt(1-0.0153) ≈1/sqrt(0.9847) ≈1.0078.

So, gamma1≈1.0078.

So, let's plug these into equation (2):

2 gamma1 + gamma2 ≈ 2*(1.0078) +1.0303 ≈2.0156 +1.0303=3.0459.

But equation (2) requires 3.0303, so a bit off. Hmm, perhaps my assumption that gamma1 is approximately 1 is not accurate enough.

Let me see, the actual equation (2) is 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

If I take gamma2=1.0303, then 2 gamma1 =3.0303 -1.0303=2 → gamma1=1.

But we found gamma1≈1.0078, which gives a higher value. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume gamma1 is 1 but instead treat equation (2) as 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

But without knowing gamma2, perhaps I can express gamma2 from equation (2):

gamma2 =3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

Then, substitute into equation (1):

2 gamma1 beta1 = (3.0303 -2 gamma1) beta2.

But I don't know beta2 in terms of beta1. Hmm.

Wait, let me try to express beta2 as y = (2 gamma1 beta1)/(3.0303 - 2 gamma1).

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps I can make an iterative approach.

Let me assume gamma1 is 1, so gamma2=1.0303.

Then, beta2= sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2^2))= sqrt(1 - (1/(1.0303)^2)).

1.0303^2 is about 1.0615, so 1/1.0615≈0.942. So 1 -0.942=0.058. sqrt(0.058)= ~0.24.

So beta2 ≈0.24.

Then, equation (1): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2 → 2 *1 * beta1 =1.0303 *0.24 → beta1= (1.0303 *0.24)/2 ≈ 0.1236.

So beta1≈0.1236, gamma1=1/sqrt(1 -0.1236^2)= 1/sqrt(1-0.01527)=1/sqrt(0.98473)= ~1.0078.

Now, what is gamma1? 1.0078.

So with gamma1=1.0078, equation (2) gives gamma2=3.0303 - 2*1.0078=3.0303 -2.0156=1.0147.

So gamma2=1.0147. Then, beta2= sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2^2))= sqrt(1 -1/(1.0147)^2)= sqrt(1 -1/(1.0298))=sqrt(1-0.9707)=sqrt(0.0293)= ~0.171.

Wait, so beta2 is now 0.171.

So, equation (1): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

gamma1 is 1.0078, gamma2=1.0147.

So,

2 *1.0078 * beta1 =1.0147 *0.171.

Compute RHS: 1.0147 *0.171 ≈0.1735.

So, beta1 = 0.1735/(2*1.0078) ≈0.1735/(2.0156 )≈0.086.

So beta1≈0.086.

Then, gamma1=1/sqrt(1 -0.086^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.007396)=1/sqrt(0.9926)=~1.0037.

Then, equation (2): gamma2=3.0303 -2*1.0037=3.0303 -2.0074=1.0229.

So gamma2=1.0229.

Beta2= sqrt(1 - (1/(1.0229^2)) )= sqrt(1 -1/(1.0465))=sqrt(1-0.956)=sqrt(0.044)= ~0.21.

So equation (1): 2 gamma1 beta1=gamma2 beta2.

gamma1=1.0037, beta1= ?

RHS: gamma2 beta2=1.0229 *0.21≈0.2148.

So,

2*1.0037* beta1=0.2148 → beta1=0.2148/(2.0074)≈0.107.

Now, compute gamma1=1/sqrt(1 -0.107^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.0114)=1/sqrt(0.9886)= ~1.0055.

Equation (2): gamma2=3.0303 -2*1.0055=3.0303-2.011=1.0193.

So beta2= sqrt(1-1/(1.0193)^2 )= sqrt(1-1/1.0389)=sqrt(1-0.9628)=sqrt(0.0372)= ~0.193.

Now, equation (1): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

gamma1=1.0055, gamma2=1.0193.

So,

2 *1.0055 * beta1 =1.0193 *0.193.

RHS: 1.0193 *0.193≈0.196.

So beta1=0.196/(2*1.0055)=0.196/(2.011)= ~0.0975.

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 -0.0975^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.0095)=1/sqrt(0.9905)= ~1.0048.

Equation (2): gamma2=3.0303 -2*1.0048=3.0303 -2.0096=1.0207.

Beta2= sqrt(1 -1/gamma2^2)= sqrt(1-1/(1.0207)^2)=sqrt(1-1/1.0419)=sqrt(0.9405)= ~0.97.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1.0207^2=1.0419, so 1/1.0419≈0.9608. So 1-0.9608=0.0392. sqrt(0.0392)= ~0.198.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute gamma2=1.0207. Then:

gamma2^2=1.0207^2≈1.0419.

1/gamma2^2≈0.9608.

So 1 - 0.9608=0.0392. sqrt(0.0392)= ~0.198.

So beta2=0.198.

Equation (1): 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

gamma1=1.0048, beta1= ?

RHS: 1.0207 *0.198≈0.2018.

So, 2 *1.0048 * beta1 =0.2018 → beta1=0.2018/(2.0096)≈0.1004.

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 - (0.1004)^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.01008)=1/sqrt(0.9899)=~1.005.

Equation (2): gamma2=3.0303 -2*(1.005)=3.0303 -2.01=1.0203.

Beta2= sqrt(1 - (1/(1.0203)^2))= sqrt(1 - 1/1.0412)= sqrt(1-0.9608)= sqrt(0.0392)= ~0.198.

So, equation (1): 2*1.005*beta1=1.0203 *0.198.

RHS: 1.0203 *0.198≈0.2016.

So beta1=0.2016/(2*1.005)=0.2016/(2.01)= ~0.0999.

gamma1=1/sqrt(1- (0.0999)^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.00998)=1/sqrt(0.99002)=~1.005.

So, I think the values are converging.

So, approximately:

gamma1≈1.005, gamma2≈1.020.

beta1≈0.0999 (≈0.1), beta2≈0.198.

So, KE for fragment 1 (m1=2m) is:

K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

m1 c²=2m c²= 2*(0.33 M c²) )= 2*(0.33 *300 GeV)=198 GeV.

So,

K1= (1.005 -1) * 198 GeV =0.005 *198 =0.99 GeV≈1 GeV.

Wait, that's interesting. So the relativistic KE is about 1 GeV, similar to the non-relativistic case. So the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 would be small, around 0.99 GeV? But wait, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, but the options are in the range of a few MeV.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, m1 is 0.66 M. So m1 c² is 0.66 * 300 GeV =198 GeV.

So K1 is (gamma1 -1)* m1 c².

gamma1 is about 1.005, so (gamma1-1)=0.005.

So K1=0.005 *198=0.99 GeV, which is about 990 MeV. But the non-relativistic calculation also gave K1=1 GeV. So the difference is about 0.99 GeV -1 GeV = -0.01 GeV, which is -10 MeV. But since the question is about the absolute difference, it would be ~10 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the non-relativistic case gave K1=1 GeV, the relativistic case gives K1=0.99 GeV. So the correct T1 is less than the classical T1? How?

Wait, that can't be, because in the non-relativistic case, we used (1/2) m v², which would be an underestimate for higher velocities. So why is the relativistic T1 less than the non-relativistic?

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Because if v is higher, the relativistic KE should be higher than the non-relativistic.

Wait, let me think about this. For a given velocity v, the relativistic KE is (gamma -1) m c², which is larger than the non-relativistic KE (1/2 m v²) when v is a significant fraction of c.

But in our calculation here, using the approximate gamma1=1.005, the relativistic KE is 0.99 GeV, which is just under the non-relativistic 1 GeV. But that doesn't make sense because for v=0.1c, the relativistic KE is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me compute the non-relativistic K1 and the relativistic K1 for beta1=0.1.

Wait, beta1=0.1 → v=0.1c.

Non-relativistic KE: (1/2) m1 v² = 0.5 * (0.66 M) (0.1c)^2.

But M c²=300 GeV, so M=300 GeV/c².

So,

0.5 *0.66 * (300 GeV/c²) * (0.01 c²) )= 0.5 *0.66 *300 *0.01 GeV = 0.5 *0.66 *3 GeV =0.5 *1.98 GeV=0.99 GeV.

So the non-relativistic K1 is 0.99 GeV? But earlier, I thought it was 1 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the non-relativistic calculation.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the velocities were v1 and 2v1 for the two fragments.

So, earlier calculation:

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2=2v1.

Each fragment's KE is (1/2) m v².

So,

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1².

K2 = (1/2) m2 (2v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

But m1=2 m2 → m2= m1/2.

So,

K1= 0.5 m1 v1².

K2=2*(m1/2) v1²= m1 v1².

So K1 + K2= 1.5 m1 v1².

We know K1 + K2=3 GeV.

So,

1.5 m1 v1²=3 GeV → m1 v1²=2 GeV.

But m1 c² = 198 GeV.

So,

v1²= 2 GeV/(m1) = 2 GeV/(0.66 *300 GeV/c²) )= 2/(0.66 *300 GeV) * c² → wait, units may not be right.

Alternatively, m1 v1²=2 GeV → v1²=2 GeV / (m1 c²) * c².

But m1 c² is 198 GeV, so v1²=2/(198) c² → v1= c * sqrt(2/198)= c * sqrt(1/99)≈0.1 c.

So, v1=0.1c.

Thus, K1=0.5 * m1 v1² =0.5 * (198 GeV/c²) * (0.01 c²) )=0.5 *198 *0.01 GeV=0.99 GeV.

Ah! So the non-relativistic KE is 0.99 GeV, not 1 GeV as I thought earlier. So the correct T1 is (gamma1 -1)m1 c², which is (1.005-1)*198=0.99 GeV, which is the same as the non-relativistic case.

Wait, that's strange. So the correct T1 is about 0.99 GeV, which is the same as the non-relativistic case. So the difference is zero? But that can't be right.

Wait, no. Because in reality, the velocities are different. Because in the non-relativistic case, we calculated v1 as 0.1c, but in reality, the velocity is different.

Wait, no, in the non-relativistic case, I calculated v1 as 0.1c, but when I plugged in the velocities into the relativistic KE, I got the same result as the non-relativistic case.

But that can't be correct. Because, in reality, the velocities are not v1=0.1c, but a different value.

Wait, let me recast this.

In the non-relativistic case, m1 is 0.66M, m2 is 0.33M.

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2 → 0.66M v1=0.33M v2 → v2=2v1.

Kinetic energies: K1=0.5 *0.66M v1², K2=0.5 *0.33M (2 v1)^2=0.5 *0.33M *4 v1²=0.66 M v1².

So K1=0.33 M v1², K2=0.66 M v1². Sum K1+K2=0.99 M v1²=3 GeV.

So, 0.99 M v1²=3 GeV.

But M c²=300 GeV.

So, M=300 GeV/c².

Thus,

0.99 * (300 GeV/c²) *v1²=3 GeV → v1²= (3 GeV) / (0.99 *300 GeV/c²) ) * c².

Wait, units:

v1² = (3 GeV) / (0.99 *300 GeV/c²) ) * c² → (3) / (297) ) * c² → 1/99 c² → v1= c/√99≈0.1c.

So, K1=0.33 M v1²=0.33*(300 GeV/c²) * (0.01 c²)=0.33 *3 GeV=1 GeV.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave K1=0.99 GeV. Now, it's 1 GeV.

So perhaps I made a mistake before. Let me recalculate.

In the non-relativistic case:

m1=0.66M, m2=0.33M.

v2=2 v1.

So,

K1 = 0.5 *0.66 M v1².

K2=0.5 *0.33 M (2 v1)^2 =0.5 *0.33 M *4 v1²=0.66 M v1².

So,

K1=0.33 M v1²,

K2=0.66 M v1².

Sum K1 +K2=0.99 M v1²=3 GeV.

So,

M v1² =3 GeV/(0.99) ≈3.0303 GeV.

But M c²=300 GeV → M=300 GeV/c².

So,

v1²= 3.0303 GeV / M = (3.0303 GeV) / (300 GeV/c² ))= (3.0303/300) c² → 0.0101 c².

v1= sqrt(0.0101) c ≈0.1005 c.

So,

v1≈0.1005 c.

Thus,

K1=0.33 * M *v1² =0.33*(300 GeV/c²)*(0.0101 c²)=0.33 *3.03 GeV= ~1 GeV.

So, in the non-relativistic case, K1=1 GeV.

Now, the relativistic calculation gave K1≈0.99 GeV, which is just slightly less than 1 GeV.

Wait, but that can't be right because the relativistic KE must be higher for the same velocity.

Wait, no, perhaps because in the relativistic case, the actual velocity is lower than the non-relativistic assumption. Because in the non-relativistic case, you're assuming a velocity of about 0.1c, but perhaps in reality, the velocity is lower due to the increased momentum from relativity.

Wait, because in the relativistic case, the same momentum requires higher energy, so perhaps the velocity is lower.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the velocity is v1=0.1005c, and in the relativistic case, it's lower. So the relativistic KE would be lower than the non-relativistic.

But that would mean the correct T1 is lower than the classical T1. But that's counterintuitive because for the same velocity, the relativistic KE is higher than the non-relativistic.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the non-relativistic calculation overestimates the velocity. Because in reality, the velocity is lower, so the KE is lower.

In any case, the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 is about 1 GeV -0.99 GeV≈0.01 GeV =10 MeV.

But wait, according to the relativistic calculation, T1 is approximately 0.99 GeV, which is 990 MeV. The classical T1 is 1 GeV (1000 MeV). So the difference is 10 MeV.

So the correct answer is C) 10 MeV.

Wait, but the question says "the difference between the correct T1 and T1 calculated using classical approximation." So if correct T1 is lower, the difference would be negative, but the options are positive. So perhaps the correct answer is 10 MeV, so option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using both relativistic and non-relativistic approximations. The atomic nucleus of mass \( M \) at rest undergoes fission into two fragments with rest-mass energies \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2m_2 \). The total rest-mass energy of the fragments is \( 0.99Mc^2 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), leaving \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) of energy as the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

### Key Steps:
1. **Rest Mass Distribution**:  
   Let \( m_2 = x \). Then \( m_1 = 2x \), and \( m_1 + m_2 = 3x = 0.99M \).  
   Solving gives \( x = 0.33M \), so \( m_1 = 0.66M \) and \( m_2 = 0.33M \).

2. **Non-Relativistic Case**:  
   Using classical mechanics, momentum conservation gives \( m_1v_1 = m_2v_2 \). Substituting \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), we find \( v_2 = 2v_1 \).  
   The kinetic energies are:  
   \[
   K_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2, \quad K_2 = \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2.
   \]  
   Substituting \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), we get \( K_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( K_2 = 2 \, \text{GeV} \), consistent with the total kinetic energy \( K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Relativistic Case**:  
   In the relativistic regime, the total energy conservation equation is:  
   \[
   \gamma_1m_1c^2 + \gamma_2m_2c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]  
   Momentum conservation gives:  
   \[
   \gamma_1m_1v_1 = \gamma_2m_2v_2.
   \]  
   Solving these equations numerically, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment \( T_1 \) is found to be approximately \( 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \).

4. **Difference Between Relativistic and Classical \( T_1 \)**:  
   The classical \( T_1 \) is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \), and the relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta T_1 = |T_1^{\text{relativistic}} - T_1^{\text{classical}}| = |0.99 - 1| = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The difference between the correct relativistic \( T_1 \) and the classical \( T_1 \) is \( 10 \, \text{MeV} \).
