Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given as A to D, and I need to find which one is correct.

Hmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator gives the average measurement outcome if you measured that observable many times on the same state. So, for a given operator O, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

The operator here is 10σz +5σx. So, I can break this down into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx. Then add them together.

Wait, because expectation values are linear. So, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes sense. So I can compute each expectation separately.

First, let me find the state vector. The state is given as ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me represent this as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is typically (1, 0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), ψ would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Let me check the normalization: |0.5|^2 + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Yep, it's normalized.

Now, the operator σz is diagonal because its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So σz|↑⟩ = 1|↑⟩, σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So, the expectation value of σz for this state is just the probability of |↑⟩ minus the probability of |↓⟩. Wait, because eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. The probabilities are their squares. So probability of |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Probability of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that part.

Next, the σx operator. Oh, σx is the Pauli x-matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its expectation value is a bit trickier because it's not diagonal in the σz basis.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me compute that. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and the conjugate transpose is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)*]. Since the coefficients are real here, it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, when I multiply σx with |ψ⟩, I get [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2), (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) ] = [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

Then, the inner product with ψ is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. Hmm, wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, wait, no. The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you apply it to the vector [a, b], it becomes [b, a]. So, σx |ψ⟩ = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, the inner product is ψ† (σx |ψ⟩) = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5). So each term
