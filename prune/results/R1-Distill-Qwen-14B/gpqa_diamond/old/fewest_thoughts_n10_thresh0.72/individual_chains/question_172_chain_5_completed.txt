Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me think.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, right, when they say the atoms are more excited, that probably refers to their energy levels. So if something is twice as excited, maybe the number of atoms in that energy level is higher. Oh wait, no, wait—excitation in terms of energy or excitation in terms of population? I think it's about the population. So the population of the specific energy level is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, because in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels depends on the temperature. So this is probably related to the Boltzmann distribution.

Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So the formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (kT) )

In this case, star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited. Wait, I think that means the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So let me define the two energy levels as level E_upper and E_lower. But wait, the problem says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So that's E_upper - E_lower = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, but for the Boltzmann factor, we take the ratio of the upper state to the lower state. So for each star, the ratio would be given by their respective temperatures.

Let me denote n_1 as the population of the excited state in star_1, and n_2 as the same in star_2. According to the problem, n_1 = 2 * n_2.

Wait no, wait. Oh wait, perhaps I got that backwards. The problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So for the same energy level, star_1 has more atoms in that level than star_2. So n_1_upper / n_1_lower = (something), and n_2_upper / n_2_lower = something else. But perhaps the question is comparing the same level between the two stars.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio n_upper / n_lower is being compared between the two stars. So for star_1, the ratio is R1, and for star_2, it's R2.

Wait, but the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. I'm not entirely clear on what that means. Does it mean that the number of excited atoms is twice as much? Or that the average energy is twice as high?

Wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." Oh, perhaps it refers to the fraction of atoms in that specific excited energy level. So if star_1 has twice the fraction of atoms in that energy level compared to star_2. But how does that fit into the Boltzmann equation?

Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) that's considered. Let's say for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) to those in the lower state (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So how does that translate into the ratio? Oh, perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same level. So n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2.

Wait, but that would require knowing how the number of atoms in the lower state compares. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of the upper to lower states between the two stars.

Wait, maybe the problem is that each star has a different ratio of upper to lower states. So for star_1, R1 = (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

For star_2, R2 = (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 in that specific level. So n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2.

Wait, but the lower states could be different as well. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the ratio of the two ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that for a given energy level, the fraction of atoms in that level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, but that's not exactly how the Boltzmann distribution works. Because the population depends on both the ratio and the total number of atoms.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. The problem states that the excitation is twice as much. Assuming that this is the ratio of the populations in the same energy level between the two stars.

So, n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2 / 1 ?

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the way I should interpret it is that the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same level.

But in that case, the populations would depend on the number of atoms (which would be higher in a brighter star), but perhaps the question is about the ratio per unit, like per total number of atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is comparing the excitation potential, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1, that ratio is R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So I'm not sure what that implies for R1 and R2.

Wait, if the atoms are twice as excited in star_1, perhaps that means that the ratio R1 is twice R2? Or is it that R1 is half of R2?

Wait, let me think about what the ratio represents. If R is higher, it means more atoms are in the upper energy level compared to the lower one. So a higher R implies more excitation because more atoms are in the higher energy state.

So if star_1 has a higher R than star_2, that would mean the excitation is higher, so more excited.

In the problem, star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So perhaps R1 is twice R2.

Wait, but the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2.

Wait, but the number of atoms in the upper state could depend on the total number of atoms. Maybe the question is actually referring to the ratio of the upper to lower states, R, and R1 is twice R2. No, that can't be because R1 and R2 are both functions of temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should take another angle. Let's denote the populations.

Assume that the energy levels are E_upper and E_lower, with ΔE = E_upper - E_lower =1.38e-23 J.

The Boltzmann factor for each star is:

For star 1: n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) → R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2: R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Maybe this refers to the ratio of the upper to lower states being twice. So R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, if R1 = 2 R2, then:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is proportional to the fraction of atoms in the upper level. So the fraction in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

The fraction of atoms in the upper level is n_upper / (n_upper + n_lower) = [R]/(R +1 )

So for star 1: f1 = R1/(1 + R1 )

For star 2: f2 = R2/(1 + R2 )

And f1 = 2 f2

So,

R1/(1 + R1 ) = 2 * [ R2/(1 + R2 ) ]

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Let me think if there's another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is stating that the ratio of the populations in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, but earlier I thought R1 would be higher, so that would imply that star_1 is hotter because higher R (more population in upper level) would happen at higher temperatures, since the exponential becomes less negative as T increases.

Wait, let me think about the exponential function: exp( -x ) increases as x decreases. So when T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases. So higher T → higher R (ratio of upper to lower states).

So if star_1 has higher excitation than star_2 (more in upper state), then R1 > R2, implying T1 > T2.

But the question states that star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps R1 = 2 R2.

So,

R1 = 2 R2

But R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2 )

But ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, let me compute it.

But perhaps I can relate it to the temperatures. Let's rewrite the equation:

(ΔE / k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

Hmm, but I don't know the value of k, but perhaps I can reorganize the equation in terms of T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it in terms of (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is a common term in such equations.

Let me see:

(ΔE / k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

Because:

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

(ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But the question is asking about which equation is correct for the effective temperatures. The options are all ln(2) equals some expression without ΔE or k. So perhaps the correct equation is:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but in our equation, it's (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2).

So unless (ΔE/(k)) is equal to 1, which I don't think it is, but let's compute it.

Wait, what is ΔE? It's 1.38e-23 J.

Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k * T, so when ΔE = k * T, then T = ΔE /k.

Wait, no. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Oh! So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back into our equation:

(1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / 1 K

But since the equation is in terms of temperatures, the units must work out. Wait, but (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) is unit-less because (K - K) / (K * K) ) → K/(K^2) → 1/K. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So plugging back into the equation:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but the left-hand side has units of K*(1/(K^2)) ) → 1/K.

Wait, but the right-hand side is ln(2 ), which is unit-less.

Hmm, that suggests I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have started with the ratio of the populations. Let me go back.

The problem says the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2.

But n_upper is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So if the total number of atoms is the same for both stars, then (n_upper1)/(n_upper2) = (R1)/(R2) ) = 2.

Wait, but R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So (R1/R2) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

So,

exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2 )

Again, since ΔE/(k) = 1 K,

1 K * [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2 )

But 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 ) / 1 K

Wait, but units on the left are (K - K)/(K * K ) = (K)/(K^2) ) → 1/K.

But the right-hand side is ln(2 ) / (1 K ) → same as 1/K.

So the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )/ (1 K )

But wait, the question is about the relation between T1 and T2, without involving ΔE or k. But in the setup, we've used that ΔE/(k )=1 K, which is a specific value. So the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Because 1 K on the right would cancel out with the 1 K on the left (since the left is in units of 1/K, same as the right). Wait, but this seems a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is ln(2 ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2 ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches what we have here.

So the correct equation is ln(2 ) = (T1 - T2 )/(T1 T2 )

So the answer should be option D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

In LTE, the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Assuming this refers to the population ratio, we have:

\[
R_1 = 2 R_2.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Using the fact that \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (since \( \Delta E / k = 1 \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options do not align with the derived relationship between \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \).
