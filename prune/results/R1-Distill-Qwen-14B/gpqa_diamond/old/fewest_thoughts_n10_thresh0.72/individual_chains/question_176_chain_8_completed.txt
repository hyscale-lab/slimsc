Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that's three components. So maybe it's a three-dimensional system? Or perhaps it's a vector in a 3D space. Oh right, quantum states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, so this must be a 3-level system or something like that.

Then, there are two operators, P and Q. The matrix for P is given. First row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Matrix for Q is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". So the sequence is P first, then Q. But wait, when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, you measure Q on that new state.

Wait, but the problem asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the combined probability of P being 0 and then Q being -1.

Wait, but perhaps that's not the correct approach. Let me think. When you measure P first, the state collapses to an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, when you measure Q, you get an eigenvalue of Q, which in this case, the possible eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So the second measurement is on the state after the first measurement, which is an eigenstate of P.

But wait, I'm not sure I'm getting this right. Maybe I should approach it differently: find the probabilities step by step.

First, I'll need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state collapses into that eigenvector.

So, the operator P is given as:

[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Let's find the eigenvalues first. The eigenvalues are solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Hmm, the matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]
[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)]
[0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Calculating the determinant: 

det(P - λ I) = -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * something.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute using the rule for 3x3 determinants. Alternatively, perhaps P has a specific structure that can help. Let's see:

Looking at P, it's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. 

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix has a specific pattern. Let me see: the first row has 0 in the first element, 1/sqrt(2) in the second, 0 in third. The second row has 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row same as first? Wait, no, third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], same as the first. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, perhaps the matrix has a particular symmetry. Let me think about the eigenvectors. Maybe the eigenvectors are along certain axes, like (1,0,1) or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for eigenvectors by solving (P - λ I)v = 0.

Let's try for λ = 0.

Wait, but I'm looking for the eigenvalue 0. So let me check if the vector (a, b, c) is an eigenvector with λ=0.

So, (P)(v) = λ v → P v = 0.

So,

Row 1: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0*c = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) b = 0 → b = 0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) a + 0*b + (1/sqrt(2)) c = 0 → a + c = 0 → a = -c.

Row 3: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0*c = 0 → same as row 1, which gives b=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where b=0 and a = -c. So any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) is an eigenvector for λ=0. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait, no, because for λ=0, the equations are rank 2, so the nullspace is one-dimensional? Wait, let me check the rank.

Wait, the matrix P for λ=0 is:

[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Let me see the rows:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Looking at row 3, it's the same as row 1. So the rank is 2, because rows 1 and 2 are independent. So the nullspace is 3-2=1, so only one eigenvector for λ=0.

Wait, no, wait. Because when λ=0, the matrix P - 0 I is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Looking for vectors v such that P v = 0. So, the equations are:

Equation 1: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2 =0.

Equation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Equation 3: (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → same as equation 1, so v2=0.

So the vector v must satisfy v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So any vector (a, 0, -a) is in the nullspace. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Wait, but wait, that's only one vector. So when you measure P, the possible eigenvalues are 0, and the other eigenvalues. Wait, but let me think, P is a 3x3 matrix, so it should have three eigenvalues. So λ=0 is one of them, and the others are found from the other roots.

But perhaps for the problem, only the eigenvalue 0 is relevant because we're looking for the case where P is measured as 0.

So, the initial state is the vector (-1, 2, 1). Let's write that as a column vector:

v = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized. Let me check the norm of the state. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. But perhaps the problem doesn't require normalization, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, when you measure an observable, the probability is the square of the amplitude, so perhaps the state is considered as a vector, regardless of normalization.

But maybe the state is already normalized. Let me compute: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 =1+4+1=6. So the length is sqrt(6). So to normalize, we have to divide each component by sqrt(6).

But I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Let me proceed.

When you measure P, the possible eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of P. And for each eigenvalue λ_p, the probability is the square of the inner product between the state and the eigenvector of P corresponding to λ_p.

But wait, for our case, we're interested in the case where P is measured to be 0. So the state after measurement is the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0, normalized. The eigenvectors are in the nullspace of P (λ=0), which is (a, 0, -a) as vectors. So the normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) ), because (1,0,-1) has length sqrt(1+0+1)=sqrt(2), so when normalized, each component is 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, because (1,0,-1) has length sqrt(1+0+1) = sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))).

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is u = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Now, the initial state is v = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. But wait, no, the initial state as given is the column matrix (-1, 2, 1), but perhaps it's already a state vector. But I'm not sure if it's normalized. Let's compute the inner product between the initial state and the eigenvector u.

The amplitude is the inner product of v and u. Since v is given as (-1,2,1), perhaps I should use that vector as is, or maybe it's the unnormalized vector. Alternatively, perhaps the state is already normalized, in which case I should take v as ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the initial state as a vector, and the probabilities are based on the inner product with each eigenvector, squared. So perhaps I should normalize the initial state.

Let me proceed this way: the initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

So when you measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector of P for λ=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is |u> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So the inner product <u | ψ> is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.

Wait wait, no. Wait, |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

So <u | ψ> is [ 1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ] · [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

So this is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Simplify each term:

First term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third term: (-1)*(1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So total is [ (-1) + (-1) ] / (2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

Wait, but wait: [1/sqrt(2)] * (-1/sqrt(6)) = -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2 sqrt(3)).

Similarly, [ -1/sqrt(2) ] * [1/sqrt(6) ] = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2 sqrt(3)).

So adding them together: (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) + 0 + (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) ) = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the inner product is (-1)/sqrt(3).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (1/3).

So the probability of P being 0 is 1/3.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The initial state is |ψ> = 1/sqrt(6) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

The eigenvector for λ=0 is |u> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Which is [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ].

So that's (-1 -1) / (sqrt(12)) ) → (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) → (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the amplitude is (-1)/sqrt(3), and the probability is [ (-1/sqrt(3)) ]^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector |u>, which is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Now, we need to measure Q on this new state.

The operator Q is diagonal: [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,-1]]. So the eigenvalues are 1 (with eigenvector [1,0,0]), 0 (with eigenvectors any vector in the y-direction, like [0,1,0]), and -1 (with eigenvector [0,0,1]).

So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.

We're interested in the outcome Q=-1. So what is the probability when we measure Q on the state |u>?

The state |u> is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

The eigenvector for Q=-1 is |q-1> = [0,0,1]^T.

The inner product between |u> and |q-1> is [1/sqrt(2)] * 0 + 0 * 0 + [ -1/sqrt(2) ] * 1 = -1/sqrt(2).

The amplitude is -1/sqrt(2), so the probability is ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.

Wait, but wait: the state |u> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the third component is the amplitude for the Q=-1 eigenstate. So the probability is ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

Wait, but wait. The state |u> is already the result of the first measurement, so when we measure Q, the probabilities are based on the components of |u> in the eigenbasis of Q.

So the probability for Q=-1 is the square of the absolute value of the third component of |u>, which is ( -1/sqrt(2) )^2 = 1/2.

So now, the combined probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0.

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you measure P and get 0, the state becomes |u>, which is the eigenvector of P for 0. Then, when you measure Q on |u>, the probability of getting -1 is 1/2.

So the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

So the answer should be D) 1/6.


The problem involves a quantum system with a given state vector and two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to find the probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in successive measurements.

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, solve \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is found by solving \( (P - 0I)v = 0 \), leading to the eigenvector:

\[
|u\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Initial State
The initial state is given as \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The norm is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the inner product between \( | \psi \rangle \) and the eigenvector \( |u\rangle \). Compute:

\[
\langle u | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle u | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State After \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( |u\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 5: Measurement of \( Q \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors \( |q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |q_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), respectively.

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the inner product between \( |u\rangle \) and \( |q_{-1}\rangle \):

\[
\langle q_{-1} | u \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q=-1) = \left| \langle q_{-1} | u \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Combined Probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in successive measurements is:

**Answer: D**
