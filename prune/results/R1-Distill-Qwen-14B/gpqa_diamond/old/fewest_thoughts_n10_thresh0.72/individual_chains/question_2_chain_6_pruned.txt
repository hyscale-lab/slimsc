Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. The steps are:

1. Trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.
2. Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.
3. Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

We need to find how many carbon atoms are in product 3.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, what's trans-cinnamaldehyde? Oh right, trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached at one end, and a double bond (the cinnamyl part) in the middle. The structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CHO if it's cinnamaldehyde, but wait, wait. No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually the aldehyde with the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, noâ€”that's not right. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic compound where the aldehyde is attached to a propene chain. So it's benzaldehyde with a double bond. So, the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait. No, wait, wait. Let me think: Cinnamaldehyde is benzene ring connected to a CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no. Wait, no: (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no. Wait, no. Let me get this right. The structure of cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH=CH-CHO? No, wait. No, wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? Oh wait, no, that's not correct. I think I'm confusing it with another compound. Let me draw it mentally. Cinnamaldehyde has the structure where the aldehyde group is on the end of a propene chain attached to the benzene ring.
