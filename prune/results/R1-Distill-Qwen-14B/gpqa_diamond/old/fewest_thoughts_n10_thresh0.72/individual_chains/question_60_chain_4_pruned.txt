Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation happens. But wait, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the aliens are traveling at a speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really, really fast. The spacecraft is moving at that constant speed, so I guess we're dealing with special relativity here. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective.

Wait, the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut." Oh right, that's the proper time. So I should use the time dilation formula to find the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

The formula for time dilation is the proper time (tau) equals the coordinate time (t) multiplied by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). But wait, I think it's actually the other way around. Oh right, the proper time is the shortest time experienced by the traveler, so tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or wait, maybe it's t = tau / sqrt(...). Hmm, maybe I should get the formula right.

Another approach: from the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is length-contracted. So the distance they have to travel is less than what we observe from Earth. So the time they experience is (distance in their frame) divided by their speed.

So first, let's figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, but do we have that data? Oh wait, the problem doesn't provide the distance. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I miss something?

Wait, maybe the lifetime of the aliens is given, 150 solar years. Oh, that's probably the average lifetime of the aliens, so the astronaut is 22 and the average is 150, so maybe the astronaut can live longer than 150 years? Or perhaps the trip takes longer than that, and the astronaut might not survive.

Wait, no, the astronaut is 22 years old,
