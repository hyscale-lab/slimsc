Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about binary star systems, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The problem says there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, from spectroscopic observations, the radial velocity (RV) variations for each system are given. System_1 has amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s, while system_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The masses are the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm. I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity curves can tell us about the masses of the stars. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's moving less due to the gravitational pull of the system. Wait, Newton's third law of motion, right? For a binary system, the two stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, so its velocity is lower. So the primary eclipse occurs when the brighter star (which is usually the more massive one) is in front of the dimmer star.

Wait, but in this problem, the RV amplitudes are given. RV amplitude is the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve. So the formula I think is involved here relates the velocities of the stars to their masses. The mass function comes into play, but I'm not exactly sure how.

Wait, the mass function for a spectroscopic binary is given by:

f(M) = (v² * P) / (2πG)

But wait, that's probably for a single-lined spectroscopic binary. In this problem, both systems are probably double-lined because both stars' velocities are measured.

Wait, okay, for a double-lined binary, the velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

But wait, the mass function actually relates the velocity semi-amplitude to the mass ratio. Alternatively, the total mass can be found using the orbital period and the velocities.

Wait, the formula for the total mass of the binary system is M = (4π²/G) * (a1 + a2)³/(P²), but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, I think the relation between the velocities and the masses is that the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass: M1/M2 = V2/V1.

Because the stars orbit the center of mass, so M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. And since velocity v = 2πa / P, so a is proportional to v * P / (2π). So substituting, M1 * (v1 * P / 2π) = M2 * (v2 * P / 2π). The P and 2π cancel out, so M1 v1 = M2 v2. So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

Wait, so the mass ratio is the inverse of the velocity ratio. So if in system 1, velocities are 10 and 5, then the mass ratio M1/M2 is (5)/(10) = 0.5.

Similarly, in system 2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

But wait, in each system, the velocities are given as the two amplitudes. So for each system, we have two velocities, K1 and K2. So the mass ratio is K2/K1.

Wait, let me be precise. Let me denote the stars in each system as M1 and M2. In system 1, the RV amplitudes are K1=10 and K2=5. So M1 is the star with velocity K1, M2 with K2? Or is it the other way around? Because in a binary system, the more massive star would have a smaller velocity. So if K1 is larger, then M1 is less massive than M2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1. So for system 1, M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass of M2 is twice that of M1. So the total mass of system 1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, in system 2, the velocities are K1=15 and K2=10. So M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M2 = (3/2) M1. So the total mass is M1 + (3/2) M1 = (5/2) M1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about which velocity corresponds to which mass. Let me think again. The more massive star should have a smaller velocity. So for system 1, the star with velocity 10 is less massive than the one with 5? No, that can't be. Wait, because if M1 is the more massive star, then its velocity should be smaller. So if K1 is 10, which is larger than K2=5, then M1 (the star with K1=10) must be less massive than M2 (with K2=5). Because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, and a1 = (v1 * P)/(2π). So higher velocity implies a larger orbit, which means lower mass. So M1 (velocity 10) is less massive than M2 (velocity 5). So M1/M2 = (v2)/(v1) = 5/10 = 0.5. So M2 is twice as massive as M1. So system_1's total mass is M_total1 = M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, in system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So the star with K1=15 is less massive than the one with K2=10. So M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M2 = (3/2) M1. So system_2's total mass is M1 + (3/2) M1 = (5/2) M1.

Wait, but in each case, I'm using M1 as the mass of the star with K1. So for system_1: M1 = mass of star with K=10, M2=mass with K=5.

Wait, but when I compute the mass ratio, I think the mass ratio is M2/M1 = K1/K2.

Wait, let's correct that. Let me define q as the mass ratio, q = M2/M1. Then, in a binary system, q = (K1)/(K2). Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. Because M1 a1 = M2 a2, and a = v * P/(2π). So M1 (v1) = M2 (v2). So M1/M2 = v2/v1 → q = M2/M1 = v1/(v2).

Wait, no, wait: M1 * a1 = M2 * a2 → a1/a2 = M2/M1 = q. Since a = v P / (2π), a1/a2 = (v1 P)/(2π) / (v2 P)/(2π) ) = v1/v2. So v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1 → v1/v2 = q.

So q = v1/v2 = M2/M1.

So for system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So q1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2 → M2 = 2 M1. So system_1's total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

In system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So q2 = K1/K2 =15/10= 1.5. So M2 = 1.5 M1. So system_2's total mass is M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, the two masses are M1 and M2, with K1=15 and K2=10. So according to the formula, q = M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 15/10 = 1.5. So M2 = 1.5 M1. So the total mass is M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but in system_1, M2 is 2 M1, and the total is 3 M1. So, for system_1, M_total1 = 3 M1.

Wait, but we're trying to find the ratio of the total masses. So system_1's mass is 3 M1, and system_2's mass is 2.5 M2, where M2 in system_2 is 1.5 times M1 in system_2.

Wait, no, M1 in system_2 is different from M1 in system_1. Oh wait, no, because each M1 is the mass of one star in each system. So the M1 in system_1 is a different variable than M1 in system_2. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Let me instead think in terms of the total mass of each system.

Wait, maybe I should compute the mass function, which relates the velocities to the masses. The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is:

f(M) = (K² * P) / (294.3) 

Where K is in km/s, P in years, and f(M) is in solar masses. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so maybe I should look for a more precise formula.

Alternatively, the formula for the total mass of a binary system is:

M_total = (4 π²) * (a1 + a2)^3 / (G P²)

But since a1 + a2 is the separation between the two stars, and a1 = (v1 * P)/(2 π), a2 = (v2 * P)/(2 π), so a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) P/(2 π).

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to note that the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = (v1)/(v2).

So for each system, I can compute the mass ratio and then the total mass.

But wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about another approach. Since the orbital period is given for each system, and the velocities are given, maybe I can find the masses using the formula:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² a³) / (G P²)

But a is the separation between the two stars, which is a1 + a2. But a1 is (v1 P)/(2 π), and a2 is (v2 P)/(2 π). So a = (v1 + v2) P/(2 π).

Wait, but then substituting into the mass formula, perhaps I can relate M_total to the velocities and the period.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula that relates the mass function to the velocity semi-amplitudes and period is:

f(M) = ( (K1^3) * P ) / (241 * (1 - e²)^(3/2) )

But for circular orbits, e is zero, so f(M) = (K1³ P) / 241.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the mass function is given by:

f(M) = (K1^3 P) / (241.3) ) 

Which is equal to (M2^3 sin³ i) ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Assuming that the orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), which is the case when eclipses occur because the stars pass in front of each other. So i=90 degrees, so sin i = 1.

So f(M) = (M2³ ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But I don't know M1 or M2 yet, so maybe this isn't the way to go.

Wait, but I'm given both K1 and K2 for each system. So maybe I can find the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2.

Because in system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So q1 = 10/5=2. So M2 is twice M1 in system_1.

In system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So q2=15/10=1.5. So M2 is 1.5 times M1 in system_2.

So for each system, the total mass is M_total = M1 + M2 = M1 (1 + q).

So in system_1, M_total1 = M1(1 + 2) = 3 M1.

In system_2, M_total2 = M1 (1 + 1.5) = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait: the M1 in system_1 is the mass of the star with K=10, and the M1 in system_2 is the mass of the star with K=15. So they're different. So I can't directly compare M1 from system_1 to M1 in system_2.

Hmm, so perhaps I need to find the ratio of the total masses using the velocity amplitudes and the periods.

Wait, another thought: the total mass of the system can be found using the formula:

M_total = (4 π² / G) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P²

But a1 = (v1 * P) / (2 π), and a2 = (v2 * P) / (2 π).

So a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) * P / (2 π)

Substituting into M_total:

M_total = (4 π² / G) * [ (v1 + v2) P/(2 π) ) ]^3 / P²

Simplify:

= (4 π² / G) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³) ) / P²

= (4 π²) * (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³ G) ) * (1/P² )

= (4 π² (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) ) / (8 π³ G P² )

= ( (4 π²) / (8 π³) ) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P^(3-2) / G

= (1/(2 π)) * (v1 + v2)^3 * P / G

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check my math again.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of velocities and period.

Alternatively, I can find a more straightforward formula. I remember that the mass function for each star in a binary system is given by:

f(M) = ( (K * P) ) / (2 π G) ) * ( (K)^2 )

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the variables. Let me think differently.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The sum of their velocities is such that M1 v1 = M2 v2, because M1 a1 = M2 a2. And a1 = v1 * (P/(2 π)), similarly for a2.

So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So, the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = v1/v2.

Now, the total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = M1 (1 + q) = M1 (1 + v1/v2).

But without knowing M1, how can I compare the masses of the two systems?

Wait, but perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

Let me denote:

For system_1:
v1_1 = 10 km/s
v2_1 =5 km/s
q1 = v1_1 / v2_1 = 10/5 = 2
M_total_1 = M1_1 (1 + q1) = M1_1 * 3.

For system_2:
v1_2 =15 km/s
v2_2=10 km/s
q2 = v1_2 / v2_2 =15/10 = 1.5
M_total_2 = M1_2 (1 + q2) = M1_2 * 2.5.

But I need to relate M1_1 and M1_2, the masses of the stars in each system whose velocities are v1.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of M_total_1 to M_total_2.

But how? Because I don't have any other information. Wait, perhaps the orbital period comes into play. The period is the time it takes for the stars to orbit each other. So perhaps the period can be used to find the total mass.

Wait, the formula for the orbital period of a binary system is given by Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² / G M_total) ) * a³

But a is the separation between the stars, which is a1 + a2 = (v1 P/(2 π)) + (v2 P/(2 π)) ) = (v1 + v2) P/(2 π).

So substituting a into Kepler's law:

P² = (4 π² / (G M_total)) * [ (v1 + v2) P/(2 π) ) ]^3

Simplify:

P² = (4 π²) ( (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 ) ) / ( G M_total (8 π^3) ) )

Multiply both sides by G M_total (8 π^3) ) and divide by 4 π²:

P² * G M_total * 8 π^3 / 4 π² = (v1 + v2)^3 P^3

Simplify left side:

(P²) * G M_total * 2 π = (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 )

Divide both sides by P²:

G M_total * 2 π = (v1 + v2)^3 P )

Rearranging for M_total:

M_total = [ (v1 + v2)^3 P ] / (2 π G )

Hmm, that seems manageable.

So M_total is proportional to (v1 + v2)^3 * P / (2 π G )

Wait, but since G is a constant, we can ignore it when taking the ratio between the two systems.

So the ratio of M_total1 to M_total2 would be:

(M_total1)/(M_total2) = [ (v1_1 + v2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (v1_2 + v2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Because G and 2 π are constants and would cancel out.

Let me plug in the numbers.

System_1: v1=10, v2=5 → v_sum =15. P1=2 years.

System_2: v1=15, v2=10 → v_sum=25. P2=1 year.

So:

(M_total1/M_total2) = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1 )

Calculate 15^3 = 3375, 25^3=15625.

So:

= (3375 * 2) / (15625 *1 )

= 6750 / 15625 = ?

Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750 ÷25 = 270, 15625 ÷25=625.

So 270 ÷ 625 = 0.432.

So M_total1 is 0.432 times M_total2. So system 1's mass is about 0.43 times that of system 2. So system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Wait, but 0.432 is less than 1, so system_1 is less massive than system_2.

Wait, the options are about how much more massive system_1 is than system_2. But from the calculation, system_1 is less massive. So the factor would be less than 1. So the options are A) ~0.4, which would mean system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_2 is more massive.

Wait, but the question says, "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if the ratio is 0.432, that would mean system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive, so the factor is less than 1. So the correct answer would be option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation:

15^3 is 15*15=225, 225*15=3375.

25^3 is 25*25=625, 625*25=15625.

So 3375 *2 = 6750.

15625 *1=15625.

6750 / 15625 = 0.432.

So the ratio is approximately 0.432, which is about 0.43. Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B is ~0.6. So the closest is option A.

So the factor is approximately 0.4, meaning system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.4. So the answer is A) ~0.4.


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and total mass in binary systems. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} \propto \frac{(v_1 + v_2)^3 \cdot P}{1}
\]

where \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, and \(P\) is the orbital period of the system. The factor of proportionality is constant for both systems, so we can directly compute the ratio of the total masses of the two systems:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(v_{1,1} + v_{2,1})^3 \cdot P_1}{(v_{1,2} + v_{2,2})^3 \cdot P_2}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the total velocities
For system_1:
\[
v_{\text{sum,1}} = v_{1,1} + v_{2,1} = 10 + 5 = 15 \, \text{km/s}
\]

For system_2:
\[
v_{\text{sum,2}} = v_{1,2} + v_{2,2} = 15 + 10 = 25 \, \text{km/s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio of total masses
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1}
\]

First, calculate the cubes:
\[
15^3 = 3375, \quad 25^3 = 15625
\]

Now substitute:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625 \cdot 1} = \frac{6750}{15625}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The ratio \(M_{\text{total,1}} / M_{\text{total,2}} \approx 0.432\), meaning system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2. This corresponds to option **A**.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately **0.4**.

**Answer: A**
