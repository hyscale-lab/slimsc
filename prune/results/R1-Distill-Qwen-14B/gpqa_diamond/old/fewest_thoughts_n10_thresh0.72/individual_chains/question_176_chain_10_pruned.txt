Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's an interesting vector. I think in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually supposed to be normalized, meaning their length (or magnitude) is 1. So let me check if this vector is normalized.

Calculating the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, right, so the norm is sqrt(6), which means the vector is not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first. But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization. Let me think. Oh, wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors must be normalized to 1. So maybe I need to divide each component by sqrt(6) to get the actual state vector. Because the given state is (-1, 2, 1), so the normalized state would be (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))^T. But the question is about measuring P and then Q. So I need to calculate the probabilities of getting certain outcomes when measuring P and then Q.

The operators for P and Q are given as square matrices. Let's look at them. 

Operator P's matrix is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And operator Q's matrix is diagonal: 
First row: 1,0,0
Second row:0,0,0
Third row:0,0,-1

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. Because diagonal matrices have their diagonal elements as eigenvalues, right? So when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, or -1.

Wait, but the measurement of Q is just after the measurement of P, so the system's state would have collapsed into an eigenstate of P after the first measurement. I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, then -1 when measuring Q.

Hmm. So the process is: first measure P, get outcome 0, which would cause the state to collapse to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measure Q on this new state to get outcome -1. The probability is the product of the two probabilities, assuming the measurements are independent (which they are in this setup).

Wait, no, not exactly. The process is: first, the initial state is |ψ⟩ = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6). Because that's the normalized vector. Then, when you measure P, you can get some eigenvalue, and the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector. So the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Wait, but operator P is given, and I need to find its
