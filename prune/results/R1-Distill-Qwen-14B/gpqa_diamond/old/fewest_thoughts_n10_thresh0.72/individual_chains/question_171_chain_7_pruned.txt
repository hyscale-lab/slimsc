Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about six substituted benzene rings reacting with excess bromine. Each will form a monobromo derivative, and I need to arrange them based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Wait, wait. So the idea is that some substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to certain positions on the ring, right?

Electrophilic substitution on benzene derivatives depends on the substituents' directing effects. Substituents can be activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directors.

First, I should list each substituent and determine their directing effects.

1) ะก6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Activating groups make the ring more reactive towards electrophiles. Also, since it's an activating group, it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions relative to itself. So in this case, when Br adds, more para product is formed.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a ethyl ester group, specifically the carbonyl group. Wait, the substituent here is a COOEt group. The carbonyl is a strong deactivating group because it's electron-withdrawing. But is it meta or para directing? I think carbonyl groups like ketones or esters are meta directors because they withdraw electrons through resonance. So if the substituent is a COOR group, the incoming Br would go to the meta position. So for this substituent, the major product would be meta, not para. So the para fraction would be low.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine substituent. Chlorine is an interesting case. It's a deactivating group because of the electronegativity, but it's also ortho/para directing. Wait, because Cl has lone pairs, it can donate electrons through resonance, but the inductive effect is stronger (electron-withdrawing). So Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. So the incoming Br would go into ortho and para positions. So a significant amount of para product.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the substituent directs the electrophile to the meta position. So the nitro group would lead to meta substitution, meaning para product is minimal.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethyl group, similar to methyl. It's an activating, ortho/para director. So the para isomer would form, but because it's a bulky group, maybe the para is more favorable? Or perhaps the substituent's size affects the position. Wait, but in general, the ethyl group is ortho/para, but steric hindrance can influence the product. For example, in toluene derivatives, the para position is more favored because it's less crowded. So for ethyl, maybe the para is the major product.

6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group. Like the ester, but even more deactivating. The COOH group is a strong deactivating (electron-withdrawing), meta-directing group. So when Br substitutes, it goes meta. So para product is low.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify each substituent's effect:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para. So para product is major.

2) COOEt: deactivating, meta. So para is minor.

3) Cl: deactivating (but activating compared to deactivating groups?), but wait, Cl is ortho/para. So para product would be a major product? Because Cl is a stronger deactivating group than NO2? No, wait. The nitro group is more deactivating
