Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in a system. The system's state is given, and we need to find the probability of getting specific outcomes after measuring P and then Q.

First, let me parse the given information. The system's state at time t is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait—usually quantum states are represented as unit vectors, meaning their length (norm) is 1. Let me check the norm here. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the square of the magnitude is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh wait, that's 6. So the state isn't normalized. Hmm, but maybe it doesn't matter because in quantum mechanics, the state can be any vector, and probabilities are calculated using the normalized state. Or perhaps they just gave the state as is, and I should normalize it before proceeding.

Wait, the problem says the state is a column matrix. So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ] / sqrt(6), because sqrt(6) is the norm. Because probabilities are based on the squared magnitudes of the components. So I should represent the state as a normalized vector. So I'll write |ψ> as [ -1/sqrt(
