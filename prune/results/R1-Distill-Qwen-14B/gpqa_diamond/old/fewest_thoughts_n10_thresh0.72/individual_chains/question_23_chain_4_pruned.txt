Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot was diminished, and two new spots appeared. The options are possible products, and I need to pick which one is correct.

Hmm. So first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking that down: but-3-en-1-yl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 3, so it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O- attached to benzene? No, wait, that's if the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, the numbering is a bit tricky. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl.

Butane has four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but that can't be because in butene, the double bond is between 1 and 2 (1-butene) or 2 and 3 (cis or trans-2-butene). Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Because the substituents are counted from the point of attachment. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene.

So the butenyl group is attached via the 1-position (the first carbon) to the oxygen. So the structure goes: benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- with the substituents. Wait, no. Let me try to draw it.

The substituents are on the 2nd carbon of the butenyl group. So the structure
