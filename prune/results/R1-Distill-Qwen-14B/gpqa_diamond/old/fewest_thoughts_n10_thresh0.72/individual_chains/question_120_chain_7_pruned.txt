Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance. So if a star has a parallax of p, its distance d is 1/p parsecs. Oh right, the formula is d = 1 / p. 

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? I think it probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume. But wait, how does parallax come into play here?

Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Since parallax p is inversely proportional to distance, as the parallax decreases, the distance increases. So stars with smaller parallaxes are farther away.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I'm looking at a range of parallax, say from p to p + dp, how many stars are there in that range? 

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d+dd would be proportional to the surface area of the shell multiplied by the thickness dd and the number density. 

Wait, surface area of a sphere is 4πr², right? So the number of stars in a thin shell around radius r is n * 4πr² dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) is n * 4πr².

But since we're dealing with parallax, let's express this in terms of p. Since d = 1/p, then r = d = 1/p. So r = 1/p. Let's substitute that into the equation.

The number of stars per unit distance dr is n * 4π (1/p)² dr. But wait, dr is in terms of distance, and we want to express this in terms of parallax p. Let me see: since p = 1/d, then dp/d = -1/d². So dr = - dp / p². Oh right, because differentiating p=1/d gives dp = - (1
