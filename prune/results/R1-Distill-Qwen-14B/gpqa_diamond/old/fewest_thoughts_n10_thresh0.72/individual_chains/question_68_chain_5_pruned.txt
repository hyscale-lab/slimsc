Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, it's about spin 1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Alright, I remember that spin is an intrinsic form of angular momentum in quantum mechanics.

The problem says the particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the z-component of the spin operator. So mu = gamma * Sz. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, right? That connects the magnetic moment to the spin.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's moment is aligned with B. Then the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the field changes direction from z to y.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Oh, so after the field changes, the expectation value of S_z starts oscillating, and we need to find the frequency of that oscillation.

I think this has to do with the time evolution of the spin state when the magnetic field changes. Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. Since mu is proportional to spin, H is proportional to S · B.

Initially, the field is along +Z, so H_initial = -gamma * Sz * B. The eigenstates of Sz are |+z> and |-z>, so the system was in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. When the field is turned off, wait, but then the field is turned on along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma * S_y * B. Because the field is along Y now.

Wait, but when the field is suddenly changed, the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously. So the state right after the change is the same as before, which was an eigenstate of Sz. But the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so the state is not an eigenstate anymore. So the system will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

What's the expectation value of S_z after the field change? Let's model this. Let's denote the initial state as |psi(0)>. Since the initial field was along +Z, the particle's magnetic moment was aligned, so the state was probably in |+z>, the eigenstate with Sz = ħ/2. But wait, spin-1/2 systems have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So, for a spin-1/2 particle, Sz can be ħ/2 or -ħ/2.

Wait, but mu is given as gamma * Sz. So if the initial state is |+z>, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma*(ħ/2). So the initial state is |+z>.

Now, after the field is turned to +Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Let me compute this. S_y is the spin operator in y-direction. The important thing is that the state |+z> is not an eigenstate of S_y. Therefore, it will evolve in time.

The time evolution is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state
