Okay, so I need to design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, let me think. Retroviruses are RNA viruses, right? So their genetic material is RNA. When they infect a host, like humans, they use reverse transcriptase to make a DNA copy from their RNA. That DNA then integrates into the host's genome.

So, the question is about how to design a quick diagnostic kit. The options are about different methods like PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA, etc.

Option A says to identify the virus using symptoms and then design nested PCR. Wait, symptoms aren't enough. Different diseases can have similar symptoms. So identification based solely on symptoms might not be reliable. Plus, designing a PCR needs specific genetic info.

Option B suggests using cDNA sequencing. Oh, right, because the virus is RNA-based, so their genome is RNA. To sequence it, you might first make cDNA using reverse transcriptase. So identifying the virus through cDNA sequencing makes sense. Then real-time PCR would be used for quick diagnosis. Real-time PCR is good for quantifying and detecting specific sequences quickly, so that sounds efficient.

Option C talks about DNA sequencing. Wait, if it's a retrovirus, the DNA sequencing would be of what? The host's DNA? Or perhaps the virus's genome after integration. But for initial identification, maybe the viral RNA is sequenced, so DNA sequencing might not be the first step. Unless they're talking about the host's response, but I think cDNA (from the virus) is more direct.

Option D is about IgG antibodies. ELISA tests for antibodies would indicate past infection, not current. Since it's an outbreak, they probably need to detect the virus quickly, not just past exposure. So maybe not the best option for an acute diagnosis.

So the process is: first, identify the virus. Since it's a retrovirus, its RNA is the primary genome. To identify its genetic info, you need to make cDNA from the viral RNA and then sequence it. Once you have the genetic sequence, you can design primers for PCR.

Real-time PCR (option B) is a good choice because it's fast, can quantify, and is very accurate. Nested PCR (option A) can be more sensitive but might take longer or require more steps, so real-time is probably better for a quick test.

So the correct approach is option B: cDNA sequencing for identification, then real-time PCR for the kit.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is important to consider the nature of retroviruses, which are RNA viruses. Their genetic material is RNA, and they use reverse transcriptase to produce cDNA during infection. For quick and accurate diagnosis, the first step is to identify the virus by sequencing its genetic material. This is best achieved through cDNA sequencing, as it directly targets the viral RNA and provides the necessary genetic information.

Once the virus is identified, real-time PCR is an ideal choice for the diagnostic kit. Real-time PCR is fast, highly sensitive, and allows for accurate detection and quantification of specific genetic sequences. Nested PCR (option A) could also work but is generally less efficient and more labor-intensive compared to real-time PCR. DNA sequencing (option C) is not the first step for identifying a retrovirus, as the virus's primary genome is RNA. Similarly, an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies (option D) is less suitable for acute diagnosis, as it detects past infections rather than current viral presence.

Thus, the best approach is to first identify the virus using cDNA sequencing and then develop a real-time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.

Answer: B
