Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about two planets orbiting a star, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

First, let me read the question carefully again. So, both planets are detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with radius 1.3. Both orbits are circular.

The next part is about the Doppler shifts. Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. But wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's motion caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift here is given in terms of the forbidden line, but I think what's important is the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, but the question is about equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I remember is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

Te = T_star * ( ( R_star / (2 * a) ) )^(1/2)

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another version I've heard is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), yes. So, the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the star's radius and the inverse square root of the planet's orbital distance.

But wait, how do I find the orbital distances? Because the question doesn't give the orbital periods or distances directly. Hmm.

Wait, but the RV method gives us the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star's orbit. The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. But I don
