Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, right? So when the star moves towards us, the spectral lines shift blue, and when it moves away, they shift red. The periodic shifts indicate the planet's presence.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, same star mass, same planet mass, but different Doppler shifts observed.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, why would the shift be different? Oh, right, the Doppler shift depends on the star's velocity towards or away from us. So a larger shift would mean the star is moving more quickly.

But wait, the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is related to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c, where c is the speed of light. So delta lambda is the shift (like 5 or 7 milliangstroms), and lambda is the original wavelength of the spectral line.

But in this case, the same spectral line is used for both stars, so lambda is the same for both measurements. Therefore, the ratio of their velocities is the same as the ratio of their shifts. So the velocity of star 1 (v1) is 5 milliangstroms, and v2 is 7. So v2 is larger than v1 by a factor of 7/5, which is 1.4. But wait, does this directly relate to the orbital period?

Wait, no. Because the velocity of the star is related to the planet's orbital period. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. Since the stars have the same mass, and the planets have the same mass, but wait, no, wait: the question says the stars have the same mass as our Sun, and the planets have masses similar to Neptune. So planet mass is same for both, star mass same for both. So the planet and star masses are the same for each system.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K (which is the star's velocity) is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* +
