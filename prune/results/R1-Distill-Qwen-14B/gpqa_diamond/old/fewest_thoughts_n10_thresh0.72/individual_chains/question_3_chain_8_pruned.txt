Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state, which is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of sigma-z (σz), right? And the question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

Hmm. So, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So for the operator 10σz +5σx, the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Right, because expectation values are linear, so I can split it into the two parts.

First, let's find the expectation value of σz. Since the state is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write that as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1).

Calculating |a|^2: (0.5)^2 =0.25.
Calculating |b|^2: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4)=0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Next, I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix, and its eigenstates are the |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ states, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way to approach this.

Wait, the expectation value of σx is given by ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me compute that.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so in terms of basis vectors, σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So, σx acting on ψ would be σx (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩) = a σx |↑⟩ + b σx |↓⟩ = a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩.

So, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is (a* ⟨↑| + b* ⟨↓|) (a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩ )

Wait, expanding this out:

= a a* (⟨↑|↓⟩) + a b* (⟨↑|↑⟩) + b a* (⟨↓|↓⟩) + b b* (⟨↓|↑⟩ )

But ⟨↑|↓⟩ is 0, and ⟨↑|↑⟩ is 1, same for ⟨↓|↓⟩ is 1, and ⟨↓|↑⟩ is 0.

So it simplifies to a a* *0 + a b* *1 + b a* *1 + b b* *0.

Which is a b* + b a*.

Wait, because a is 0.5, real number, and b is sqrt(3)/2, also real. So a* is a, and b* is b.

So this becomes a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought σx has eigenvalues, and the expectation value is |a|^2 + |b|^2 but adjusted for the cross terms. Hmm, maybe I should double-check this approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can write σx in terms of its matrix and compute ψ† σx ψ.

So, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The state ψ is a column vector [a; b], where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So, ψ† is [a*, b*], which in this case is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], since a and b are real.

So ψ† σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute σx ψ: [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, ψ† multiplied by that: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

The dot product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Each term is (sqrt(3)/4), so adding them gives 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So, that's correct. ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*0.866 ≈4.33.

Now, the total expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩ = (-5) + 4.33 ≈-0.67.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see -0.67... The options are A)-1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.
