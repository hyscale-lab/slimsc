Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a given compound. Let me read through the problem again and figure out what I need to do.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, I need to figure out which NMR option matches this structure.

First, let's break down the information. The compound has a benzene ring (since it's aromatic and 6-membered), and it's di-substituted, meaning two substituents are attached. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 carbons in total.

Wait, but each substituent can have multiple carbons. Wait, no, because di-substituted means two substituents, each could be a single group. Let me think. So, if the benzene has two substituents, each substituent can be a group that adds certain carbons. For the total to be 8 (6 from benzene plus 2 from substituents), each substituent must add one carbon each, right? Because 6 + 2 = 8.

But wait, maybe not. Let me clarify. Wait, the substituents themselves could have more carbons. For example, if one substituent is a -CO- group, but that's a carbonyl, which doesn't add more carbons because it's a substituent like a ketone. Wait, no, the substituent is attached to the ring. For example, if it's an acyl group, like an acetophenone group, which is a benzene ring with a ketone substituent. But that would add two carbons (like R-CO- attached). Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (so there's a C=O somewhere) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the substituents must include both a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen atom attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, wait. No, the aromatic-halogen bond is a substituent on the ring. So, the substituents are: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, acyl, etc.), and the other could be a halogen
