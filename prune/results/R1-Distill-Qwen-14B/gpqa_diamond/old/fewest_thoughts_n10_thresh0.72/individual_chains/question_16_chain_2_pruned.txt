Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when there's no plane of symmetry and it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So, I need to go through each of the compounds and determine if they're chiral.

Let's take them one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait no, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. Then 2-methyl: so the second carbon has a CH(CH3). Wait, let me think. Structure: CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, which is four carbons, double bond starting at first carbon.

So it's CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, 1-chloro would be on the first carbon. Wait, but double bonds are between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but
