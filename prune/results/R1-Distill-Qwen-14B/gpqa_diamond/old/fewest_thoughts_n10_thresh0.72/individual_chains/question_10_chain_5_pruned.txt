Alright, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out which of the given options has the highest density. The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a different scenario.

Okay, first, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So density = mass/volume. But wait, how does the mass and radius (which relates to volume) affect the density here?

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, which I think is the average. So this planet would have the same density as Earth. But wait, let me think again. Since it's Earth mass and radius, yeah, same density. So maybe option a is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Hmm, wait, the problem says the density is already given as 5.5, so I don't need to calculate it. But wait, is that possible? Because if a planet is more massive than Earth but same density, it should have a larger volume, right? Because density is mass over volume. So if mass is double and density same, volume would be double as well. But volume scales with the cube of radius, so the radius would be larger. But the question says the density is 5.5, so I think I can take that as given. So option b's density is 5.5.

Option c:
