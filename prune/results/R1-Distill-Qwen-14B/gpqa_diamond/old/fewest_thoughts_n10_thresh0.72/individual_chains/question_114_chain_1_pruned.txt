Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, right? And I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: Select the suitable reagents for the following reactions.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagents A and B.

Hmm. Let me break this down. I think the first reaction is an addition reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone. When ketones react with cyanide ions, I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, but what's the mechanism here. Oh right, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. The cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, and then maybe something else happens. So in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, what's the product? 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So it's a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Wait, but how does that happen? So the starting material is (CH3)2CO. When it adds CN- as a nucleophile, it would form (CH3)2C(O-) CN. But then, what about the next step? Because in the product, there's an OH group.

I think this is a hydrolysis step. So maybe the cyanide adds to the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. But wait, under what conditions does that happen? Oh, right, the formation of cyanohydrins typically involves adding HCN, but in this case, it's NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. But I think you also need an acid catalyst for the addition.

Wait, so in the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid. Because I remember that in the formation of cyanohy
