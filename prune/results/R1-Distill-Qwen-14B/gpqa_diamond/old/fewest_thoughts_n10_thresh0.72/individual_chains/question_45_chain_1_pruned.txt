Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, okay, let's think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the problem gives E as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), which is the base unit. So E is basically E_1 for a single particle in the ground state.

Wait, so E_n = n² E, because E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E, E_3=9E, and so on. So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n squared times E.

Now, the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles. Spin-1/2 means they're fermions, right? So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But wait, since it's a 1D well, what defines the quantum state? The quantum number n and the spin. Oh wait, spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states: up and down. So for each n, you can have two particles with different spins.

So the problem is about four particles. Let's think about how they would fill up the energy levels. Each state can hold two particles: one spin up, one spin down.

Ground state: We want the lowest energy possible. So the particles will fill the lowest energy states first.

So for four particles:

- The first two particles will go into the n=1 state, each with opposite spins. So that's 2 particles with n=1. So their total energy is 2 * E_1 = 2E.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait a second. Each particle in the same n level contributes E_n once. Wait, no, if two particles are in the same n but different spins, that's allowed. So for the ground state, all four particles can't be in n=1 because each n can have two particles. So n=1 can hold 2, n=2 can hold 2, right?

Wait, four particles. So n=1 can take two (spin up and down), n=2 can take two, so that's all four. So in the ground state, two particles are in n=1, two in n=2.

So the total energy is 2*E_1 + 2*E_2. E_1 is E, E_2 is (

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics. But I'll give it a shot. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says we have four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. We need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The options are given, and each option lists three energies. The answer E is given as (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), which I think is the formula for the energy levels of a single particle in a 1D box. Right, because for a particle in a box, the energy levels are quantized and given by E_n = (n²) * something, where n is an integer.

Since the particles are spin-1/2, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. Oh wait, but wait, in a 1D box, the quantum number is just the principal quantum number n, right? Because in 1D, there's only one degree of freedom for the spatial part.

So each particle has a spin quantum number s = 1/2, and the possible magnetic spin quantum numbers are +1/2 and -1/2. So each spatial state can hold up to two particles with opposite spins.

So the idea is to fill up the available quantum states in order of increasing energy, considering the Pauli exclusion.

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of each individual particle. So for each particle, we'll assign the lowest possible n values that haven't been taken yet, considering their spin.

Let me think about the order. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration, so all particles will be in the lowest possible states. The first excited state is the next lowest energy, and so on.

Wait, but since the particles are identical fermions (they're spin-1/2), their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. That includes both the spatial part and the spin part. So for the same spatial state, the spin part must be antisymmetric, which for two particles is a singlet state (spin up and down). But when filling the orbitals, each spatial orbital can hold two particles with opposite spins.

But when the spatial part is the same, the spin part must be antisymmetric. So each spatial state can have a maximum of two particles: one spin up and one spin down.

So let's model this: each spatial level (n=1, n=2, etc.) can hold up to two particles because of spin.

Now, four particles: so let's see how they fill the energy levels.

Each particle's energy is E_n = (n²) * E, where E is given as (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²). So E_1 = 1E, E_2 = 4E, E_3=9E, E_4=16E, etc.

Wait, no, wait: the given E is already (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²). So the formula for each particle's energy is E_n = (n²
