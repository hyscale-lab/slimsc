Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I remember that the question is about a genetic construct and why a certain fluorescent signal isn't showing up in the mice. 

Alright, the setup: We're dealing with a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding. The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. 

The vector details: It's bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs in one transcript. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. 

Wait, what's an IRES? I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so they can drive translation of the downstream ORF without it being dependent on the termination of the upstream one. So in this case, the CBA promoter would drive the translation of the ligand, and the IRES would allow for the receptor's translation as well. 

Now, the stop cassettes: Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. LoxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. So, when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette before eGFP. I think lox2272 is a variant that only Cre can recognize if it's in the same orientation as loxP? Or maybe it's a different system. Wait, maybe this is about different Cre strains or something. Oh wait, lox2272 is a 'floxed' site that can only be cut by Cre if it's in a certain configuration. But I'm not too clear on that. Maybe I'll come back to that point.

The antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, and they were used in a Western blot. They tested the construct expression. So the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin loading, meaning the proteins are being expressed because they're detected. So the problem isn't that the proteins aren't being made.

Then, they breed a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they cross these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. Cre would be expressed under the SOX10 promoter, so in neural crest cells, I think. When they do that, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, so the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would be expressed. 

But when they look under the confocal, they don't see the green signal (which I suppose is eGFP). So why isn't eGFP showing up?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if they're expressed in the same cells, they might not be in a paracrine relationship. Hmm, but this option is about their interaction, not their expression in the mice. I'm not sure if this explains the lack of GFP.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, it wouldn't be expressed on the cell surface, so you wouldn't see the green fluorescence. But how would that happen because of the construct? The stop cassette was between the receptor and eGFP, so if Cre is working, the stop is removed, and the receptor and eGFP should be expressed. But if there's an issue with the expression, perhaps the eGFP isn't being made. Or maybe the receptor is glycosylated and can't get out? I'm not sure. Maybe the expression is faulty.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But I thought the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. And the receptor is under IRES, which is after the CBA-driven ligand. So the enhancer wouldn't be the issue here. Unless the expression requires certain enhancers that are missing, but the question doesn't mention any, so this might not be the case.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh wait, the ORFs. If the stop cassette after the receptor ORF is lox227
