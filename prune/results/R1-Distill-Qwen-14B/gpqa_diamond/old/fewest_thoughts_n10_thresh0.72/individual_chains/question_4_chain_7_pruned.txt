Okay, so I've got this Maxwell's equations question here, and I need to figure out which equations would change if magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always come in pairs—like a north and south pole. So you can't have a magnet with just one pole. I think that relates to one of Maxwell's equations.

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me recall them. The first one is about the divergence of the electric field. It says that the divergence of E is proportional to the charge density. The second is Faraday's law, which deals with the curl of the electric field and changing magnetic fields. The third is Gauss's law for magnetism, which says the divergence of B is zero. The fourth is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, about the curl of B and the current plus displacement current.

So the question is about a universe where you can have isolated North or South poles. That would mean that the divergence of B isn't zero anymore, right? Because if you have a monopole, say a single north pole, then the divergence of B at that point would not be zero. Because in our universe, the divergence of B is zero, so there are no magnetic monopoles. So if monopoles existed, that equation would change.

Wait, which equation is that? Oh right, the third equation: ∇·B = 0. So that equation would definitely change. But the question is asking which of Maxwell's equations are different in this universe. So option A says the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. That would be equation three. So in this scenario, equation three would change because you can have monopoles.

Wait, but the options don't all refer to just one equation. Let me check what each option says.

Option A says the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equation three, which would be different.

Option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of B. The circulation of E is Faraday's Law, which is equation two. So would that change? Hmm, Faraday's law relates the curl of E to the negative rate of change of B. If you have monopoles, does that affect Faraday's Law? I don't think so, because Faraday's Law is about changing magnetic fields and induced electric
