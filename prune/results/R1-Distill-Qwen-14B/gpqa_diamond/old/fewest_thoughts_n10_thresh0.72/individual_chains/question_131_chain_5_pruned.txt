Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Hmm, dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid usually leads to the formation of an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its 1H NMR. Wait, 7 ppm is usually where aromatic protons are. But wait, could it be something else? Or maybe it's an AB system that's collapsed into a singlet due to symmetry?

Then the 13C NMR has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about what those carbons could be. 137 ppm is probably a carbon attached to an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl group. Wait no, 165 is likely a carbonyl. For 13C NMR, carbonyl carbons (like in anhydrides) are around 170-220 ppm. So 165 is close. The 137 might be a carbon attached to an oxygen, maybe an ester or anhydride oxygen. Or perhaps a double bond, like in an alkene. Wait, in alkenes, carbons are around 100-150. 137 is in that range.

So the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR. Maybe it's symmetric. For example, if the structure is such that all the equivalent protons are in one environment. So perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure with symmetry.

Next, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product's molecular formula is C13H16O3. The starting anhydride would have a certain number of carbons, and the cyclopentadiene adds the rest.

Wait, the starting dicarboxylic acid was dehydrated to an anhydride. So the anhydride would have two less oxygen atoms. Let me think about the structures
