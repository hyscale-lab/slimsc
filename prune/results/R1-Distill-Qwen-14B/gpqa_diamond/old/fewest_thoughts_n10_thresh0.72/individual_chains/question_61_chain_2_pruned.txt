Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene, and after several steps, we get a final product. The options are four different biphenyl structures with various substituents. I think I need to track each reaction to see how the substituents change.

Let me start by breaking down each step.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that HNO3 is a nitrating agent, typically in sulfuric acid as a catalyst. Benzene nitrating would form nitrobenzene, but wait—no, wait, wait. Wait, when benzene is nitrated with concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3, it undergoes electrophilic substitution. The nitronium ion is the electrophile. So product 1 should be nitrobenzene. So nitro group is attached at the para position? Or maybe it's meta? No, wait, benzene is symmetric, so nitration gives a single product. Nitrobenzene has the nitro group in the para position, but wait, no, wait. Wait, when you nitrate benzene, the nitro group can go into any position, but it's more activated in the positions that are more reactive. Wait, no—nitration is a meta director, but wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so
