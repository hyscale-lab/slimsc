Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz. Sz is the spin in the z-direction, right? Spin-1/2 particles have Sz eigenvalues of ± ħ/2. But wait, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. So mu is proportional to spin.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the particle's spin is aligned with that field. That would mean its magnetic moment is either +mu or -mu, depending on the state. But then the field is switched off, and another along +Y is turned on. So now the magnetic field is in the y-direction.

I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field direction. But how does that affect the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment?

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component. So maybe we need to look at how the expectation value
