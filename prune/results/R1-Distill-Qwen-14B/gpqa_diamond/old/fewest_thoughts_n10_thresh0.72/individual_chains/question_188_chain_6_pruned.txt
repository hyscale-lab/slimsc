Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me try to think this through.

Rhombohedral crystals... I remember they have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been deformed. The lattice parameters are usually a, b, c, but in a rhombohedral case, a = b = c, and the angles α, β, γ are all the same. Oh wait, in this case, α, β, γ are each 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms.

Wait, wait. Interatomic distance in a crystal... that's the distance between neighboring atoms along the edges of the unit cell. So in a simple cubic structure, that would just be the lattice parameter a, right? But in a rhombohedral structure, if the atoms are at the corners, then the edge length 'a' would be the interatomic distance. So in this problem, a = 10 Angstroms.

But wait, the question is about interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the Bragg's law formula, which is d = (a^2 (sin α)^2 (sin β)^2 (sin γ)^2 )^(1/4) divided by something... Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

The general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is more complicated. For a cubic system, it's simpler because a = b = c and the angles are 90 degrees, so the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But in this case, it's a rhombohedral system, so I can't use that.

Wait, the Miller indices here are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

I remember there's a general formula for the interplanar distance in
