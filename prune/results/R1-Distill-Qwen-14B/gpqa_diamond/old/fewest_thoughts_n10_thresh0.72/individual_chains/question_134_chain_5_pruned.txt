Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem says that 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given, but I'm not sure which one is correct yet.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. And for strong acids and bases, the enthalpy is approximately constant, around -57 kJ per mole or something like that. But I also think that the value can vary a bit depending on the specific acid and base.

Hmm, but wait, how do I approach this problem? Maybe I should first figure out the moles of each acid and base involved. Because the reaction will depend on how much acid and base are present.

Let me list the substances:

- HCl: strong acid, 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one H+.

- H2SO4: sulfuric acid, strong acid, but it's diprotic. So each mole can donate 2 H+ ions. The concentration is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL (0.3 L). Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, no, wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, it's a strong acid and completely dissociates. So the first H+ is fully released, but the second H+ isn't as strong. Wait, no, I think for the purpose of neutralization calculations, especially in dilute solutions, H2SO4 is considered to donate two H+ per molecule. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think. In strong acids, both H+ are released. Like H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So, yes, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles of H+.

Now Ba(OH)2: it's a strong base. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.

The concentration is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL (0.2 L). Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, wait, let me sum up:

H+ from HCl: 0
