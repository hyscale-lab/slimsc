Okay, so I've got this physics problem about uncertainty in quantum mechanics. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right, that's the standard formula from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

First, I need to find the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. The system is in a specific state, which is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So this is the state vector ψ.

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the matrix for P_z is diagonal, I think. Looking at the matrix given for P_z: it's diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The basis states are probably |+⟩, |0⟩, |-⟩ corresponding to these eigenvalues.

The state ψ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Let me write ψ as a combination:

ψ = a|+⟩ + b|0⟩ + c|−⟩.

Looking at the components, the first component is a, the second is b, and the third is c. But wait, in the matrix representation, the basis vectors are usually taken as column vectors. So the state vector given is:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

But wait, let me make sure. The components of the state are (a, b, c), right? So yes, that's correct.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. The operator P_z is a diagonal matrix with elements [ħ, 0, -ħ]. So when ψ is in this state, the expectation value is:

⟨P_z⟩ = a* (ħ a) + b* (0) + c* (-ħ c), because each basis state |+
