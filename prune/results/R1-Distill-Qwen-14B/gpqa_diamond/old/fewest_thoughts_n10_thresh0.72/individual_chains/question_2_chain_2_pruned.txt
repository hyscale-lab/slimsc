Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. Then, each product undergoes a treatment, and I need to find out how many carbon atoms are in the final product, product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

Hmm, I remember that trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a double bond. Let me visualize its structure. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is CH₂=CH-CHO, but wait, no, wait. No, wait: cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. Oh right, it's (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. So it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, not that. Oh wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde derived from cinnamic acid. So the structure is:

The aldehyde group is at the end of a propenyl chain attached to a benzene ring. So it's:

Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, wait, cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me draw it. The correct structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no. Wait, prop-2-enal is CH₂=CH-CHO. But with cinnamaldehyde, the aldehyde is attached to a double bond which is attached to a benzene ring. So it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that's not right. Let me think again. Oh wait, cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is: the benzene ring is attached to a
