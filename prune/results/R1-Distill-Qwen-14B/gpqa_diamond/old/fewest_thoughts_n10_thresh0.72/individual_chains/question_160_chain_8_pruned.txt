Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark spots called maxima and minima. The problem is asking about the angular distance between the first two minima when the number of sides N is infinitely large. 

Wait, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is essentially a smooth circle. So in that case, the aperture is a circular one. But wait, the problem says the apothems are all the same length 'a'. Oh, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. So for a regular polygon, all apothems are equal, which makes sense. So for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is the same for each side. 

But since N is going to infinity, the polygon is a circle. So the setup is a circular aperture with radius equal to the apothem. Wait, no. Wait, for a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the radius (the distance from the center to a vertex). Let me think. The apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle of the polygon. So when N is large, the polygon approximates a circle, and the apothem is the radius of that circle. So the radius of the circular aperture is 'a'. 

So the problem is about a circular aperture with radius '
