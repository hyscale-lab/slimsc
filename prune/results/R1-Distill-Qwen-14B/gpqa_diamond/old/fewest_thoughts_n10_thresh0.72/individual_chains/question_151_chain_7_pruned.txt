Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step. 

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be a unit vector, right? Because the probabilities have to add up to 1. Let me check the magnitude of this vector. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the magnitude squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized yet. But wait, for probability calculations, I think I need the state to be normalized. So probably I should divide each component by sqrt(6) to get the actual state vector. Let me note that down.

So, the state vector |ψ> is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. Because when you square each component and add them, you get (1/6 +4/6 +1/6)=6/6=1. Yep, that makes sense.

Next, the observable is given by matrix P. Let me write down P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So, P looks like this:

| 0       1/√2     0   |
|1/√2    0        1/√2|
| 0       1/√2    0   |

Wait, I'm wondering if this is a Hermitian matrix because observables must be represented by Hermitian operators. Let me check. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements here are real, it's the same as the transpose. So, let's transpose P and see if it's the same. The first row of P is [0, 1/√2, 0], the second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], third [0, 1/√2, 0]. The transpose would have the first column as 0, 1/√2, 0; second column 1/√2, 0, 1/√2; third column 0, 1/√2, 0. Which is the same as the original P. So P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. Good, that checks out.

Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring 0 when we measure the observable P. I remember that in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, you get one of its eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

So, I need to find the eigenvalues of P because the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. Then
