Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetic constructs. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The question describes a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The goal is to understand their developmental fate. So, the setup is about how the construct was made and why the expected result isn't showing up.

The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes, in this case, the ligand and the receptor. The ligand is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. 

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh wait, I remember that loxP sites are used in recombination. Cre recombinase recognizes them. The stop cassette probably blocks expression unless Cre is present to excise it.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and checked with Western blot using antibodies against the proteins. The blot shows signal proportional to actin, which just confirms the loading. But when they breed mice homozygous for the construct and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring don't show green fluorescence under the confocal. So the eGFP isn't lighting up.

Wait, why isn't eGFP expressed? Let's think about how the construct works. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is probably a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES, so I think that means it's a separate ORF. But the stop cassettes must be involved in turning them on or off.

In the construct, the ligand is first, then mCherry with a loxP stop. The receptor is after an IRES, then eGFP with lox2272 stop. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed because the stop is before mCherry, but perhaps the receptor is also expressed because IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so maybe the receptor is expressed without the ligand?

Wait, no. IRES elements are used in bicistronic vectors to allow the second gene to be expressed. So the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which would be dependent on the first gene's promoter. So both would be expressed in the same cell.

But in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes would be removed. Wait, but in the vector, the ligand's mCherry is after the stop cassette. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but the mCherry might be blocked since the stop is there. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop cassette, so without Cre, only receptor might be expressed, and eGFP would be blocked.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The ligand ORF is at 5', followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is at 3', preceded by IRES, followed by a stop cassette (lox2272) and eGFP.

So in the vector, the ligand's expression would be: CBA promoter drives the ligand ORF, then after that, the stop cassette with loxP sites. So the ligand would be expressed, but the mCherry is after the stop, so without Cre, the mCherry wouldn't be expressed because the stop cassette is in between.

Similarly, for the receptor, the IRES is upstream, so in the absence of Cre, the stop after the receptor would prevent eGFP expression. So when the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would recombine the lox sites. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, which is where these genes are initially expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse model, the construct is homozygous. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes. So for the ligand, the loxP sites would be cut, removing the stop cassette, allowing mCherry to be expressed. For the receptor, the lox2272 sites would be cut, removing the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in the experiment, the green signal (from eGFP) isn't observed. So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Let's consider the options:

Option A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. That means they act on different cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells. If they're paracrine, the ligand would be secreted, but that doesn't explain why the construct isn't working. So probably not the reason for no GFP.

Option B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't properly trafficked, maybe no signal. But why would that happen? If the construct is correctly made, the eGFP should be correctly folded and traffic. Unless there's a problem with the signal peptide or something. But the question doesn't mention anything about the targeting sequences, so maybe this isn't the case.

Option C) Enhancer for expression is missing. Both the ligand and receptor are under certain promoters. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps the expression isn't happening. But the vector seems to have the promoters, so I'm not sure. Or maybe the CBA promoter isn't active in the cells they're looking at.

Option D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not correctly spliced, the eGFP might not be expressed because the stop codon is encountered early. But the stop is in the cassette. Wait, in the construct, the receptor is followed by a stop cassette, so without Cre, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But when Cre is present, the stop is removed, so the receptor and eGFP should be expressed. So if the eGFP is not in frame after the receptor, perhaps the fusion protein isn't made. But the question says the eGFP is at the C-terminus, so perhaps the ORF is in frame.
