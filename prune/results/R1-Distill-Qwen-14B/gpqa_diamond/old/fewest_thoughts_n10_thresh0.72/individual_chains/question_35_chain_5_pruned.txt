Okay, let's see. I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm. So the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me try to break it down.

First, the operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, right? And c is h/(4π). Oh, wait, no, the problem says Ay = c·S, and c is h/(4π). So c is a constant, and S is a 2x2 matrix. Oh, and S's first row is 0 and -i, and the second row is i and 0. So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait, but then Ay would be c times this matrix. So substituting c, Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. So the matrix for Ay is:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. To do that, I can solve the eigenvalue equation Ay φ = a φ.

Wait, but since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me write out the matrix Ay. So each element would be:

Top left: 0 * c = 0
Top right: (-i) * c = -i h/(4π)
Bottom left: i * c = i h/(4π)
Bottom right: 0 * c = 0

So Ay looks like:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0, A ],
[ -A*, 0 ]

Wait, where A = (i h)/(4π). Wait, no, let me compute A properly. Let me compute c * each element. So for S, the (1,2) element is -i, so multiplied by c, it's (-i)(h/(4π)). So the top right is (-i h)/(4π). Similarly, the bottom left is i*(h/(4π)).

So the matrix is:

0      (-i h)/(4π)
(i h)/(4π)   0

Hmm. Now, the eigenvalues are
