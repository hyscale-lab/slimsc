Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity yet, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames, so no acceleration involved. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, wait, so in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards them. So from the galaxy's perspective (which is our frame for this problem), the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, so we have to account for time dilation maybe? Because if time is moving at different rates in the two frames, the distance would change.

So, I remember that in special relativity, time dilation occurs when two frames are moving relative to each other. The formula is t' = gamma * (t - (v x)/cÂ²), but since the movement is directly towards each other, the x component is along the direction of motion. Alternatively, since the velocities are along the same line, maybe it's simpler.

Wait, the problem states that both are inertial frames, so we can use the Lorentz transformation. Let me think about the situation.

In the ejecta's frame (let's call it S'), the galaxy's center is approaching at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at velocity u = 60,000 km/s towards the center.

We need to find the distance the ejecta travels (in S) during a time t' = 50 seconds (in S').

So, the distance in S would be u * t, but since t is not the same as t', we need to find the time in S.

Wait, but how do we relate t and t'? Using the Lorentz transformation. Since the events are the start and end of a 50-second interval in S
