Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions and the resulting NMR spectra. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. 

Heating this with KOH in excess at 240°C. Oh right! That sounds like a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms on the adamantane, when KOH is used, it should eliminate twice, probably forming an alkene. Wait, but since it's between 1 and 3 positions, the elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. So the product would be 1,3-didehydroadmatane? Or wait, maybe it's a diene? No, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules to form a conjugated diene. Because when you have vicinal dihalides (like adjacent Br), elimination typically forms alkenes. But with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond. Wait, no, wait—no, actually, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3. So during elimination, two HBr molecules are removed, likely forming a diene. Because each elimination would form a double bond, but with two bromines, two eliminations occur, leading to two double bonds? Or wait, perhaps it's a conjugated diene because of the positions. Alternatively, maybe it forms a single double bond if the structure allows, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) undergo elimination with strong base, they form alkenes. But in this case, the two bromines are on 1 and 3 positions, so not adjacent. So maybe each Br is eliminated separately. Oh wait, maybe each Br undergoes an elimination reaction, but since they're on different carbons, each elimination would form a double bond. So perhaps the product is a diene. But how? Let me think about the structure.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings
