Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 

Additionally, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is similar. The task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes in the molecule.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what Substance X is. It has a heavier isotope, so maybe it's an element with common isotopes. Also, it's used in organic chemistry as a reagent. Common reagents include things like H2O, but more likely something else. Wait, what about something like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7? Those are oxidizing agents. Or maybe it's something like H2SO4, but that's more of an acid.

Wait, but when it reacts with liquid Y, which could be something like water. The reaction is violent, so perhaps it's a metal reacting with an acid. Wait, but X is a substance, maybe it's an acid itself. Or maybe it's a metal. Let me think.

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So, the molecule must be something where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Because the molecule is a gas, it's likely to be a simple one. For example, H2O? No, because water isn't a gas under standard conditions. Wait, maybe it's CO2? No, because CO2 has 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol, but that's not relevant here. Wait, another thought: the gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think of possible molecules. 

Wait, maybe it's a noble gas? Because noble gases are monoatomic. So, say it's Argon (Ar), which has an atomic number of 18. So protons = 18, neutrons = 22 (since Argon's atomic mass is around 40, 40-18=22). Oh wait, but the question says the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for a monoatomic gas, protons would be the atomic number, and neutrons would be (mass number - atomic number). So, if the molecule is Ar (Ar has 18 protons and 22 neutrons), that's not equal. So maybe another gas.

Wait, what about carbon monoxide (CO)? No, because CO is a molecule, and the question says the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about each atom's contribution. CO has C (6 protons) and O (8 protons). So the molecule has 6+8=14 protons. For the neutrons, C has 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), O has 8 (if O-16). So total neutrons would be 14. Oh, wait, because 6+8=14. So protons=14, neutrons=14. Oh! So CO's molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that would fit. Because for each atom, the number of neutrons and protons may not be equal, but the sum for the molecule is.

Wait, but wait—each molecule of CO has one C and one O. So the molecule's total protons would be 6 (from C) +8 (from O) =14. Neutrons: C has 6 (in C-12), O has 8 (in O-16), so 6+8=14. So yes, that adds up. So gas W is CO?

But wait, CO is a gas, but under standard conditions, it's a colorless gas but doesn't react much. Alternatively, another molecule. Let me think: maybe H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons in H-1) and O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that doesn't work.

Another thought: maybe CH4? Wait, CH4 has 6 protons in C and 4 in H, so 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12), H has 0. So total neutrons 6. Not equal. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think about NH3. No, because it's not a gas at room temp? No, actually, wait, NH3 is a gas. Wait, no, NH3 is a gas at room temperature? Wait, no, NH3 is a gas at room temperature. Wait, but the molecule of NH3 has 14 protons (N:7, H:3×1=3; 7+3=10). Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (if N-14), H has 0. So 7×1 +0=7. No, not equal.

Hmm. Let me think again. Perhaps the molecule is something like NO. NO has 7 (N) +8 (O) =15 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 (if N-14), O has 8 (if O-16). So 7+8=15. Protons=15, neutrons=15. So yes, that would fit. So gas W is NO.

But wait, NO is a diatomic molecule, and when produced, it's a gas. But does it react with X? Not sure. I think I'm getting off track. Let me try to figure out the bigger picture.

The reaction: X reacts with Y (liquid) violently. The products are W (gas), G (precipitate), and when G is heated, B is released. B's melting point is about 277 K. Let's compute what that is. 277 K is about
