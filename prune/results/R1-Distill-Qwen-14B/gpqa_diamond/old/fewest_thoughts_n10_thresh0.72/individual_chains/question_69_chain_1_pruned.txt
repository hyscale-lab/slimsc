Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and its proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They want to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember something about proper lifetime and relativistic effects. Oh right, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The formula should be τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is given by E/(m c²), but wait, in units where c=1, E is in GeV and mass is also in GeV/c². So perhaps I can just calculate γ as E / m, since the units would work out with c=1.

So, E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by about 3.41. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, and 3.41*8 is 27.28. Oh, wait, 3.41*7.916 is 27. Because 3.41*8 is 27.28, so 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let's calculate it more accurately: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27-23.87=3.13. 3.13 /3.41 is about 0.917. So 7.917... approximately 7.917. So γ is about 7.917.

So the lifetime τ in the lab frame is γ * τ0. τ0 is 8e-16 s. So τ is 7.917 * 8e-16 = roughly 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So the distance L is velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ.

But what's the velocity? Since it's moving at relativistic speeds, v is approximately the speed of light c, which is about 3e8 m/s. So L ≈ c * τ.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s. Let me calculate that: 3 * 6.3336e-7 = 1.899e-6 meters. Wait, 3e8 * 6.3336e-15 = (3 * 6.3336) * 1e-7. 3*6 is 18, 3*0.3336 is about 1.0008
