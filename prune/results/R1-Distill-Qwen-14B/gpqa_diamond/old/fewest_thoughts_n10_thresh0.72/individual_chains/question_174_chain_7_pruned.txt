Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says an atomic nucleus with mass M is initially at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The combined rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm. Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest. When it splits, the two fragments must move in opposite directions due to conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, their momenta must cancel each other out.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: masses m1 and m2.
- m1 = 2 * m2 (because one is twice the other).
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.
Wait, no: the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So M_initial is the rest mass before fission, which is 300 GeV/cÂ², I guess.

So, M = m_initial = M. After fission, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Since m1 is twice m2, let's write m1 = 2 m2. Then, m1 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.99 M /3. m1 is 0.66 M? Wait, wait, 0.99 M divided by 3 is 0.33 M for m2, and m1 is twice that, so 0.66 M. So m1=0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

But wait, the initial mass was M, and the total rest mass after is 0.99 M. So the mass loss is 1% of M, which would be converted into kinetic energy or other forms (like binding energy, but in fission that energy is released as kinetic energy and other particles, but the problem says nothing else is produced, so I think all the mass difference goes into kinetic energy).

Wait, but the problem states that the sum of rest-masses is 99% of M. So the rest mass after fission is less than the initial. That implies energy was released, probably in the form of kinetic energy of the fragments.

So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. The sum after is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the mass difference is 3 GeV. So the total energy available is 3 GeV, which would be the sum of the kinetic energies plus any other energies (like gamma
