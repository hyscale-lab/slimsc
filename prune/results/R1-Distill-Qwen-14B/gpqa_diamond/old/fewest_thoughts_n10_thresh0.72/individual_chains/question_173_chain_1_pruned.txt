Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right?

The problem states that an electron is traveling at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE, of the electron. The options are A to D, each with different orders of magnitude.

Wait, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle says that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The formula for the Uncertainty Principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But since the question asks for the minimum uncertainty, I guess we can take the equality as the minimum case, so Δx * Δp = ħ/2. That makes sense because the uncertainty principle gives a lower bound.

So, first, I'll calculate Δp. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as h/(2π), right? So yeah, that's ħ. 

So, rearranging the formula, Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Let me plug in the numbers. Δx is 0.1 nm. Since 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. Wait, wait, no, 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters? Wait, no. 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m. Yes, that's right.

So, substituting the values: Δp = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ). Let me compute that. The denominator is 2e-10. So 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-10 is approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp is about 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now
