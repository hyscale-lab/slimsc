Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Hmm, I should check if these are normalized. Let me calculate the square of each and add them. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4), so 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yep, so it's a valid state.

The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh right, expectation value. So the operator is a sum of two Pauli matrices multiplied by constants. I remember that expectation values can be linear, so maybe I can split this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx, then add them together.

First, let's think about σz. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. For σz, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. So that might make things easier.

The expectation value of σz would be the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. So in this state, the probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and the probability of |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4. So the expectation value of σz is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's E[σz] = -0.5.

Then, 10 times that would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the tricky part is σx. I'm not as confident about this. I remember that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which flips the spin states. The matrix representation of σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, the eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But since our state isn't in the σx eigenbasis, I can't directly say the expectation value is something like 1 or -1. I'll need to compute it using the state given.

The expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me write this out. The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, the bra vector is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in the σz basis. The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I compute ψ† σx ψ, I can do it as a matrix multiplication.

Let me compute it step by step. The bra vector is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and the ket vector is also [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], but after applying σx. Wait, no, σx is applied to the ket vector first.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value using the components.

In general, for a spin-1/2 system, the expectation value of σx in a state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩ is given by 2 Re(α β*). Wait, or is it something else? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can compute it directly. The matrix for σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value is:

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = [0.5  sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ]

Let me compute this matrix multiplication step by step. First, multiply σx with |ψ⟩.

So, σx |ψ⟩ would be:

First component: (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2) → sqrt(3)/2
Second component: (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) → 0.5

So σx |ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Now, take the bra vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] and multiply by this.

So, (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5. Both terms are the same: (sqrt(3)/4) each. So together, that's (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... So 5 times that is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Wait, but wait, did I compute that correctly? Because I'm a bit unsure. Let me double-check. Another approach: the expectation value can also be found using the formula 2 Re(α β*), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, remember that for a spin-1/2 particle, σx is the same as the operator that when you measure, you get +1 or -1 with certain probabilities.

Alternatively, another way of calculating ⟨σx⟩ is to note that for a state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩, the expectation value is 2 Re(α β*). Wait, is that correct? Because when you have |α|^2 and |β|^2 for probabilities, but the cross terms may involve the product.

Wait, I think the correct formula is ⟨σx⟩ = 2 ( |α|^2 - |β|^2 )? No, wait, no. Because, for spin in the x-direction, the expectation value is the probability of spin-up along x minus the probability of spin-down along x. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me perhaps think in terms of the eigenstates.

The eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ = (|↑⟩ +
