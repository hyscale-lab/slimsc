Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stability constants and complexation equilibria. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes among all the cobalt species. The options are A to D, with percentages in the 16-42% range.

Wait, what's the blue dithiocyanato complex? I remember that in the case of Co(II), the [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) complexes have different colors depending on n. I think the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is the blue one, maybe the dithiocyanato complex. So that's the species we're interested in, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), which is Co with two SCN ligands.

Stability constants (β) are given for each complex. The stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and the ligands. So for each complex, the higher the β, the more stable it is.

The general approach here is to calculate the concentrations of each complex and the free Co^2+ ion, then find the fraction that is the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^(2+)).

But wait, how do I model the formation of these complexes? Let me think.

The species present in solution are:

- Free Co^2+ (Co²+)
- Monocomplex: [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
- Dicomplex: [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} (n=2)
- Tricomplex: [Co(SCN)_3]^0 (n=3)
- Tetracomplex: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4)

Each of these complexes forms stepwise. The formation of each complex depends on the previous ones. So the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^{
