Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions and then chromatography results. Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an epoxidizing agent. It adds an epoxide group across a double bond.

So the reactions are on (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Let me think about the products.

Epoxidation of a double bond typically leads to an epoxide. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening. Wait, how does that happen? I think the ring-opening of epoxides under acidic conditions usually leads to diols. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then the ring opens with water attacking the more substituted carbon, following the more stable carbocation that forms.

But wait, the initial structure is oct-4-ene. So for both the E and Z isomers, adding mCPBA would form epoxides. Then, acid work-up gives diols. Let me draw the structures.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond between carbons 4 and 5. The E isomer has the higher priority groups on opposite sides, and the Z has them on the same side. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The epoxide will be on carbons 4 and 5.

Wait, but after epoxidation, the configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting geometry. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the two substituents (CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH3, but perhaps more accurately, the substituents on each end) are opposite. So the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms in a certain configuration.

But when the epoxide is treated with acid, it will open. The ring-opening can lead to different diastereomers depending on the starting epoxide structure. Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene would have a certain stereochemistry, and the same for (Z).

Wait, when you epoxidize (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the
