Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about determining the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, okay.

First, let's break down the structure. A 6-membered aromatic ring means it's something like benzene, but with two substituents. The compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene itself is 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Wait, but waitâ€”each substituent can contribute more than one carbon. Oh wait, no, the total is 8, so substituents plus the ring. So 6 from benzene, substituents add 2, so each substituent adds one carbon? Or maybe one substituent adds two and the other adds none. Wait, but di-substituted means two substituents, each attached to the ring. So one substituent could be a single carbon group, like a methyl, and the other might be another group. Or maybe both substituents are such that they add up to two carbons.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. So one of the substituents must be a carbonyl group. Carbonyl groups could be like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen,
