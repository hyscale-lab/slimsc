Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that's either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but propene is more likely because when I think of bromination in CCl4, that's a typical addition reaction. Oh wait, cyclopropane would also undergo bromination, but maybe via a different mechanism. But let me think: C3H6 as propene (CH2=CH2CH3) or maybe another isomer. Wait, propene is C3H6, correct. So maybe that's the starting point.

So Compound A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3). Okay, now it undergoes bromination in CCl4. Oh right, that's an addition reaction. Propene with bromine would add across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, when propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with Br2 in CCl4, it's a diaddition. The bromine adds across the double bond, so the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Structure would be BrCH2CHBrCH3.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and heat, so that's likely an elimination reactionâ€”E2. So 1,2-dibromopropane with KOH would eliminate HBr. Wait, but since both Br are adjacent, which one leaves? Wait, when you have two adjacent leaving groups, like Br on adjacent carbons, elimination can happen in either way. But for 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would form either propene or maybe another alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination, but I think more likely, it would form 1-propene again, but wait, or another product.

Wait, wait. 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3) reacting with alcoholic KOH. So the base would deprotonate a beta hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and another Br-? Or perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons, so when one Br leaves as Br-, the adjacent Br is a leaving group too. Wait, no, the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, which is adjacent to a Br. So the mechanism is E2: the base abstracts a hydrogen, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond. But since there are two Br atoms, which structure will we get?

Wait, let me think. The structure is Br-CH2-CHBr-CH3. So when the base abstracts a hydrogen from the middle CHBr (like the middle CH2?), wait no, the Br are on the first and second carbons. So the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Hmm, during elimination, to form an alkene, adjacent Brs would eliminate. So the possible alkenes would be either between C1 and C2 (but both have Br) or C2 and C3. Wait, no, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, which would be propene (but that's same as the starting material), or between C2 and C3.

Wait, but wait. Let's think: if you have BrCH2-CHBr-CH3, and you eliminate HBr twice. So possible elimination could form either 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) or maybe something else. Wait, but in this case, perhaps the major product is 1-propene again. But wait, that seems possible but perhaps another product is formed. Alternatively, maybe the product is 2-bromopropene, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps when two Br are adjacent, elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons, but wait, in this case
