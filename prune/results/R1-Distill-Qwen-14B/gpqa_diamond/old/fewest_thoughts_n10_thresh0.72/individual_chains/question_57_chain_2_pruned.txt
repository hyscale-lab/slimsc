Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember from my studies that scattering amplitudes involve some kind of expansion with phase shifts. Let me think...

The given phase shifts are delta_0 =90 degrees, delta_1=67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, delta_4=13 degrees. And the rest are ignored. The electrons have 50 MeV energy. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a series involving the phase shifts. The formula, if I remember correctly, is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum [ (2l +1) * e^{i δ_l} * sin δ_l ] * P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Oh right, and k is the wave number.

But wait, the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. The incident beam direction would be θ=0 degrees, I suppose. So cosθ is 1, and which Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are non-zero?

I recall that P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1 regardless of l. So for each term, P_l(1) =1. That simplifies things.

Now, the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be the imaginary part of each term summed together. Because the overall factor is (1/k) multiplied by each term. So let's break it down.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) * e^{i δ_l} * sin δ_l. Wait, no, the actual term is (2l+1) * e^{i δ_l} * (sin δ_l) because the sine comes from the expansion. Wait, no, let me think again. The formula is f(theta) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l (cosθ). Because e^{i δ} = cos δ + i sin δ. So when you take the imaginary part, each term contributes the
