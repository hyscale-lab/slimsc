Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, A undergoes monobromination to form B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. We need to find out what D is from the given options.

First, I should figure out what Compound A is. The NMR data can give me some clues. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H probably indicates two sets of equivalent CH3 groups. Since triplets in NMR are usually due to coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe these are adjacent to a CH2 group. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H likely comes from a CH2 group that's next to another CH2, perhaps part of a -CH2CH2- structure.

Putting this together, I'm thinking of a compound where two CH3 groups are attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. Wait, so maybe it's a diethyl ether structure? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, it could be a cyclopropane derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the triplet is from two equivalent CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about splitting. For a triplet, each proton in the group must be next to a group with two protons. So for example, a CH2 group next to another CH2 would have each proton seeing two neighbors. So each CH2's protons would be a quartet because they're split by two neighboring protons. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, wait. Let me double-check NMR splitting.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H: each of those protons is next to a CH2 group. So, each of the CH3 groups is adjacent to a CH2. So, for example, maybe two CH3 groups attached to a central CH2, which in turn is connected to another CH2. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of ethyl groups. An ethyl group's CH3 would be a triplet because it's next to a CH2 with two protons. Wait, no, the CH3 in an ethyl group would be a triplet because each of its protons is next to the adjacent CH2's two protons. So the triplet integrates to 3H, but the question has 6H for the triplet. Oh, so that might mean two sets of ethyl groups. Like two ethyl groups attached somewhere.

If that's the case, the structure could be a diethyl something. Diethyl ether, perhaps? Diethyl ether has two ethyl groups attached to oxygen. The NMR of diethyl ether would have the CH3 groups as a triplet because each is next to a CH2. And the CH2 groups would be a quartet because each is next
