Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and think through each part carefully.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They were heated to 200°C without air, and this caused a mixture of gases to form. These gases were passed through three tubes: the first with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gained 3.60g, tube 3 gained 0.80g, and tube 2 didn't change in weight. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained under standard temperature and pressure (STP).

Hmm, I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are given, so maybe I can figure out what the salts are based on the reactions.

Let me start by understanding what each tube does. 

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong drying agent. It's probably absorbing water if any is present. So if the gas after heating contains water vapor, Mg(ClO4)2 would trap it, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of the water.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas had any acidic gases like CO2 or HCl, they would react with the solution. But here, the weight didn't change, meaning no such gases were present. So the gas mixture didn't have CO2 or HCl.

Tube 3 has red-hot copper. It would react with any water vapor (if present) upon heating. The reaction is 2 H2O + 4 Cu → 2 CuO + 2 H2 + 2 Cu (maybe I should write the correct equation). Wait, no, I think it's 2 H2O + 4 Cu → 2 CuO + 2 H2↑. So if water was present, it would react, and the mass gain would be due to the CuO formed. The tube's weight increased by 0.80g, so that's the mass of CuO formed.

Wait, but I thought tube 1 and tube 3 both deal with water. Let me clarify. If water is present in the gas mixture, it would be absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2 in tube 1. But if there's excess water beyond what tube 1 can trap, then when it passes through tube 3 (red-hot Cu), it would react, producing H2 and CuO. But in our case, tube 1 gained 3.60g, and tube 3 gained 0.80g. So perhaps the gas contained both water vapor and another gas that doesn't react with these tubes.

Wait, but the initial heating of the salts without air suggests decomposition, possibly producing H2O and some other gases.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the salts are nitrates. When heated, nitrates decompose. For example, nitrates (like NaNO3) might decom
