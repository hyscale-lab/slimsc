Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, first, I should remember what each of these symmetries means. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it includes both the Lorentz group and the translations in spacetime—that's like the overall symmetry of Minkowski spacetime.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories usually don't have some of the symmetries of the full theory because they're approximations. So, for SMEFT, which is built from the Standard Model, I think the starting point is that the SM respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT should maintain those unless modified by the operators.

The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry. Because SMEFT is an extension that includes higher-dimensional operators, but these operators should still preserve Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations (momentum conservation). Well, Poincare symmetry would imply things like momentum conservation. But wait, when you have higher-dimensional operators, like in SMEFT, do they necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry? Hmm, maybe not. Because when you include higher-dimension terms, those terms could have non-zero vacuum expectation values or some explicit breaking, but wait, in SMEFT, the operators are added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, which already respects Poincare. So as long as the SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, they should maintain Lorentz symmetry and hence be part of a Poincare-invariant theory. So I think Poincare symmetry is also respected. So options 1 and 2 are both correct. Wait, but wait—Poincare symmetry might be a broader concept. Because Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare, but if the operators don't respect the full Poincare, would that be a problem? I'm a bit confused. Or maybe Poincare is automatically respected because the theory
