Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me try to visualize the structure. 

Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). That's a meta arrangement between ethoxy and nitro, but wait, nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl), making it a para arrangement with position 1. Hmm, maybe I should draw the benzene ring and mark these positions.

The question gives four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence would lead to the target molecule with high yield. Let's think about each step.

First, benzene is the starting material. The substituents are tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. So, we need to introduce these groups in the correct positions through electrophilic substitution reactions.

Remember that each substitution directs the next substitution based on activating or deactivating groups. Activating groups (like -OEt, ethoxy) are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups (like nitro) are meta directors. Also, tert-butyl is bulky, so it might influence the regiochemistry.

Let's break down the target molecule:

- Ethoxy group (-OEt) is an activating group, so it would direct incoming substituents to ortho and para positions.
- Nitro groups are deactivating and meta-directing.
- tert-Butyl is an activating, bulky group, so it's an ortho/para director but tends to favor para due to steric hindrance.

Wait, but the order of introduction matters. Let's think about the order of substituents being added. Which substituent is introduced first, second, third?

In synthesis planning, the order is crucial. Nitration is typically done after activating groups because nitro is a strong deactivating group. Similarly, ethoxylation (like ethoxy group) is often done earlier because it's activating and can direct the next substituents.

But wait, the target has three substituents. So, let's see: benzene must undergo three substitution reactions to get all three groups.

Wait, the target has nitro group at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, let me imagine the benzene ring: positions 1, 2, 3. So, positions 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the positions in terms of numbering. Let me number the ring with ethoxy at position 1, then tert-butyl at 2 (which is ortho to ethoxy), and nitro at 3 (which is meta to ethoxy or ortho to tert-butyl? Hmm. Or perhaps the nitro is in
