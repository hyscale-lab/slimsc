Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1, which makes sense because p orbitals have l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. 

Ignoring spin angular momentum, we're told to find the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So, each electron's Lz component is measured, and the question is what's the probability that both are -ħ.

First, I need to recall how angular momentum coupling works. When you have two angular momenta, you can couple them in two ways: either you add them together to get the total angular momentum, or you might consider them separately. Here, the state is given in terms of the total angular momentum, so I think we have to express it in terms of the product states of individual L1z and L2z.

Wait, the state is a coupled state, which means it's in terms of the total angular momentum quantum numbers. So to find the probability of L1z and L2z having certain values, I need to express the state in terms of their individual components. I remember that when you have a coupled state |l1, l2, l, m>, you can expand it in terms of the product states |l1, m1⟩|l2, m2⟩ where m1 + m2 = m. But wait, in this case, m is the total m, so m = m1 + m2.

In the given state, m is -1. So when we expand into the product states, each term will have m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. 

The individual states for each electron are p orbitals, so l1=1 and l2=1. So the possible m1 and m2 values for each are -1, 0, +1. 

The expansion of the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> would involve all possible combinations of m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1. Let's list the possible
