Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and calculating the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 through radiative corrections. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The Lagrangian given includes some terms I'm familiar with. Let me parse it. The first term is i times the conjugate of NR gamma^mu partial_mu NR. That's a Dirac term for a right-handed neutrino or some singlet fermion, I think. Then there's a kinetic term for phi, a gauge covariant derivative term for S, which is a doublet scalar. Oh wait, S is a doublet, so maybe it's part of the Higgs sector.

Next, there are terms like y_i/2 * phi * N_iR^c N_iR^c. So that's a Yukawa coupling term, making the singlet fermions get mass from phi. Then a D^mu S squared term, which is the gauge kinetic term for the scalar doublet S. Then the term with g_{i alpha} bar N_iR L_alpha S. So that's like a Yukawa interaction where the singlets couple to the lepton doublets L and the scalar S. Interesting, so maybe this is a type of seesaw mechanism setup?

Wait, the singlet fermions are N_iR, which are (1,1,0) under SU(2), SU(3), U(1). The scalar S is a doublet, so (1,2,1) I think. And phi is a singlet scalar, (1,1,0). Their vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given with <phi>^2 = x² + v², where <phi> is x and <h> is v. Wait, wait, maybe h is another field? Or perhaps the Higgs is H, and phi is another scalar. Hmm, the problem says phi's VEV is x, and <h> is v. So perhaps H is another Higgs field, maybe the SM Higgs, and phi is a different scalar?

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2.
