Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll take it step by step.

The question involves benzene undergoing a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the final product. Let's break down each step.

First step: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitration is a common reaction where benzene reacts with concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid as a catalyst. Nitration adds a nitro group. Benzene is meta-directing, so the nitro group would go into the meta position. Wait, no, wait. Actually, when benzene undergoes nitration, the nitro group is a meta director because it's a strong deactivating group. So the product after nitration (product 1) should have the nitro group in the meta position relative to where it was attached. But wait, benzene is symmetric, so the product would have the nitro group in the para position? No, wait. Wait, wait. When benzene nitrates, the nitro group can go into the ortho, meta, or para positions, but the major product is the meta due to the stability of the intermediate. Hmm, wait noâ€”I think the nitration of benzene typically gives a mixture, but the major product is the meta isomer. But actually, I might be mixing this up. Benzene is actually activated in the sense that it's a planar molecule, but the nitro group is a meta director
