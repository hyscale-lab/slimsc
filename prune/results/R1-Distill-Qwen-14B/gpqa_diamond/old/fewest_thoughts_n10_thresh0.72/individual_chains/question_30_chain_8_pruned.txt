Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about dyes and the colors they absorb. Hmm, I've studied a bit about this before, but let me think it through step by step.

The question says that a textile dye with an extensively conjugated pi-electrons system emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. And the question is asking what color it absorbs. Wait, wait, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. So if it's emitting at a specific energy, maybe that relates to what it absorbed?

Wait, no. Wait, when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap between the ground state and excited state. So the energy of the emitted light would be related to that gap. But wait, I'm a bit confused. The dye emits light when it goes from an excited state back to the ground state. So the emitted light's energy is the same as the energy gap? Or maybe not exactly, because sometimes the molecule might emit a lower energy photon, but that's when there's a possibility of multiple transitions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I also remember that the color we see is the complementary color of the absorbed light. So if a dye absorbs blue light, it would appear orange because blue and orange are complementary. But wait, the question is about what color is absorbed, not what color is emitted.

So the problem gives the energy of the emitted light. So I think I should find the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV, then determine what color that is,
