Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. 

So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that move at ultra-relativistic velocities, with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector inner walls?

Wait, so when the Lorentz factor is 20, only one third reach the detector. We need to find the new Lorentz factor where two-thirds reach. 

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma affects the lifetime of particles from our perspective. Because particles moving at relativistic speeds experience time dilation. So from the lab frame (the detector's frame), the particles will live longer than their proper lifetime. 

So, the proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The observed lifetime in the lab is gamma multiplied by τ. 

The distance a particle travels before decaying is velocity times lifetime. The velocity is approximately the speed of light since it's ultra-relativistic. So the distance L is approximately c multiplied by gamma τ.

Wait, but the detector is a sphere with radius R. So, for a particle to reach the wall, the distance it must travel is R. So, in the case where gamma is 20, only one third reach the wall. That suggests that the average lifetime might be such that the distance they travel is about R, but maybe not all of them manage to do so.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the probability of a particle reaching the wall. If a particle decays after traveling a distance D, the probability that D is greater than or equal to R is the fraction that reach the wall. So maybe it's a question of the average lifetime and how much of the time the particle lives longer than R/(c).

Wait, but particles are moving at a speed close to c, so let's model this. Let me define τ as the proper lifetime. Then the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma τ. The average distance a particle travels before decaying is gamma τ c. But wait, it's not exactly average. Because the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability that the distance d = v t (since v ≈ c) is greater than R is exp(-R/(gamma tau c)).

Wait, so the survival probability P is exp(-R/(gamma tau c)). 

In the given scenario, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the wall. So P = 1/3. 

So,

1/3 = exp( - R/(20 tau c) )

Taking natural log on both sides,

ln(1/3) = - R/(20 tau c )

So,

- ln(3) = - R/(20 tau c )

So,

ln(3) = R/(20 tau c )

Multiply both sides by 20 tau c,

20 tau c ln(3) = R

So,

tau = R / (20 c ln(3) )

Wait, but what is
