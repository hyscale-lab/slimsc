Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When it doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition corresponds to 1448 Ã…, and we're assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm. So, I remember that the number of atoms in different energy levels in a gas is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of ( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where E2 is higher than E1. So, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight.

In the star's photosphere, without spots, the Teff is 6000 K. With spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but wait. Do the spots cause the entire star's photosphere to cool, or just the spotted regions? Because spots are cooler regions, but the rest is at higher Teff.

Wait, the problem says, when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So, the entire photosphere's average Teff is lower when spots are present. I think that in this case, the entire photosphere is considered to have an effective temperature of 5500 K when spots are present. Because the question says the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K.

But wait, no, that might not be accurate. Because dark spots are cooler regions. The effective temperature is an average based on the total emitted flux. So, if part of the surface is cooler, the overall Teff would be lower
