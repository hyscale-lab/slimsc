Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The astronomers assume the stars radiate as black bodies and computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. The options are A to D with some numbers.

Hmm, I remember that luminosity for stars is related to their radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, this should apply.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the peak emission wavelength is the same. I recall Wien's Law, which states that λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_max is the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Oh, because λ_max = (constant)/T. So T for both stars is the same?

If that's the case, then the temperature factors would cancel out. So the luminosity would depend on R squared, since L is proportional to R² T⁴. If T is the same, then L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) * (T1^4)/(T2^4). But since T1=T2, that becomes (R1/R2)^2.

R1 is 1.5 times R2. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2? So the factor would be 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. The question mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Does that matter here? Because radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right, but the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the emitted wavelengths are the same, but the observed wavelengths might be different due to Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths determined (presumably the observed wavelengths) are the same. Oh, so if the stars are moving, their emission lines are Doppler-shifted, but the observed λ_max is the same. Hmm, that complicates things.

Because normally, the temperature determines λ_max. But if one star is moving towards or away from us, its observed λ_max would be different. But in this case, they have the same observed λ_max, so the Doppler shift must be taking into account.

Wait, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 7
