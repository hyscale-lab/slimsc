Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So the dot product with n would involve each component multiplied by the corresponding direction of n. Like, σ · n = σx n_x + σy n_y + σz n_z.

Wait, but when you compute the eigenvalues of such an operator, the specific direction of n shouldn't matter because the eigenvalues depend on the magnitude, not the direction. Because the Hamiltonian is a spin operator in some arbitrary direction, but the eigenvalues should be the same regardless of which direction n is pointing.

I recall that the eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix σ·n are plus and minus 1. Oh wait, but wait—each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, right? But here the Hamiltonian is scaled by ε. So maybe the eigenvalues are ε multiplied by those values. Like, ±ε?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are 2x2, and when you have σ·n, it's a traceless matrix. The trace of σ·n would be zero because each component's trace is zero. The eigenvalues of such a matrix should sum to zero. So what are the possible eigenvalues? They must be +λ and -λ for some λ.

But what's λ here? The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So for σ·n, since the vector n is a unit vector, the magnitude of σ·n operator would be 1 times some factor? Because n is a unit vector, the maximum eigenvalue is 1? So the eigenvalues of σ·n are +1 and -1. So H would be ε multiplied by that, so eigenvalues would be ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), which is ε and -ε. So the eigenvalues are plus and minus ε.

Looking at the options: option B is +ε, -ε. That's probably the right answer. But wait, wait—I remember that sometimes spin operators are multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, I think in some conventions, the spin operator is (σ/2), so that the eigenvalues are ±
