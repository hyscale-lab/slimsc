Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured the spin many times on identical systems. 

The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a two-component vector representing the spinor. So it's written as a column vector, right? So χ = [3i, 4]^T. Or maybe it's written as (3i,4), which is the same as a column vector with 3i in the first component and 4 in the second. 

The operator for spin in the y-direction is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2, I think. Oh wait, σ_y is given as a matrix:

σ_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The expectation value formula is <S_y> = χ† S_y χ. Oh wait, because for expectation value in quantum mechanics, you take the conjugate transpose of the state, multiply by the operator, then by the state again.

Wait, but the state is given as (3i,4). So first, I need to write χ as a column vector. So χ is a column vector with elements 3i and 4. So χ = [3i; 4]. 

Then, the conjugate transpose χ† would be [ -3 (because (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, the conjugate of 3i is -3i. Wait, let's think. The conjugate of a complex number a + ib is a - ib. So if χ is (3i,4), then the first component is 3i, which is 0 + 3i. Its conjugate is 0 - 3i, which is -3i. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 3i is already purely imaginary. So the conjugate of 3i is -3i. So the conjugate transpose χ† would be a row vector [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait, no, wait. The original vector is (3i,4), so when you take the conjugate, each component's conjugate is taken. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 (which is real) stays 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, actually, wait. The state is (3i, 4), so when you take the conjugate transpose, the first component becomes the conjugate of 3i, which is -3i, and the second becomes the conjugate of 4, which is 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait no, wait again. No, wait, the vector (3i,4) is a column vector. So χ = [3i; 4]. Then, χ† is [3i*, 4*], which is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector, right.

So now, compute χ† multiplied by S_y, then by χ.

Alternatively, since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, maybe I can compute the expectation value without the factors first and then multiply by ħ/2.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, compute χ† σ_y χ.

Compute σ_y χ first. Let me compute that matrix multiplication.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply σ_y by χ (which is [3i;4]), the result is:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3. So the second component is -3.

So σ_y χ = [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, multiply χ† by σ_y χ. χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

That would be (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, so χ† σ_y χ = -24.

Then, the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this value.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options given, because the options have denominators like 25. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, let me go back and double-check each step.

Wait, the state is (3i,4), correct? So χ is [3i;4].

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So σ_y χ is:

First element: 0 * 3i + (-i) * 4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second element: (i) *3i + 0*4 = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3. So that's correct.

So σ_y χ = [ -4i; -3 ]

Then, χ† is [3i^*, 4^* ] = [ -3i, 4 ].

Multiplying χ† times σ_y χ:

(-3i) * (-4i) + 4 * (-3).

Compute each part:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12 (-1) = -12.

4 * (-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So χ† σ_y χ is -24.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar /25, which is like - (12/25) ħ.

Wait, so where did I go wrong? Because my calculation gives -12 ħ, but the options have factors with 25 in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the state vector. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the state vector is normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, so the inner product of the state with itself should be 1.

Wait, let me compute the norm of the given state: |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25.

So the norm is sqrt(25) =5. So the state is not normalized. So perhaps the actual state is (3i,4)/5, because that would make the norm 1.

Wait, the problem statement says the spin state is (3i,4). So maybe I should normalize it before computing the expectation value.

Ah, that's probably where the 25 comes in.

So the correct state is χ = [3i;4] / sqrt(25) = [3i;4]/5.

Because the state vectors are usually normalized. So I should have used χ = [3i/5; 4/5].

Ah, that's the mistake. I didn't normalize the state. So I need to redo the calculation with the normalized vector.

So let me correct that.

So χ is [3i/5; 4/5].

Thus, χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Now, compute σ_y χ.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

σ_y χ = [0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) , i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) ].

So first component: 0 + (-i)(4/5) = (-4i)/5.

Second component: i*(3i)/5 + 0 = (3i²)/5 = 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5.

So σ_y χ = [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ].

Now, χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Now, compute χ† (σ_y χ ):

Multiply each element:

(-3i/5) * (-4i/5) + (4/5) * (-3/5).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (12 i² ) /25 = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (4/5)*(-3/5) = (-12)/25.

Adding them together: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

So χ† σ_y χ = (-24)/25.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the order of multiplication. Because when you compute χ† (σ_y χ), the multiplication is (row vector) multiplied by (column vector), so each component is:

sum_{k} (χ†)_k (σ_y χ)_k.

Wait, so in this case, χ† is [ a, b ], and σ_y χ is [ c, d ]^T. So the product is a*c + b*d.

Which is what I did.

So a = (-3i/5 ), c = (-4i/5 ), so a*c is (-3i/5)(-4i/5) = (12 i²)/(25) = (12 * (-1) )/(25) = -12/25.

b = 4/5, d = (-3/5), so b*d = (4/5)(-3/5) )= -12/25.

So sum is (-12/25) + (-12/25) )= -24/25.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ ) /25.

Wait, that's option A.

The options are:

A) -12*hbar/25

B) 12*hbar/25

C) 25*hbar/2

D) -25*hbar/2

So the correct answer is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( \langle S_y \rangle \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalize the state**: The given state \( \chi = (3i, 4) \) is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:
   \[
   \|\chi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   \chi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Spin operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is:
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y, \quad \text{where } \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Compute \( \sigma_y \chi \)**: Multiply \( \sigma_y \) by the normalized state \( \chi \):
   \[
   \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i/5 \\ 4/5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i/5 \\ -3/5 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \chi^\dagger (\sigma_y \chi) \)**: The conjugate transpose of \( \chi \) is:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i/5 & 4/5 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Multiply \( \chi^\dagger \) by \( \sigma_y \chi \):
   \[
   \chi^\dagger (\sigma_y \chi) = \begin{pmatrix} -3i/5 & 4/5 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i/5 \\ -3/5 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Compute the terms:
   \[
   (-3i/5)(-4i/5) = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{-12}{25}, \quad (4/5)(-3/5) = \frac{-12}{25}.
   \]
   Adding these gives:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger (\sigma_y \chi) = \frac{-12}{25} + \frac{-12}{25} = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

5. **Expectation value**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \chi^\dagger (\sigma_y \chi) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final answer**: Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \text{A) } \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

Answer: A
