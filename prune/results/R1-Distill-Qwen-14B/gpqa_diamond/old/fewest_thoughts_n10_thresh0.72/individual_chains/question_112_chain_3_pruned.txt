Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, such that it is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given by elements A_ij, where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to probably normalize the state |alpha>, because it's given as proportional to those terms. Then, I should find the eigenstates of the operator A. Once I have the eigenstates, I can express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates and compute the probabilities. Finally, calculate the expectation value.

Wait, let me break it down. The operator A has a matrix where diagonal elements are zero and off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because for a 2x2 matrix, i and j run from 1 to 2. So when iâ‰ j, A_ij is hbar/2, else zero.

Wait, so what's the operator A? It looks like a spin-flip operator, maybe. Because it's like sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2. Since sigma_x has off-diagonal elements 1 and 0 on the diagonal. So A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

Right, because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (hbar/2) sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates of A are the same, because it's a multiple of sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues (hbar/2)*1
