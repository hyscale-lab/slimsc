Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a transmission electron microscope. Let me read through it again.

Mike is working on a high-resolution TEM that's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The reason for this is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron microscopy by scattering the electrons.

Even though he did this, some gas particles are still present, as detected by a mass spectrometer. So Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules, which he called λ1. The mean free path depends on factors like the compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. 

But then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes to λ2, which isn't the same as λ1. And the temperature is still the same, so that can't be the reason for the change.

Hmm. I remember that the mean free path of gas molecules is influenced by the pressure. Oh wait, but Mike had already accounted for that when calculating λ1. So why is there a change when the electron beam is on?

Wait, wait. The mean free path in the absence of the electron beam is λ1. But when the electron beam is active, maybe the gas molecules are being ionized or excited by the electrons. If the gas is ionized, the mean free path might change because charged particles interact differently.

In the ultra-high vacuum, the primary scattering mechanisms are usually from the gas molecules. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas ions or electrons produced by the beam interact with the gas molecules, changing their effective cross-section for scattering. 

I recall that the mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of the gas, and σ is the effective scattering cross-section. So if the cross-section increases, the mean free path would decrease.

Why would the cross-section increase when the electron beam is on? Because now, the gas molecules might be ionized. Ionized gas molecules have a larger effective cross-section because they carry charges, so they're more likely to interact with other particles or the electron beam itself.

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path becomes λ2 instead of λ1. So if λ2 is
