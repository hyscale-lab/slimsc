Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it says. Hmm, the question is about reactions involving mCPBA and the products formed, then analyzing them via HPLC.

First, the reactions: Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, then aqueous acid. Reaction 2 is (Z)-oct-4-ene treated similarly. Both go to 100% completion, so no side products. Then the products are combined and run on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns.

I need to figure out what the HPLC chromatograms will show. The options are about the number of peaks in each case.

Wait, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? It's a peracid, commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction conditions after that are important too. Oh, right, after epoxidation, sometimes there's an acid work-up. Wait, but mCPBA is usually used under specific conditions. Oh, wait, no, mCPBA typically does the epoxidation, and then maybe they do something else. Wait, maybe after the epoxidation, hydrolysis occurs?

Wait, but in this case, the reagent is mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Hmm, so after the epoxidation, perhaps the epoxide is opened under acidic conditions. Because mCPBA adds an epoxide, and then acid work-up could lead to ring opening.

Wait, so let me think. mCPBA adds an epoxide across the double bond. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide would undergo acid-catalyzed ring opening. That would form a diol. So for each alkene, E and Z, the epoxide would form, and then under acidic conditions, it would open to form a diol.

Wait, but the structure of the diol depends on the starting alkene and the stereochemistry of the epoxide. So, for each starting geometry (E and Z), the epoxide would form with a certain configuration, and upon acid treatment, the diol would form.

Let's think about oct-4-ene. Structure is CH2CH2 in the middle for both E and Z.

Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with opposite groups on either end. So when mCPBA reacts, it forms an epoxide. Then, the epoxide ring opens under acid conditions. The ring opening of epoxides under acidic conditions typically occurs via a mechanism where the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the nucleophile (water, in this case) attacks the less substituted carbon because the more substituted carbocation is more stable.

Wait, wait, in the epoxide, the two carbons that were the double bond carbons are now connected by an oxygen. When the epoxide opens, the acid would protonate one of the oxygen's lone pairs, making it a better leaving group. Then, a water molecule would attack either the more substituted or less substituted carbon, depending on the conditions.

Wait, but in the acid-catalyzed opening of epoxides, the nucleophile (water) usually attacks the more substituted carbon because the carbocation formed there is more stable. Wait, wait, no, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. In acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening, the protonation makes the epoxide oxygen positively charged. Then the nucleophile (water) attacks the less substituted carbon because that leads to a more stable carbocation. No, wait, no, the more substituted carbocation is more stable, so the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon. Because the transition state or the carbocation is more stabilized when it's on a more substituted carbon.

Wait, so in an epoxide derived from (E)-oct-4-ene, what's the structure? The epoxide would bridge carbons 4 and 5 (since oct-4-ene is between 4 and 5). So the starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene: structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2, maybe. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 at the 4 and 5 positions. So, the structure is CH2CH2, but with substituents on either side. For (E), the substituents on each double bond carbon are opposite each other.

Wait, but when mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide with the stereochemistry determined by the starting alkene. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form with a specific stereochemistry, and similarly for (Z).

Wait, but when the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it opens to form a diol. Let me visualize the epoxide structure. So, for both E and Z alkenes, the epoxide would be similar but with different configurations.

Let me think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide, then H3O+ → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide, then H3O+ → diol.

But wait, when the epoxide is formed, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide. Then, when it opens under acid conditions, each epoxide would form different diastereomers or maybe enantiomers, depending on the starting material.

Wait, let's think about (E)-oct-4-ene. The structure is CH2CH2 with substituents opposite each other. So, when mCPBA adds, it would form an epoxide where the oxygen is between the two CH2 groups, but with a specific stereochemistry. Then, when treated with acid, the epoxide opens to form a diol.

Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a different epoxide.

Wait, but wait, the ring-opening of the epoxide under acidic conditions depends on the epoxide's structure. Let me consider the specific structures.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is trans. When mCPBA adds, the epoxide would have the same configuration as the starting alkene because mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond in a syn addition. Wait, no, wait: Actually, mCPBA adds in a syn fashion. For a trans double bond (E), adding the oxygen in a syn addition would result in an epoxide where the two new oxygen bonds are on the same face. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think again.

Wait, the addition of mCPBA to a double bond is a peracid adding an epoxide group across the double bond. The addition is a concerted process where the peracid oxygen attacks the less substituted side, but the exact mechanism is a bit fuzzy. I think that the addition is syn, so the groups add on the same face. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, which has substituents opposite each other on the double bond, the addition of the oxygen would result in the two oxygen atoms being added on the same face, leading to an epoxide with a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to model it. Let's say the (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 with substituents on each side of the double bond. Let's say each double bond carbon (C4 and C5) has two CH2 groups. So, for (E), the substituents (the CH2 groups) are on opposite sides.

When mCPBA adds, it adds an oxygen bridge across the double bond, so C4 and C5 are now connected via an oxygen. The addition is syn, so the two new bonds (from the mCPBA O) form on the same face of the double bond. So, for the (E) isomer, the substituents are on opposite sides; adding the oxygen in a syn fashion would result in the two CH2 groups on C4 and C5 being on the same side, leading to a cis or trans epoxide? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the resulting epoxide structure. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed would have the two new substituents (from the oxygen) on the same face, leading to a trans epoxide? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the (E) double bond leads to a cis epoxide, and (Z) leads to another configuration.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide's geometry depends on the starting alkene's geometry. Because mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, so the two new oxygens are added on the same face. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, which has opposite substituents, the syn addition would create a trans epoxide. Wait, wait, no. Maybe for (E)-oct-4-ene, the addition of the oxygen on the same face would result in a cis epoxide. Because the substituents were trans, adding the same face would make them adjacent. Let me think of 2-pentene.

Wait, okay, perhaps an example would help. Let's take (E)-2-pentene, which is CH2CH2 with substituents on either end. Suppose the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, (E)-2-pentene is CH2CH2 with groups on opposite sides. If mCPBA adds a syn epoxide, the oxygen connects C2 and C3, and the two new oxygen bonds are on the same face. So, for (E)-2-pentene, the substituents on C2 and C3 are opposite, but adding the oxygen on the same face would lead to the substituents on the same side of the oxygen bridge, making a cis epoxide? Or maybe trans? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide formed from (E)-alkene would have the substituents on the same side (cis) because the syn addition brings the two oxygens together. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the diastereomers formed after the epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, but regardless of the starting (E) or (Z), when the epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. The diastereomers formed would depend on the configuration of the epoxide and the direction of attack during ring opening.

Wait, perhaps each reaction (Reaction 1 and Reaction 2) gives a single diol? Or maybe more than one.

Wait, let me think about Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide, then acid → diol.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide, then acid → diol.

The question is, what's the structure of these diols?

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 in the middle. So, the epoxide would be between C4 and C5. When acid is added, the epoxide ring opens, and each diol would have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons.

But the configuration of these hydroxyl groups would depend on the epoxide's configuration and the ring-opening mechanism.

Wait, during acid-catalyzed ring opening, the ring opens in a way that the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because that leads to a more stable carbocation. So, in the epoxide, the more substituted carbon would be where the attack occurs.

Wait, but in the case of oct-4-ene, both ends of the epoxide are equally substituted (each is CH2CH2). So maybe the attack can happen equally on either carbon, leading to possible diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetrical, then the ring opening would give the same product regardless of which carbon is attacked. But if the epoxide is not symmetrical, then it would lead to different products.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetrical in terms of substituents on each carbon of the double bond. So when mCPBA adds to form the epoxide, the epoxide would be a trans epoxide? Or perhaps a cis epoxide.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product of the epoxide formation. For (E)-oct-4-ene, adding mCPBA would form a specific epoxide, and for (Z)-oct-4-ene, a different one. Then, each epoxide would open under acidic conditions to form diols with specific configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to two diastereomers upon ring opening.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me approach it differently. Let's think about the possible products.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide, then acid → diol.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide, then acid → diol.

Each reaction produces a diol. But the diastereomers formed would depend on the starting material.

Wait, but when you add mCPBA to an alkene, you form an epoxide, and the configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will have a certain configuration, and for a cis (Z) alkene, another.

Then, when the epoxide is acid hydrolyzed, it forms a diol. The diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration and the way the ring opens.

Wait, so each reaction (1 and 2) gives a diol. But how many isomers are possible for each diol?

Wait, perhaps each epoxide upon acid treatment gives two diastereomers. Let me think: when the epoxide is opened, the nucleophile (water) can attack either carbon, but in an epoxide derived from (E)-oct-4-ene, perhaps the attack leads to two possible configurations.

Wait, but no, wait. For a given epoxide, the ring opening under acid conditions would lead to a specific diol. Or maybe not. Let me think of a simple example.

Take cis-2,3-dimethyloxirane (epoxide). When treated with acid, the ring opens, and the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon. So in this case, both ends are equally substituted. Wait, but in that case, the attack can happen on either carbon, leading to either R or S configuration. No, wait, in a symmetrical epoxide, the attack on either carbon would lead to the same product, because both are the same.

Wait, so if the epoxide is symmetric (like from a symmetrical starting alkene), the diol formed would be a single product because the attack on either carbon would give the same diol.

But if the epoxide is asymmetric, the attack can occur on either carbon, leading to two different diastereomers.

Wait, in Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), which are different. Let's see what their epoxide structures are.

Assuming that (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the substituents (the two CH2 groups on each end) are on opposite sides of the oxygen bridge. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the substituents are on the same side.

Wait, but in any case, the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is different from the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene.

Then, each epoxide would open under acidic conditions to form diols. Let me think about the diols formed.

For (E)-oct-4-ene's epoxide, the ring-opening would produce a diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides (trans) because the attack is from the same face, perhaps. Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps I should draw it out.

Alternatively, I can think about the products.

Wait, in the end, the problem is about how many peaks each HPLC will show. The standard HPLC is achiral; it doesn't distinguish between enantiomers. The chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers.

So, the products from each reaction are diols. Let me think about how many diastereomers and enantiomers are formed.

Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 each produce a diol. But possibly each diol has multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, let's think about each reaction. Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene, after epoxidation and ring-opening, what's the diol structure?

Assuming that the diol is a vicinal diol (two adjacent OH groups). The configuration of the diol depends on the attack during ring-opening.

Wait, for a symmetrical epoxide (like from (E)-oct-4-ene, which is symmetric), the ring-opening under acid conditions would produce a diol with two possible configurations. But wait, no, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the attack on either carbon would lead to the same product. So perhaps the diol is a single product.

But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the attack on either carbon would be the same, so the diol would have two identical OH groups on adjacent carbons, but their configuration would be the same, leading to a single product.

Wait, but maybe the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is actually not symmetric. Because (E) refers to the substituents around the double bond. Then, when the epoxide is formed, the substituents around the oxygen bridge might be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me step back.

When you have an alkene reacting with mCPBA, you form an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. Then, when that epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it forms a diol through ring-opening. The diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration and the mechanism of ring-opening.

So, for Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide, which upon acid hydrolysis gives a diol with a certain stereochemistry. For Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide, which upon acid hydrolysis gives a diol with a different stereochemistry.

Now, the question is: How many stereoisomers are formed in each reaction, and what happens when the two products are combined.

Wait, but each reaction might produce more than one stereoisomer. Alternatively, each reaction could produce a single stereoisomer.

Wait, for example, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the ring-opening would produce a single diastereomer. If the epoxide is asymmetric, perhaps it leads to two diastereomers.

But in this case, the starting alkenes are symmetric. Because oct-4-ene is symmetric around the double bond. So, if the starting alkene is symmetric, the epoxide would also be symmetric, leading to a single diol upon ring-opening.

Wait, yes, because oct-4-ene is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2, but wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the center. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2 in the middle, with CH2 groups on either side. So the molecule is symmetric. So when mCPBA adds, the epoxide would be symmetric as well, leading to a diol that is a single compound.

Wait, but wait, if the starting alkene is symmetric, then the epoxide is symmetric, so the diol formed would also be a single compound.

So, each reaction (1 and 2) would produce a single diol. So, Reaction 1 gives one diol, Reaction 2 another diol.

Now, the question is whether these two diols are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, if the diols are enantiomers, then in the achiral HPLC, they would co-elute as a single peak, but in the chiral HPLC, they would separate into two peaks. But if the diols are diastereomers, then they would separate into two peaks even in the achiral column.

Wait, but wait, the diols from (E) and (Z) would have different stereochemistry. Let me think about that.

Wait, if the starting alkenes are E and Z, and each forms a different epoxide, which upon ring-opening forms a diol with a different configuration.

So, Reaction 1 gives diol A, Reaction 2 gives diol B. Are A and B enantiomers, diastereomers, or the same?

Wait, let's think about (E) and (Z) alkenes leading to different epoxide configurations. Then, the ring-opening would produce diols with different stereochemistry.

If the diols from Reaction 1 and 2 are enantiomers, then when they are combined, the achiral HPLC would show one peak, but the chiral HPLC would show two peaks. Alternatively, if the diols are diastereomers, the achiral HPLC would show two peaks, and the chiral HPLC would show two peaks as well (since diastereomers don't interact the same way in chiral columns either).

Wait, but wait, the diols from E and Z could be diastereomers, not enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol from Reaction 1 and 2 is a pair of enantiomers. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structures.

Assuming Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide. Since the starting material is E, the epoxide will have the substituents on opposite sides. Then, upon acid treatment, the ring opens in a way that forms a diol with two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons in a trans configuration.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide, which has substituents on the same side. Acid treatment opens the ring, and the diol formed has the hydroxyl groups in a cis configuration.

Wait, no, perhaps the diols from E and Z would have different configurations. So, the diol from E is trans, and from Z is cis.

Wait, but wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let's think about the ring-opening.

If the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is such that when it opens under acid conditions, the two OH groups end up on the same face, leading to a cis diol. Similarly, the epoxide from (Z) could lead to a trans diol. Or maybe the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomers formed have different configurations, but they're not enantiomers because they're not mirror images.

Wait, but in either case, the diols from Reaction 1 and 2 would be different. So when combined, they are two different compounds, which would be diastereomers. So, in the standard (achiral) HPLC, each would have a separate peak, giving two peaks. But wait, what if the diols are enantiomers? Then, in the achiral column, they would appear as a single peak, but in the chiral column, two peaks.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to figure out the structures.

Let me consider the reaction for (E)-oct-4-ene.

(E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 with substituents opposite each other. mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn addition, forming an epoxide where the two oxygen bridges are on the same face. So, the substituents (CH2 groups) are on opposite sides relative to the epoxide oxygen.

Wait, maybe the epoxide would have the substituents on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration. So, when acid is added, the ring opens with the nucleophile attacking the more substituted carbon. But in this case, both ends are equally substituted. So, the attack can happen on either side, but since the epoxide is symmetric, it leads to a single diol.

Wait, but how does the configuration of the diol look? Let me imagine the epoxide:

O
||
C4-O-C5

But with substituents (CH2 groups) on either side. For (E), the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, so when the epoxide forms, the substituents are on opposite sides of the oxygen bridge.

Upon acid treatment, the ring opens, and the water attacks either C4 or C5. Since the epoxide is symmetric, attacking either carbon would lead to the same diol structure. So, the diol would have two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons in a trans configuration.

Wait, but in a trans diol, the OH groups are on opposite sides.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the starting substituents are on the same side. So the epoxide would have substituents on the same side. Upon ring-opening, the attack would lead to a diol with the OH groups on the same side (cis configuration).

So, Reaction 1 gives a trans diol, and Reaction 2 gives a cis diol.

Wait, but wait, no. Because ring-opening of the epoxide under acid conditions can lead to the formation of a diol where the OH groups are on the same side or opposite sides, depending on the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, but if the epoxide is trans (from E), then the ring-opening would lead to a diol where the OH groups are on the same side? Or opposite?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the transition state. In the epoxide, the substituents are on opposite sides. When the epoxide oxygen is protonated, the bond breaks, and the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon. But in this case, both ends are equally substituted, so attack can occur on either side.

Wait, but the key is that the diol formed from the trans epoxide would have the OH groups on the same face, leading to a cis diol. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, no, perhaps the attack occurs from the same face, leading to the diol's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomer count depends on the starting epoxide's configuration.

Wait, maybe each reaction produces a single diol, and the two diols are enantiomers. Because if the diol from (E) and (Z) are mirror images, then they would be enantiomers. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, but when the two diols are combined, they sum up to four stereoisomers.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible number of peaks.

If each reaction produces a single diol (i.e., a single stereoisomer), and the two diols are enantiomers, then in the achiral HPLC, they would co-elute as one peak. But in the chiral column, they would separate into two peaks. So, the combined product would have two peaks on the chiral column and one on the achiral.

But that's not one of the options. Looking at the options:

Option C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Wait, another possibility: each reaction produces two stereoisomers, leading to four in total. But that's probably not the case.

Wait, wait. Let's consider that each reaction produces two diastereomers. So, Reaction 1: two diols from (E) epoxide. Reaction 2: two diols from (Z) epoxide. Then, combining them would give four diols, leading to four peaks in the HPLC.

But that's only if each reaction produces two diastereomers. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, but when combined, if they're the same, you end up with fewer.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 4 peaks in both.

B) 2 in standard, 3 in chiral.

C) 2 in both.

D) 3 in standard, 4 in chiral.

Hmm. Let's think about the products.

If each reaction produces a single diol, and the two diols are diastereomers, then the combined product would have two diastereomers. So, in the achiral column, two peaks. In the chiral column, two peaks (since diastereomers are separated, but perhaps not, depending on their structures). Alternatively, perhaps the diols are enantiomers, so in the achiral column, one peak, and in the chiral, two peaks.

But the option C says two peaks in both. That would happen if the combined product has two diastereomers, which are separated in both columns.

Alternatively, if each reaction produces two diastereomers, and when combined, you have four diols, but perhaps some are duplicates.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to a total of four diols. So, standard HPLC would show four peaks, but chiral HPLC would separate each into two, making eight? But that's not an option.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

Each diol is a vicinal diol (two adjacent OH groups). The diol can exist as two enantiomers (if it has two chiral centers and is not meso). However, if the diol is a meso compound, it would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, so if the diol is meso, then it's a single compound, giving one peak on both columns.

But if the diol is chiral (i.e., not meso), then it would have two enantiomers. But in this case, each reaction produces one enantiomer, because the reaction is 100% complete.

Wait, perhaps Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 each produce a single enantiomer of a diol.

Wait, but that's not correct because each reaction produces a diol from a single starting material, leading to a single stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction 1 is a single enantiomer, and the diol from Reaction 2 is another enantiomer. So, when combined, you have two enantiomers. In the achiral column, they would be a single peak, but in the chiral column, two peaks.

But that would mean the standard HPLC has one peak, and the chiral has two. However, none of the options match that.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: 2 in standard, 3 in chiral.

Hmm, that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: each reaction produces two diastereomers, but in reality, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, which are new compounds. So, Reaction 1 produces diol A and diol B, Reaction 2 produces diol C and diol D. But when combined, you have four diols. Then, in the standard HPLC, four peaks. But that's option A, which is 4 peaks in both.

But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, but when combined, some are the same, leading to a total of three or two.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single diol, but each diol is a meso compound, so achiral. Then, the standard HPLC would show one peak for each diol, giving two peaks. But since both are meso, the chiral HPLC would see them as the same, but no, because if they're different diastereomers, the chiral column would separate.

Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps the products from Reaction 1 and 2 are the same diol. But that's not possible because E and Z would give different diols upon epoxidation and ring-opening.

Wait, maybe each reaction gives a diol that is a meso compound. If that's the case, each diol would be a single compound, leading to two peaks in the standard HPLC and two peaks in the chiral HPLC? Or maybe not, because a meso compound would be a single peak in both.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the possible diol structures.

Assuming Reaction 1 produces a diol where the two OH groups are on the same side (cis), and Reaction 2 produces a diol where the OHs are on opposite sides (trans). Are these diols enantiomers, diastereomers, or the same?

Wait, if the diol from Reaction 1 is cis and the one from Reaction 2 is trans, then they are diastereomers. So, in the standard HPLC, which doesn't separate enantiomers, each diastereomer would be a separate peak, leading to two peaks. In the chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, if the diols are chiral and have enantiomers, then each diastereomer might consist of a pair of enantiomers, leading to four peaks. But no, because each diol would be a single compound.

Wait, no, if each diol is a single compound, then combining them would give two diastereomers, giving two peaks in standard and two in chiral HPLC. So that would be option C: 2 peaks in both.

Wait, that seems plausible. So each reaction produces a single diol, which is a diastereomer of the other. So, when combined, two diastereomers, leading to two peaks in both HPLC columns.

But wait, if the diols are enantiomers, then in standard HPLC, they would be a single peak, but in chiral HPLC, two peaks. But that's not the case here.

So, I think the correct answer is C: 2 peaks in both.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. mCPBA reacts with alkenes to form epoxides via syn addition, and subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxides produces vicinal diols. The stereochemistry of the diols depends on the geometry of the starting alkene and the mechanism of epoxide formation and ring-opening.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction 1**: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. The (E) configuration of the starting alkene leads to a specific epoxide geometry. Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this epoxide produces a diol with a specific stereochemistry.

2. **Reaction 2**: (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form a different epoxide due to the (Z) configuration of the starting alkene. Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this epoxide produces a diol with a different stereochemistry.

3. **Products**: Each reaction produces a single diol. The diols from the two reactions are diastereomers because they have different stereochemical configurations. These diastereomers are not mirror images of each other and are therefore distinguishable in both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns.

4. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers are separated into distinct peaks. Since two diastereomeric diols are formed, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral columns can separate enantiomers, but since the diols are diastereomers, they are also separated into distinct peaks. Thus, the chiral HPLC will also show **2 peaks**.

5. **Elimination of Other Options**:
   - **Option A (4 peaks in both columns)**: Incorrect, as only two diols are formed, not four.
   - **Option B (2 peaks in standard, 3 in chiral)**: Incorrect, as there are no three distinct compounds formed.
   - **Option D (3 peaks in standard, 4 in chiral)**: Incorrect, as only two diols are formed, not four.

### Conclusion:
The chemist observes **2 peaks** in both the standard and chiral HPLC columns, as the two diols are diastereomers and are separated in both types of columns.
