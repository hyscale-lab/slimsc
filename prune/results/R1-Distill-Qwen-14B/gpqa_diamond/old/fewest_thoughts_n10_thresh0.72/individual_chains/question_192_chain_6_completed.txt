Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

So, imagine there's an uncharged spherical conductor. That's a hollow sphere, right? It has a radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity is also spherical, with radius r, and r is less than R. The center of this cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor; it's shifted a bit by s units.

Now, inside this cavity, someone placed a small positive charge +q. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. But wait, it's also given that the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Oh, and there's an angle theta between l and s.

The options are four different expressions for the electric field E. I know that for conductors, the charges redistribute in certain ways. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right! When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will induce an equal and opposite charge. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so the inner surface must develop a charge -q. But then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge +q to balance it out. Because the conductor's total charge was zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q.

But wait, no—actually, the conductor was uncharged, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q because the conductor itself must remain neutral overall. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface has -q (induced by the +q charge), and the outer surface must then have +q to make the total charge of the conductor zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0.

Wait, that's correct. So the outer surface has +q. Now, the electric field outside the conductor depends on the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Since the outer surface has +q, the electric field outside will be as if all the charge +q is concentrated at the center, right?

But wait, no. Because the conductor is a sphere, and the charges on the outer surface are free to move. But the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution, assuming it's a conductor. But in this case, the cavity is not centered. Oh, wait, the center of the cavity is offset by s from the center of the conductor. So the conductor's inner surface has an induced charge of -q, but since the cavity isn't centered, the inner charge distribution isn't uniform. Hmm, but wait, I thought that the inner surface's charge would be such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So how does that affect the outer surface?

Wait, no. In a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the presence of the charge inside the cavity (which is a different point) affects the inner surface. But the outer surface, being a conductor, can have charges induced such that the net charge outside is +q.

Wait, let me think again. The conductor was originally neutral. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) will have a charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But then, the conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q. So the outer surface has +q, and the distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere. So regardless of where the cavity is, the outer surface's charge is +q.

Wait, but wait—no. Because the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface's charge distribution isn't uniform. But the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface would still be uniformly charged because any induced charges would distribute themselves to maintain symmetry on the outer surface. So the outer surface's charge is +q, distributed uniformly. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's as if there's a charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface that includes P. The Gaussian surface would enclose the entire conductor, which has a net charge of +q on the outer surface. So, according to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q_enclosed) / r², where r is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

But wait, in the problem, point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but it's also distance l from the center of the cavity. So, what's the relation between l, L, s, and theta? The problem states that the distance from P to the cavity center is l, and the centers are separated by s. So, using the law of cosines, perhaps. Let me think:

The two centers (conductor and cavity) are separated by s. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center and l from the cavity's center. The angle between the line from P to the conductor's center and the line connecting the two centers is theta. So, using the law of cosines, we can write l² = L² + s² - 2 L s cos(theta). Wait, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, maybe l is the straight-line distance from P to the cavity's center, and the conductor's center is s away. So perhaps the line from P to the cavity's center is at an angle theta relative to the line connecting the two centers.

Wait, perhaps I should draw a diagram. Let me imagine it: the conductor's center is O, the cavity's center is O'. The displacement vector OO' has length s. Point P is somewhere outside, at a distance L from O. The displacement vector OP has length L, and the displacement vector O'P has length l. The angle between OP and OO' is theta. Hmm. So, using the law of cosines in triangle O, O', P: l^2 = L^2 + s^2 - 2 L s cos(theta). So that's the relation between l, L, s, and theta.

But wait, the problem is about the electric field at P. Outside the conductor, the field is due to the total enclosed charge, which is +q. So the field at P would be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center is L, so the electric field magnitude would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Wait, that's option B.

But looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the electric field at P depends only on the charge +q at the center of the conductor, and the distance L. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but why are the other options involving l and s? Let me think again. Suppose the point P is outside, so outside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside depends only on that +q. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is, as long as the conductor's outer surface has +q, the field outside is the same as if it were a point charge at the center. So the direction of the field would be radially outward, and the magnitude would be q/(4πε₀ L²). So option B is correct.

Wait, but what about the position of the cavity? For instance, if the cavity were off-center, would that affect the outer field? No, because the charges on the outer surface distribute themselves uniformly, regardless of the inner charge distribution. So the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge outside, which is +q, and the distance from the center. So the answer is B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor has a radius $R$ and contains a small cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$). The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the inner surface of the conductor will induce a charge $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor will then have a charge $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that includes the conductor. Here, the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge of $+q$, distributed uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. Thus, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Electric Field at Point $P$**:  
   Point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is therefore determined by the charge $+q$ at the center of the conductor and the distance $L$. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field is:

   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Involves the distance $(l - s \cos\theta)$, which is irrelevant because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.  
   - **Option B**: Correctly gives the electric field as $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which matches the derived expression.  
   - **Option C**: Involves the distance $(l + s \cos\theta)$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option D**: Suggests the electric field depends only on $l$, which is incorrect because $l$ is the distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity, not the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
