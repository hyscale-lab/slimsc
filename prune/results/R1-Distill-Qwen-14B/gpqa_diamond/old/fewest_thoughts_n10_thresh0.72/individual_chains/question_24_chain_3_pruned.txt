Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about mixtures X and Y, and a substance Z. I'll start by reading the problem carefully and noting down all the key points.

So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine water usually means the mixture has something that can react with bromine, like unsaturated bonds. Like alkenes or alkynes. Oh wait, but the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So maybe each component has a single double bond or something else that's not conjugated.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction. The result is mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids. And Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y doesn't have any double bonds that can react with bromine. That suggests that the components of Y are more saturated—maybe alkanes, or perhaps they have single bonds only.

Next, hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions using platinum gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's already fully saturated—so it's an alkane.

So, Z is an alkane. Let's figure out the molecular formula of Z. The hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%. Let me think: the percentage by mass is (mass of H)/(molar mass) * 100 = 14.28.

Assuming Z is CnH2n+2? Wait, or maybe not. Let's see. Let's compute it.

Hydrogen's molar mass is 1, carbon is 12.

Let’s denote the molecular formula as CnHm. Since it's an alkane, m = 2n + 2. But let's confirm.

Wait, Z is the result of hydrogenation of both X and Y. So, if X and Y after hydrogenation give Z, which is an alkane. So both X and Y must have compounds that can be hydrogenated to the same alkane Z.

So, for example, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, they might hydrogenate to the same alkane. Alternatively, perhaps they have different structures but same hydrogenation product. Wait, but the problem says that after hydrogenation of both X and Y, only Z is formed. So, X and Y must hydrogenate to Z, which is an alkane.

Wait, but X has two liquids that decolorize bromine, meaning they have double bonds. So when hydrogenated, they become alkanes. Similarly, Y doesn't react with bromine, so perhaps Y's components are alkanes or something else that doesn't have double bonds. But if Y's components are alkanes, then hydrogenation wouldn't change them. But the problem says that the hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So, Y must contain something that can react with H2 under severe conditions, perhaps something else besides alkanes. Hmm.

Wait, but Y is formed
