Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Wait, okay. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. So, it's about a weak acid (acetic acid) being titrated with a strong base (NaOH). The pH at certain points in the titration curve is required.

First, I should probably find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So initial volume is 20 cm³, initial concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2.

Calculating that: M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, what's the equivalence point volume? Equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH needed: same as moles of acetic acid, because it's a 1:1 reaction (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O). So moles NaOH = 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: moles / concentration. So 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, wait. The equivalence is 10 cm³, so 25% would be 2.5 cm³. But wait, sometimes the percentage is based on the amount of acid. Oh, no, I think the question says 25% titration, meaning 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So first, let's calculate the pH at 25% titration point. Then, the equivalence point pH.

At 25% titration:

We've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. So after adding NaOH, some of it has been neutralized. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+
