Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. And there are four options provided with different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the meson's lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the further it can travel before decaying. But wait, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. Oh right, the uncertainty principle: Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime τ. So, τ is proportional to ħ/(Γ), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Oh, right, the formula for the mean decay length is L = βγcτ, where β is v/c, γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, since X is a meson, which is a boson, but I think the formula is similar to how we calculate for particles like pions or muons.

Wait, let me get the steps straight:

1. First, calculate the lifetime τ of the meson using the width Γ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units are important here. I need to make sure all units are compatible.

2. Then, find the speed v of the meson. Since it's produced with energy E_X, which is much larger than its rest mass (E_X=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, so E_X is about
