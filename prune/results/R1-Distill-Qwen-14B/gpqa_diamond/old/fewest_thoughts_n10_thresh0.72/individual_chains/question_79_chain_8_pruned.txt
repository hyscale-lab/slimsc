Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and we need to identify the original compound X from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Wait, no, wait. Sharpless epoxidation uses a different setup. Oh right, wait, Sharpless is for epoxidizing epoxides from diols or something. Alternatively, maybe it's used in other reactions, like the Prilezhaev oxidation? Or perhaps it's involved in acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bicyclic amine, which I think is known as diazabicyclooctane or DBO. It's often used as a base in certain reactions, like in the Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement. Oh, or maybe it's a catalyst in some reactions. Alternatively, I'm pretty sure that DBO is used in the epoxidation of alkenes, specifically in the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Prilezhaev epoxidation uses a peracid and DBO as a catalyst, right?

Wait, but the reaction conditions here are a nonpolar solvent at 403 K (which is around 130Â°C) for a day. So maybe the reaction is an epoxidation of an alkene. Because compound X has the formula C11H12O. Let me check: the molecular formula is C11H12O. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C11H12O, the formula is CnHmO
