Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

So the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, and we're supposed to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D.

Wait, first I need to remember what the pp-III branch is. From what I recall, the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. I think the pp-III branch involves reactions where a carbon-13 nucleus captures a proton to form nitrogen-14, which then emits a positron and a neutrino to become carbon-13 again. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, the pp-III branch might involve the production of boron via some reactions, but I'm a bit hazy. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos through the process where a C-13 captures a proton to become N-14, which then undergoes beta decay, emitting a positron and a neutrino. These are called CNO cycle neutrinos because they come from the CNO (Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen) cycle, I think. Oh wait no, the CNO cycle is a separate process. Wait, the pp chain mainly produces neutrinos
