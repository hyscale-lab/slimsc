Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is used in semiconductor devices, specifically when the current is in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. 

Wait, the equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V² / L³). Right, I think this equation comes from the theory where the current is limited by the space charge itself, not by other factors like ohmic resistance or contact barriers.

So the question is about the true statement regarding the validity of this equation. The options are A to D.

Let me think about each option. 

Option A: The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Hmm, Ohmic contact would imply that the contact doesn't cause any barriers for the carriers. But wait, in the SCLC region, the current is limited by the space charge, which builds up near the cathode. Ohmic contacts are good because they don't impede the current, but I'm not sure about the drift current part. Drift current is due to electric fields, but in space-charge-limited conditions, I think the electric field is strong, so drift would be significant. Or maybe the equation assumes negligible drift compared to something else? Not sure yet.

Option B: It's valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier would mean the device allows carriers to flow without much hindrance. Negligible diffusion current—that makes sense because in SCLC, the current is mainly due to the electric field (drift) and not due to concentration gradients (diffusion). So if diffusion current is negligible, that fits. Oh wait, but the equation is for space-charge-limited current, so the carriers are being depleted, leading to a space charge that affects the electric field. So if the contacts are good (no injection barriers), that would align with the assumptions. But wait, the equation assumes that the carriers are supplied without much barrier, which would be the case if there's no injection barrier. So B looks possible.

Option C: Valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contacts have barriers, which would affect the current. So if there's a Schottky contact, that introduces a barrier, which might mean that the Mott-Gurney equation doesn't apply because it's assuming no such barriers. Because in the SCLC region, the current is limited by the space charge; but if there's a Schottky barrier, the actual current might be limited by the barrier's height, not the space charge. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Valid for a two-carrier
