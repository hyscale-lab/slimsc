Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li with 3 neutrons would be Li-6 because lithium has 3 protons and adding 3 neutrons makes it 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider is given by the relativistic energy formula. Oh wait, when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their energy isn't just kinetic. The total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, right? But wait, in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I need to clarify that.

Wait, when they say the energy of the RHIC, I think they mean the total energy each beam has. Because RHIC collides heavy ions, so each ion is accelerated to a certain energy. So the formula for the total energy (gamma * m c²) is what I should use here.

So the first step is to find the relativistic gamma factor for v = 0.96c. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me calculate more precisely. 0.96 squared is exactly 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

Now I need the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is approximately 938 MeV/c². So for a nucleus with A=6, the rest mass energy is 6 * 938 MeV. Wait, wait a second. Wait, the mass of a nucleus isn't exactly A times the mass of a nucleon because of binding energy. Oh, but in particle physics, when dealing with high energies, they often approximate the mass as A * m_nucleon. So for the purpose of this problem, I think it's acceptable to use m = 6 * 938 MeV/c².

Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Oh wait, wait, 938 MeV is about 0.938 GeV. So 6 * 0.938 GeV = 5.628 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.628 GeV. Therefore, the total energy is gamma * m c². So gamma is approximately 3.5714, and m c²
