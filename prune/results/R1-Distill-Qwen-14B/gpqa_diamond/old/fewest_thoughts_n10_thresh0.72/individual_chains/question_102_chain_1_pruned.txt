Okay, so I've got this question about a ligand-receptor pair and their expression in some kind of mouse model. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

So the setup is that they've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one vector, right? So the ligand and the receptor are each under their own promoters, but in the same construct. Wait, no, wait. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. Oh, I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so that the second gene can be translated without a second promoter. So the vector has the ligand first, then the receptor after an IRES. So when the vector is expressed, it's a single mRNA that produces both proteins.

The vector structure: 5' LoxP-stop-loxP cassette followed by the ligand ORF, which is fused to mCherry. Then the IRES, then the receptor ORF fused to eGFP, followed by another stop cassette with lox2272. So the idea is that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing expression of the ligand and receptor.

Wait, LoxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. The lox-P stop lox-P cassette would be a region where the stop codon is flanked by loxP sites. So when Cre is introduced, it would recombine and remove the stop codon, allowing the ligand to be expressed along with mCherry. Similarly for the other cassette.

But in the question, they used this vector in primary astrocyte culture and did a Western blot. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So they probably want to see if the ligand and receptor are being expressed. But then they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So, SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression in neural crest cells, I think. So the Cre would activate the construct in those cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They expected to see a green signal, which comes from eGFP. But they don't. So why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, not autocrine. But in the context of expression, if both are expressed in the same cells, they could be autocrine. But the question is about why eGFP isn't showing up. I'm not sure how paracrine would affect the expression in the construct, though.

Option B: receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it should be processed through the ER and Golgi. If it's stuck, maybe the eGFP would accumulate in the Golgi. But I don't see why that would prevent expression.
