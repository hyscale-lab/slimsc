Okay, so I have this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. The charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t, where t is after the time tr when the charge was at some position. So the potentials are retarded, right?

I remember that the scalar potential V and vector potential A are related to the electric and magnetic fields via Maxwell's equations. For a point charge, the scalar potential usually looks similar to Coulomb's law but might involve some time delays or other factors because the charge is moving.

Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge—does it still depend on r, the distance from the charge to the observation point? Or does it involve the position at the retarded time? Oh, right, the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d)], where d is the distance from the charge at the retarded time to the observation point. But wait, wait, because when the charge is moving, the distance might not just be r. Or is it the same as the static case because the scalar potential is just based on the charge's position at the retarded time?

Wait, no. The retarded time tr is the time when the charge's position is such that the light (or the electromagnetic wave) emitted then reaches the observer at time t. So the distance d would be |r - s(tr)|, but since s(tr) is the position at time tr, and r is the observation point, I think d = |r - s(tr)|. But in the options, the scalar potentials are given as functions of r or d. Looking at the options, option C and D have d in the denominator.

In the static case, when the charge isn't moving, the scalar potential is q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, the scalar potential is still based on the charge's position at the retarded time, but the distance would be d, not r. So the expression might have d in it. So option C and D have d terms.

Wait, but in the options, for example, option C is V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (d
