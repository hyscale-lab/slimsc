Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) it can achieve in an hour. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, what do I know about ESPRESSO? I remember it's a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets, I think, which means it has high spectral resolution. High resolution implies it can separate light into many wavelengths, but maybe that also affects the S/N because each pixel might get less photons.

Wait, the question is about detectability based on S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel after an hour. So, I need to figure out for each star whether the S/N meets this threshold.

The stars given are a) Canopus, b) Polaris, and four more with specific magnitudes and distances. Let me list the options a to f and then the choices A to D.

So, how does the S/N depend on these factors? I think the S/N for a star observed with a spectrograph depends on several factors: the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the efficiency of the instrument, the sky background, and the spectral resolution which affects how many photons are in each pixel.

Wait, I think the formula for S/N is roughly proportional to sqrt(N), where N is the number of photons collected. Or wait, the S/N per pixel increases with the square root of the exposure time and the number of photons per pixel. 

But I'm more familiar with S/N scaling with the square root of the exposure time. So, for a longer exposure, the S/N improves. Since the exposure here is fixed at 1 hour, that's a given.

The key factors are the star's brightness (apparent magnitude) and the distance (which affects how bright it appears to us).

Wait, no, the apparent magnitude depends on the distance and the absolute magnitude. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. So for each of the stars c, d, e, f, their M is 15 mag
