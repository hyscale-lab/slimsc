Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start from the beginning.

The first part of the question is about heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, right? So each Br is on adjacent carbons, so eliminating two HBr would form a double bond between those carbons. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide but not vicinal. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. No, 1,3-dibromo implies that the two Br atoms are on carbons 1 and 3. So they're not adjacent. Oh wait, no, adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to two others in a diamond lattice. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on adamantane's structure. Let me think: adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each carbon has three bonds, but in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons that are not adjacent. Hmm, wait, so if that's the case, then heating with KOH wouldn't eliminate to form a double bond because the Br atoms are not adjacent. Wait, but in the product, the IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, another possibility: when dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, especially when the dihalide is symmetrical or when the base is in excess, they can undergo a substitution reaction. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—each Br is on a bridgehead. In such a case, perhaps the base abstracts a β hydrogen, leading to a substitution reaction. But again, substitution would typically give a monoalkoxide, but perhaps in this case, with two Br atoms, both could
