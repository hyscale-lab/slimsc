Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and jot down what I know.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when we observe the star's brightness over time (like when it rotates), we'll see variations because the spots come into and out of view. The interesting part is that these brightness changes can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that produces the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star, assuming there were no spots.

So, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32. I need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, I remember that the brightness variation due to a planet transiting a star (like the transit method) is calculated using the formula:

ΔF = (Rpl / Rstar)^2

Because the planet blocks a fraction of the star's light equal to the square of the ratio of their radii. But wait, this is when the planet passes directly in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. So the amplitude of the dip depends on the area blocked.

In the case of the star with spots, when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view. The spots are darker, so when they're facing us, the total brightness decreases. But since the star is rotating, the spots go in and out of view, causing a periodic dip in brightness. The question is about the amplitude of this dip being similar to that caused by a transiting planet.

So, the idea is to calculate the equivalent change in brightness caused by the spots and set that equal to the change caused by a planet, then solve for the planet radius.

Wait, but the spots are cooler. How does that affect the brightness? Oh, right, the spots are darker, so when they are on the visible hemisphere, the total light we receive decreases compared to when the spots are not visible. So the observed flux will dip when the spots are facing us.

First, I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness due to the spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, the total area covered is 20% of the hemisphere. But wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so the area of a hemisphere is 2πR². Wait no, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So a hemisphere is 2πR². But the filling factor is 20% of that.

Wait, the problem says the hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But the star's total surface area is 4π R
