Okay, so I've got this problem here about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the observed brightness. I need to figure out what the radius of a planet would be to cause the same brightness variation. Hmm, let's break it down.

Alright, the star has the same radius as the Sun, so R_star is about 1 solar radius. The effective temperature is 6000K, which I remember is a bit cooler than the Sun, which is around 5778K. But I'm not sure if that matters here.

The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere. The filling factor is 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots, right? So 20% of one hemisphere is covered. But wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots. Oh wait, no, the filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the entire star's surface is covered? Or just that hemisphere? Hmm, wait looking at the question again: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. Oh okay, so each hemisphere's total area is (4πR²)/2, since the whole star is 4πR². So each hemisphere is 2πR². So the spots cover 20% of that, which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total area covered by spots is 0.4πR². 

Each spot is cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. The star's Teff is 6000K, so the spots are 5000K? Because 6000 - 1000=5000. Or wait, it says a temperature difference of 1000K, but it's not clear which way. Oh, the spots are cooler, so their temperature is 5000K.

The star's brightness is modulated as it rotates because the spots come into and out of view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, more spots are visible, and the brightness dips. When the other side (with no spots) is facing, brightness is higher. So the variation in brightness is due to the spots blocking
