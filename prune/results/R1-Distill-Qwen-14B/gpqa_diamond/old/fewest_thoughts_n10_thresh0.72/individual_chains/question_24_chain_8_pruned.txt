Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, alright, let's read the question carefully.

So, the problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it forms another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids via a disproportionation reaction. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. 

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%, and it's part of mixture Y. Z is used widely as a solvent and doesn't react further with hydrogen. Also, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Alright, let me break this down. First, the initial mixture X is a pair of liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually means they have unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, which react with Br2. Since it's a mixture of two liquids, perhaps they are different compounds that each have such properties.

Next, when X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. Disproportionation is when a single element in a compound undergoes both oxidation and reduction. So, one component of X might be getting oxidized and another reduced, or maybe one component of X is undergoing disproportionation itself, producing two different substances.

Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, implying that whatever was unsaturated in X has been transformed into something saturated in Y. So, perhaps the original compounds in X are alkenes or alkynes, and after reaction, they become alkanes or possibly other saturated compounds.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y yields the same hydrocarbon Z. Hydrogenation generally adds hydrogen across double bonds, turning alkenes into alkanes. But in this case, hydrogenation of both mixtures leads to a single product, which suggests that Z must be a saturated compound, perhaps an alkane, as they don't react further with hydrogen.

Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let me calculate what that implies. The mass fraction is the percentage by mass of hydrogen in Z. Let's say the molecular formula of Z is CnHm. The percentage of H is (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28%. Let me solve for possible n and m.

Let me rearrange the equation:

(m) / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Bring all m terms to left:

m - 0.1428m = 0.1428 *12n

0.8572 m = 1.7136 n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) * n ≈ 2 * n

So approximately, m is about twice n. Let's test some possibilities.

Wait, 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2. So m ≈ 2n.

So the formula is probably CnH2n. But wait, that would be a molecule like an alkene (CnH2n) or maybe an aromatic compound, but wait Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's an alkane? No, because alkenes would hydrogenate into alkanes. Wait, no, Z is obtained after hydrogenation, so perhaps Z is an alkane.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. Z is formed when X and Y are hydrogenated. So, X has some unsaturated compounds, which upon hydrogenation become alkanes. Y, being the result of a disproportionation, perhaps has some other structures. But both
