Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, twice as excited—does that mean the population of the excited state is higher in star_1? Oh right, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. 

So the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n_upper and n_lower) is equal to (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = E_upper - E_lower. Since star_1 has twice as many in the specific energy level as star_2, maybe the ratio is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2? Or wait, no, the ratio between star_1 and star_2 is 2:1. Let me think.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So, for the same transition, the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Because, for each star, the ratio depends on their respective temperatures.

So let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower) = 2 R2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Assuming that g_upper/g_lower is the same for both stars, since it's a property of the atom and doesn't change between stars, the ratio R1/R2 would be exp( -(ΔE)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(ΔE)/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me correct that. Because R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

But according to the problem, R1 = 2 R2. So R1/R2 = 2. 

So substituting, 2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Taking natural log on both sides: ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [
