Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into view periodically, causing brightness variations that can mimic an exoplanet's transit. The question is asking, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet, what radius would produce the same brightness variation amplitude?

Hmm. So, the key here is to find the ratio R_pl / R_star, where R_pl is the planet's radius and R_star is the star's radius. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The amount blocked (the dip in brightness) depends on the size of the planet relative to the star.

Wait, the problem says that the star has spots, and this creates a similar brightness variation as a planet would. So we need to model both scenarios.

First, let me think about the exoplanet transit scenario. The depth of the transit (delta F) is proportional to (R_pl / R_star)^2. Because area scales with the square of radius. So if the planet is smaller, the dip is smaller.

Now, the case with the star spots. The star isn't uniformly bright. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, they contribute less to the total brightness. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to vary.

But the question says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the variation in brightness due to the spots is similar to that caused by a planet. So we need to find the planet's radius that would cause the same change in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, but how does the spot coverage affect the brightness? Let me think.

The star's total brightness without spots is L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But with spots, part of the surface emits less. The filling factor is 20%, so spots cover 0.2 of the surface area.

Each spot has a temperature 1000K less than the star. So the effective temperature of the spots is 5000K? Wait, wait no. The star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000K.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if the spots contribute less flux because they're cooler. So the total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the flux from the spotted regions.

The star's total flux without spots is F_total = σTeff^4. The flux from the spots is σ*(T_spot)^4 multiplied by the area of spots, and the flux from the rest is σ*Teff^4 multiplied by the rest area.

Wait, no, the star's flux is usually calculated as the average over the surface. The filling factor f is
