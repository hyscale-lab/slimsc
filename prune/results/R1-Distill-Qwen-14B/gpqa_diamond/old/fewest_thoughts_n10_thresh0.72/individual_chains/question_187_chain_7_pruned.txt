Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, part of the European Southern Observatory's instruments. The question gives me six stars and asks how many are detectable based on a specific S/N ratio.

The key here is understanding what the S/N ratio depends on. From what I recall, the signal-to-noise ratio in spectroscopy is influenced by factors like the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the noise sources like background radiation and detector readout.

The question states that a star is detectable if it gives an S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of these stars have an apparent brightness (V magnitude) that would allow ESPRESSO to achieve this S/N.

First, I should probably find out the typical S/N ESPRESSO can achieve for a given star's magnitude. I think ESPRESSO has a certain sensitivity curve. Wait, I remember that ESPRESSO's design allows it to reach high S/N ratios for bright stars. Let me think about the parameters.

The V magnitude is given for each star, but wait, no, the problem says each star has an absolute V magnitude of 15. Oh, wait, no, looking again: options a) and b) are Canopus and Polaris, which have known absolute magnitudes, I think. The others have absolute magnitude 15, but different distances. Oh, right, absolute magnitude is the brightness at 10 parsecs. So their apparent magnitudes would depend on their actual distances.

So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star, and then determine if ESPRESSO can reach S/N >=10 in 1 hour for that apparent magnitude.

I should first figure out the formula for apparent magnitude. The formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. Because the formula is m - M = 5 log10(d/10), so m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5 +
