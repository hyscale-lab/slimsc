Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's probably a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows ester groups are present. Ester groups have specific absorption bands, usually a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound has at least an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals:
1. Two signals for aromatic H. That suggests the substituents on the benzene are in positions that cause two distinct aromatic proton environments. For example, if the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would all be equivalent, but if they're ortho or meta, there might be different environments. Wait, if it's di-substituted, and only two aromatic signals, maybe the substituents are in positions that make the remaining protons split into two groups. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, like a methyl group. Hmm.

2. Two signals for vinyl H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, so maybe there's a substituent with a double bond, like an ester group. Wait, esters typically have an R-O-CO-O-R structure, but wait no, esters are RCOOR'. So maybe there's a vinyl group attached. For instance, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that includes a vinyl group, like an allyl ester or something.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So each of these is a singlet, probably, since they're each a set of equivalent methyl groups. But wait, the question says two signals, so maybe two different methyl groups. For example, one methyl attached to something deshielded and another in a different environment.

Also, there are no signals for –CH2 groups. So no methylene groups are present. That suggests that any substituents are either CH3 or attached in a way that CH2 groups are
