Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about particle decay and the resolution needed in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, wait. I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer from the perspective of an observer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation from special relativity. Oh right, the gamma factor comes into play here.

So the lifetime observed (τ) is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is given by E divided by m c². Oh wait, but E here is the total energy of the particle, right? Because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But wait, the units here are in GeV and GeV/c². Oh, the mass is given in GeV, but I need to be careful with units.

Wait, the energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that: 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately, let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41*8=27.28. So 27 is close to 3.41*8, so 8 is approximately gamma. So gamma is roughly 8.

So the observed lifetime is τ = gamma * τ₀. That would be 8 * 8e-16 sec = 6.4e-15 seconds. Wait, 8 * 8 is 64, so 64e-16 seconds is 6.4e-15 s? Wait, no, wait: 8 times 8e-16 is 64e-16, which is 6.4e-15 seconds, yeah.

Now, knowing that the particles move during their lifetime, the distance they travel before decaying is v multiplied by τ. The question is about the resolution required to observe the decay, which probably refers to the minimum distance that can be detected. Or perhaps the minimum distance the particles travel such that they can be distinguished.

Wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So maybe the idea is that the particles have a certain average path length, and the resolution (the smallest distance the detector can distinguish) must be such that a certain fraction of the decays happen within that resolution.

Wait, but I think the key here is about the decay length. The decay length L is given by c * τ, because the particle is moving at speed v ≈ c (since it's a high-energy particle, so v ≈ c). So L = c * τ.

Wait, but wait, no. The particle's speed is v = beta c. So the lifetime from the lab frame is gamma tau_0, and the distance is v tau = beta c gamma tau_0. But gamma is E/(m c²), so beta can be found from gamma and the mass. Hmm, but wait for high-energy particles, beta is approximately 1, right? Because gamma is large, so beta is close to 1. So for our purposes, perhaps we can approximate v as c.

So the average decay length L is c * gamma tau_0. Let me compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So L = c * gamma tau_0 = 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that: 3e8 * 8e-16 = 24e-8 m, which is 2.4e-7 meters, which is 2.4e-7 m or 0.24 micrometers? Hmm.

Wait, but this is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. To observe the decay, the detector's resolution needs to be sufficient to see the track. The minimum resolution required would relate to the minimum distance that the decay products are from the point of production. Or perhaps the question is about the minimum detection length such that at least 30% of the decays are within that length, thereby making them observable.

So, perhaps we should model this using the decay probability. The probability that a particle decays within a certain distance x is given by 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)). Wait, no, wait. Because the decay length is L = c tau. So the probability that the particle decays before traveling a distance x is P = 1 - exp(-x / L).

Wait, if x is the distance, then the probability is 1 - exp( -x/(c tau) ). Because the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0, so the decay probability is 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)).

Wait, no, let me think about it again. The decay probability as a function of time is 1 - exp(-t/(tau)). But since t = x / c, because x = v t, and v ≈ c, so x = c t. So substituting, the probability is P = 1 - exp( -x/(c tau) ).

We want the probability P to be at least 30%, so 0.3. So:

0.3 = 1 - exp( -x/(c tau) )

So exp( -x/(c tau) ) = 0.7.

Take natural log on both sides: -x/(c tau) = ln(0.7)

So x = - c tau ln(0.7)

Compute that.

We know that ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667. So x = c tau * 0.35667.

Wait, no, wait: since ln(0.7) is negative, so -x/(c tau) is ln(0.7), which is negative. So,

x/(c tau) = - ln(0.7) ≈ 0.35667.

So,

x = c tau * 0.35667.

So, I need to compute x, the minimum distance where 30% of the decays have happened.

But wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution is the minimum x such that P >= 0.3. So the resolution is x, so that 30% of the decays are within x. So the required x would be the one where P=0.3.

Let me compute the numbers.

We have:

c = 3e8 m/s.

Tau is gamma tau_0. Gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.916, approximately 8.

Wait, but wait, the units: E = 27 GeV, m c² is m in GeV/c² times c². Wait, but when E is given in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so the energy is E = gamma m c². Therefore, gamma = E/(m c²) in natural units where c=1 and so on, but when working in SI units, perhaps I have to take care, but I think that for the purposes of gamma, since both E and m are in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps gamma is simply E/m. Because E [GeV] = gamma m [GeV/c²] c^2 [ (m/s)^2 ].

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: E (in GeV) = gamma * m * c^2. So gamma is E/(m c²). So because E and m are given in units of GeV, and m is in GeV/c², let me compute gamma.

Wait, let's compute gamma as E divided by (m c²). E is 27 GeV. m is 3.41 GeV/c². So, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918, which is approximately 8.

So gamma is approximately 8.

Tau is gamma tau_0, so 8 * 8e-16 s = 6.4e-15 s.

So c tau is 3e8 m/s * 6.4e-15 s = 1.92e-6 meters.

So, c tau is approximately 1.92e-6 meters.

Now, x is equal to c tau multiplied by 0.35667 (because x = c tau * 0.35667).

So x ≈ 1.92e-6 m * 0.35667 ≈ 6.86e-7 meters.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 0.35667 multiplied by 1.92e-6.

Compute 1.92e-6 * 0.35667:

Let me compute 1.92 * 0.35667.

Approximately: 1.92 * 0.35 = 0.672, 1.92 * 0.00667 ≈ 0.0128. So total approx 0.6848.

So x ≈ 0.6848e-6 meters, which is 6.848e-7 meters or about 6.85e-7 m.

Looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. Hmm. Wait, the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m

Wait, none of the options are close to 6.8e-7 m. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate. Let me go step by step again.

Wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

So the process is:

1. Calculate gamma: gamma = E/(m c²). E is 27 GeV; m is 3.41 GeV/c². So gamma = 27 / 3.41 = approximately 7.918.

2. Calculate tau = gamma * tau_0 = 7.918 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.334e-15 s.

3. The average path length is L = c tau = 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s = 1.9002e-6 meters, approximately 1.9e-6 m.

Wait, but earlier I had 1.92e-6 m. Close enough.

So, the average path length is about 1.9e-6 m. Now, the question is about the minimum resolution (x) such that 30% of the decays are observed. So, the number of decays observed is proportional to the probability that the decay occurs within x. The probability P is 1 - exp(-x/L), as I thought before.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Maybe the question is asking for the minimum resolution (like the detector's spatial resolution) such that you can distinguish the decay point from the interaction point. So, the decay must occur within a distance such that the tracks can be detected. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimum path length that 30% of the particles have decayed beyond that point, so the detector would need to have a resolution good enough to measure that.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the decay length formula and the probability.

As P = 1 - exp(-x/L). We want P >= 0.3.

So, solving for x, 0.3 = 1 - exp(-x/L) → exp(-x/L) = 0.7 → -x/L = ln(0.7) → x = -L ln(0.7).

Wait, that's correct. So ln(0.7) is approx -0.35667, so x = 0.35667 * L.

So, x = 0.35667 * 1.9e-6 m = approximately 6.8e-7 m.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A which is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm. But wait, 6.8e-7 is about 6.8e-7 m, which is 0.68e-6 m. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 3 times larger than that. Hmm. So that's not matching.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the gamma calculation? Let me double-check.

Gamma is E/(m c²). Since E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c². So, gamma = 27 / 3.41 = approximately 7.918. That's correct.

Tau = gamma * tau_0 → 7.918 * 8e-16 s = 6.334e-15 s.

c tau = 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s = 1.9002e-6 m. So that's correct.

So, x = 0.35667 * 1.9002e-6 m = approx 6.8e-7 m.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in choosing the formula for the probability. Let me think again.

The decay probability is P = 1 - exp( -x/(c tau) ). And since tau = gamma tau_0, c tau is the same as the average decay length L.

Wait, perhaps I should compute c tau again, considering that gamma is 7.918, not 8. Let me recalculate.

Gamma is 7.918 → tau = 7.918 * 8e-16 = 6.3344e-15 s.

c tau = 3e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s = 1.90032e-6 m.

So, x = 0.35667 * 1.90032e-6 m ≈ 6.8e-7 m.

Hmm. So none of the options match. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh! That's a possibility. Because sometimes, in particle physics, E can refer to kinetic energy. If E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be E_kinetic + m c². So, if X⁰ has a kinetic energy of 27 GeV, then its total energy E is 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 GeV. That would change gamma.

Ah, this is a crucial point. So if E given is the kinetic energy, then total energy is E_total = m c² + K.E. So, E_total = 3.41 GeV + 27 GeV = 30.41 GeV.

Then gamma would be 30.41 / 3.41 = approx 8.9, maybe.

Wait, 30.41 divided by 3.41 is 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.9, yes.

So, gamma is about 8.9 instead of 7.918.

Then, tau = gamma tau_0 = 8.9 * 8e-16 s = 7.12e-15 s.

c tau = 3e8 m/s * 7.12e-15 s = 2.136e-6 m ≈ 2.14e-6 m.

Then, x = 0.35667 * 2.14e-6 m ≈ 0.763e-6 m, which is 7.63e-7 m.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should compute gamma without considering that. Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the energy is the total energy, so E = gamma m c², so gamma is E/m.

Wait, but the initial calculation was correct in that scenario. So let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity beta, and then use beta gamma tau_0 c.

Wait, maybe that's where I went wrong. Because the average decay length is L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Ah! Oh wait, that's right. Because tau is gamma tau_0, and the particle's speed is beta c. So the decay length is L = beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

So, perhaps I neglected the beta factor. Because gamma = E/(m c²), but beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, let me recast.

Gamma is E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918. So,

Gamma = 7.918 → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.918)^2 )).

Compute 7.918 squared: approx 62.7. So 1/62.7 ≈ 0.01596.

So 1 - 0.01596 ≈ 0.98404. sqrt of that is approx 0.992.

So beta ≈ 0.992.

So, the decay length L = beta c gamma tau_0.

So L = beta * c * gamma * tau_0.

Therefore, gamma is 7.918, so:

L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 7.918 * 8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, compute c * gamma tau_0:

c = 3e8 m/s.

gamma tau_0 = 7.918 * 8e-16 = 6.334e-15 s.

So c * gamma tau_0 = 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s = 1.9002e-6 m.

Then multiply by beta (0.992): 1.9002e-6 m * 0.992 ≈ 1.885e-6 m.

So, L ≈ 1.885e-6 m.

Wait, so then x is 0.35667 * L = 0.35667 * 1.885e-6 m ≈ 6.72e-7 m. Still about 6.7e-7 m.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximations.

Let me compute gamma more accurately: 27 / 3.41 = exactly, let's compute it.

3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 7.9 = 27. (3.41 * 7 =23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069 → 23.87+3.069=26.939. So 3.41 *7.9=26.939. 27 is 0.061 more. 0.061 /3.41 ≈0.0179. So gamma is approximately 7.9179 → 7.9179.

So, gamma is 7.9179.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). So 1/gamma^2 is 1/(7.9179)^2 ≈ 1/62.7 ≈ 0.01597.

So 1 - 0.01597 = 0.98403. Sqrt of that is sqrt(0.98403) ≈ 0.9920.

So beta ≈ 0.992.

So, L = beta * c * gamma tau_0.

But wait, tau = gamma tau_0, so L = beta c tau.

Yes, that's correct.

So, L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s.

Compute 3e8 * 6.334e-15 = 1.9002e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.992: 1.9002e-6 *0.992 ≈ 1.885e-6 m.

So, L ≈ 1.885e-6 m.

Then x = 0.35667 * 1.885e-6 = approx 6.713e-7 m.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm using the average decay length, but the question is about the minimum distance such that 30% of decays are within that distance. So perhaps I should think about the minimum x where P=0.3.

Wait, perhaps I should find x such that the probability of decaying within x is 30%. So P=0.3 = 1 - exp(-x/L), so x = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

ln(1/0.7) = ln(1.42857) ≈ 0.35667.

So x = L * 0.35667.

As above, that gives x ≈ 0.35667 * 1.885e-6 m ≈ 6.71e-7 m.

Which is approximately 6.7e-7 m. But the options don't have this.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

B) 2.08e-9 m → 2.08 nanometers.

C) 2.08e-1 m → 20.8 cm.

D) 2.08e-3 m → 2.08 mm.

Hmm. None of these match 6.7e-7 m, which is 0.67 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the decay length. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the average decay length but about the minimum distance that the decay products travel.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimum x such that 30% of the decay products are within x. So, as before, x = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)).

But perhaps I should compute this using the exact numbers.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute gamma exactly:

Gamma = 27 / 3.41 → Let's do the division.

3.41 × 7 = 23.87 → 27 -23.87 = 3.13.

3.41 × 0.9 = 3.069 → 3.13 -3.069 = 0.061.

Now, 0.061 ÷ 3.41 = approximately 0.0179.

So, gamma = 7.9 + 0.0179 ≈ 7.9179.

So, gamma = 7.9179.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (7.9179)^2 ≈ let's compute:

7.9^2 = 62.41. 0.0179^2 is negligible. So, 7.9179^2 ≈ 62.7.

So, 1/gamma^2 ≈ 0.01597.

1 - 0.01597 =0.98403.

sqrt(0.98403) ≈ 0.9920.

So, beta is approximately 0.992.

So, L = beta * c * tau.

Tau is gamma * tau_0 = 7.9179 * 8e-16 s = 6.3343e-15 s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So, c * tau = 3e8 * 6.3343e-15 = 1.90029e-6 m.

Multiply by beta: 1.90029e-6 * 0.9920 ≈ 1.885e-6 m.

So, L ≈ 1.885e-6 m.

x = 0.35667 * L = 0.35667 * 1.885e-6 = Let's compute that:

1.885e-6 * 0.35667 ≈ 6.71e-7 m.

Hmm, so 6.71e-7 meters is 671 nm, which is 0.671 micrometers.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is looking for the minimum resolution as the maximum distance between the decay products or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the resolution refers to the minimum detectable distance, meaning that only a fraction of the decays can be observed. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum resolution required such that the decay can be observed. So, if the decay length is L, the minimum resolution must be less than L to detect any decays. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum distance (x) such that the probability of decay within x is 30%, so x is the required resolution.

Another approach: perhaps the resolution is the minimal detectable length, and the probability of detecting a decay is the fraction that decay within that length.

Ah, but I've done that already. So, unless I made a miscalculation, perhaps the answer is not among the options. But that can't be the case. So perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of c * tau. Let me recheck.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 6.334e-15 s.

So, 3e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s = 3e8 * 6.334e-15 = 3 *6.334e-7 = 1.9002e-6 m. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity as (gamma m v) rather than beta c. No, that's not right.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy given is the rest mass, but that can't be, because the rest mass is 3.41 GeV, which is much less than the energy of 27 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the velocity using the momentum and energy.

Wait, since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v.

So, beta = v/c = p c / (E).

So, beta = (p c)/E.

But to find beta, perhaps I should compute it using E and m.

We have E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c^2)^2.

So, p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) .

But E is given as 27 GeV, and m c² is 3.41 GeV.

So, (pc) = sqrt(27^2 - 3.41^2) GeV ≈ sqrt(729 - 11.63) ≈ sqrt(717.37) ≈ 26.78 GeV.

So, p c ≈26.78 GeV.

Thus, beta = (p c)/E = 26.78 / 27 ≈ 0.99185.

So, beta ≈0.99185.

Which is consistent with our previous calculation of beta ≈0.992.

So, L = beta c tau = 0.99185 * 3e8 m/s * 6.334e-15 s.

Compute that:

3e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s =1.9002e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.99185: 1.9002e-6 *0.99185 ≈1.885e-6 m.

Same as before.

So, x =0.35667 *1.885e-6 ≈6.71e-7 m.

Still, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution in the lab frame, which is the decay length, not the x for 30% probability. But that doesn't fit the question.

Wait, wait the question says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". So, perhaps the resolution must be such that the decay length is at least 30% of the maximum possible or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the required resolution is the 30% of the average decay length.

Wait, 30% of 1.885e-6 m is 5.655e-7 m, which is even smaller than our previous x. But the options don't have that.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps there's a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering gamma as E/(m c^2) including the c^2 factor, but perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait, perhaps the energy is given in GeV, but I should convert it to joules. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because we're using natural units where c is considered, but perhaps I should redo the calculation with proper units.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute gamma as E/(m c²).

E is 27 GeV. m is 3.41 GeV/c².

So, E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c² ) ) = 27/3.41 → same as before, 7.918.

So, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the momentum and then the velocity.

E = gamma m c² → kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². But I don't think that's necessary here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum distance that the decay products are displaced, which is the decay length. If the resolution is the minimum distance that can be detected, then the detector can only observe the decay if the decay length is larger than the resolution. So, the minimum resolution is the maximum x where the probability of the decay being within x is 30%.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the minimum resolution being the distance that 30% of the decays have passed, meaning that only 30% are detected beyond that point. But that would require knowing the survival probability, which is exp(-x/L). So, the survival probability is 0.7 when x = L * ln(1/0.7) = L * 0.35667.

Wait, but that's the same as the previous calculation.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately twice as large as our computed x of 6.8e-7 m. Where does 2.08e-6 come from?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the gamma as 8, leading to L=2e-6 m.

Wait, let me compute L when gamma is exactly 8.

If gamma=8, then tau=8*8e-16=6.4e-15 s.

c tau =3e8 m/s *6.4e-15 s=1.92e-6 m.

x=0.35667 *1.92e-6=6.86e-7 m.

Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using beta as 1, ignoring relativistic effects, which would give L=3e8 *6.4e-15=1.92e-6 m.

Hmm, then perhaps the required resolution is 30% of the average decay length. 0.3 *1.92e-6 m=5.76e-7 m, which is still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the minimum resolution as the mean decay length multiplied by a certain factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the minimum resolution as the full width at a certain probability.

Wait, perhaps the resolution is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the decay distribution. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the proper time and not the observed lifetime. No, because the proper lifetime is given as tau_0.

Wait, perhaps I've been miscalculating the time. Let me double-check the proper lifetime.

Proper lifetime tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. Multiply by gamma=7.918 → tau=6.334e-15 s. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum distance between the collision point and the decay point. So the detector must be able to resolve this distance. The minimum resolution would be the smallest distance that the detector can measure. So, if the particles decay within a distance x (the resolution), then only a fraction of the decays are observed. So, the fraction is the probability P = 1 - exp(-x/L).

We need to find the x such that P >= 0.3.

Which brings us back to x = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = L * 0.3567.

So, using L=1.885e-6 m, x=6.71e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the decay in flight but about something else. Wait, (X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻) is a decay into two particles. The proper lifetime is given, and the question is about the minimum resolution to observe the decay. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum distance that the decay products have moved apart. But that doesn't seem right.

Hmm. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

The proper lifetime is tau_0 =8e-16 s.

The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0.

The average path length L = beta c gamma tau_0.

We have L = beta c gamma tau_0.

We need to find the minimum resolution (distance) x such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, P >= 0.3.

So, P=1 - exp(-x/L) >=0.3 → exp(-x/L) <=0.7 → x >= L * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L * 0.3567.

So, x ≈ 0.3567 * L.

Which is as before.

But the options don't include this value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed of light as 3e8 cm/s instead of m/s. Let me check that.

Wait, no, 3e8 m/s is 3e10 cm/s.

Wait, no, that's not the case. The units were handled correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as beta c, not c. So, L= beta c gamma tau_0.

We have L ≈1.885e-6 m.

If the problem is asking for the minimum resolution, and considering that 30% is within x, perhaps the answer is x = L * ln(2) ≈ 0.693 * L ≈1.3e-6 m, which is 1.3 micrometers. But that's not an option either.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers. Hmm, that's about 2.08 *1e-6 m.

Hmm, 2.08e-6 m is approximately 2.08 micrometers. Let me see, what's 2.08e-6 m in terms of L.

If L is 1.885e-6 m, then 2.08e-6 m is about 1.1 times L. So, x = 1.1 L.

Then, the probability P would be 1 - exp(-1.1) ≈ 1 - 0.3329 ≈ 0.667. So, about 67% probability. But the question is asking for at least 30% of the decays. So, 2.08e-6 m would give about 67% of decays, which is more than 30%, but perhaps the question is seeking the minimum x such that at least 30% is observed. So, the correct x is lower.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum resolution being the mean decay length multiplied by 0.3, but that would be 0.3 *1.885e-6 =5.655e-7 m, which is again not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, perhaps considering the time the particle lives in the detector.

Wait, perhaps the energy is kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me try that.

If E is the kinetic energy, then E = (gamma -1) m c² → gamma = (E / (m c²)) +1.

So, E_kinetic =27 GeV → m c² =3.41 GeV → gamma =27/3.41 +1 ≈7.918 +1=8.918.

Then, tau = gamma tau_0 =8.918 *8e-16 =7.134e-15 s.

c tau =3e8 *7.134e-15=2.1402e-6 m.

x=0.35667 *2.1402e-6≈7.63e-7 m.

Still, no option matches.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is more straightforward. Let me compute gamma as approximately 8, leading to L = c gamma tau_0.

So, L=3e8 *8 *8e-16 = 3e8 *6.4e-15 =1.92e-6 m.

Then, x=0.35667 *1.92e-6 ≈6.86e-7 m.

But again, no option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the minimum resolution as the full width at 30% of the maximum. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum resolution that would still allow 30% detection, which would be higher than our x.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m. Let me compute what x would be if L is 2.08e-6 m.

x =0.35667 *2.08e-6 ≈7.41e-7 m.

But that still doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the decay length, not the x for 30% probability. So, L=1.9e-6 m, which is 1.9e-6 m, approximately 2e-6 m. But the closest option is A:2.08e-6 m.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But why is the answer option A? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma = E/(m c²) exactly.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV/c².

gamma =27 /3.41 =7.918.

Yes.

So, tau =7.918 *8e-16=6.334e-15 s.

c tau =3e8 *6.334e-15=1.9002e-6 m.

So, L=1.9002e-6 m.

Now, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is higher than L.

Wait, but if the resolution is the maximum x that 30% of decays are observed beyond x, then the survival probability is 0.7. So, the fraction that have decayed before x is 0.3, so the fraction that have not yet decayed (survived) is 0.7.

So, the survival probability is exp(-x/L) =0.7 → x= L * ln(1/0.7)=L *0.35667.

So, x=0.35667 *1.9002e-6=6.7e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, which is 2.08e-6 m, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the mean decay length, which is L=1.9e-6 m. But none of the options is exactly that. The closest is A:2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 2.08e-6 is approximately 1.9e-6 *1.095. So, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute gamma precisely.

gamma =27 /3.41:

3.41 ×7=23.87 → 27-23.87=3.13.

3.41 ×0.9=3.069 → 3.13-3.069=0.061.

0.061 /3.41 → 0.0179.

So, gamma=7.9179.

So, beta can be computed more accurately.

gamma =7.9179 → beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - (1/62.7)).

1/62.7 is approx 0.01597.

So 1 -0.01597=0.98403.

sqrt(0.98403)=0.9920.

So, beta=0.9920.

So, L=beta * c gamma tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

gamma tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=6.3343e-15 s.

c*gamma tau_0=3e8 *6.3343e-15=1.90029e-6 m.

Multiply by beta: 1.90029e-6 *0.9920=1.885e-6 m.

So, L=1.885e-6 m.

x=0.35667 *1.885e-6 =6.71e-7 m.

Now, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the beta factor. That is, use L= c gamma tau_0, without beta.

In that case, L=3e8 *6.334e-15=1.9002e-6 m.

x=0.35667 *1.9002e-6 =6.7e-7 m.

Still, no option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the kinetic energy, but in that case, gamma would be higher. But that didn't help either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using relativistic momentum to calculate velocity.

But even that leads back to the same result.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the proper time, not the lab time. Because the proper lifetime is tau_0. But the lifetime observed is longer.

Wait, but the decay length is dependent on the lab frame lifetime.

Hmm.

I'm a bit stuck here. All my calculations don't seem to match any of the options. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere, but I've gone through it several times.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the maximum possible gamma, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution in terms of the velocity. But that seems unrelated.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity in terms of beta and then compute the decay length.

Wait, but I did that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the average speed, which is lower than c. But that's unlikely because beta is close to 1.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the decay length without the beta factor. So, L= c gamma tau_0.

In that case, L=3e8 *6.334e-15=1.9002e-6 m.

So, x=0.35667 *1.9002e-6=6.7e-7 m.

Still no match.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options. Option A is 2.08e-6 m. Let's compute what gamma would lead to L=2.08e-6 m.

L= beta c gamma tau_0.

Assume beta is approximately 1.

Then, L= c gamma tau_0.

So, gamma= L/(c tau_0).

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So, gamma= (2.08e-6 m) / (3e8 m/s *8e-16 s) ) = (2.08e-6) / (2.4e-7) ) ≈8.666.

So, gamma ≈8.666.

Then, E= gamma m c² =8.666 *3.41 GeV= approx 29.57 GeV.

But the given energy is 27 GeV, so this would be inconsistent.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Such as considering the minimum velocity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the time it takes for the particle to decay, and the distance it travels.

But that's what I did earlier.

Well, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and see which option is the closest.

The computed x is approximately 6.7e-7 m, which is 0.67e-6 m. The options provided don't include this, but option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about three times larger.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum distance that the particle travels, so the minimum x is L * (1 - ln(1/(1-0.3)) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mean lifetime and mean path, which is L=1.885e-6 m, and perhaps the answer is option A, which is 2.08e-6 m. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have a calculation leading to option A.

Let me compute 2.08e-6 m in terms of gamma.

If L=2.08e-6 m = beta c gamma tau_0.

Assuming beta=0.992, c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

gamma = 2.08e-6 / (beta c tau_0) ) = 2.08e-6 / (0.992 *3e8 *8e-16) )

Compute denominator:0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s. Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.976e8 *8e-16 = 2.3808e-7 m.

So, gamma= 2.08e-6 / 2.3808e-7 ≈8.74.

So, gamma=8.74.

Which would imply that E= gamma * m c² → 8.74 *3.41=29.83 GeV.

But the given energy is 27 GeV, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck. After going through all possible angles, I think the intended answer is option A:2.08e-6 m, but I can't see why due to calculation discrepancies.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process and calculate the relevant parameters.

### Key Information and Calculations:
1. **Decay Proper Lifetime**:  
   The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \).

2. **Energy and Mass of \( X^0 \)**:  
   The total energy of \( X^0 \) in the bubble chamber is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).  
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.918.
   \]

3. **Lifetime in the Lab Frame**:  
   The observed lifetime in the lab frame is given by \( \tau = \gamma \tau_0 \):  
   \[
   \tau = 7.918 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
   \]

4. **Decay Length**:  
   The average decay length \( L \) is the distance traveled by \( X^0 \) before decaying, assuming \( v \approx c \):  
   \[
   L = c \tau = (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}) \approx 1.9002 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
   \]

5. **Minimum Resolution for 30% Decays**:  
   The probability of a particle decaying within a distance \( x \) is given by:  
   \[
   P = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{x}{L}\right).
   \]  
   To observe at least 30% of the decays (\( P \geq 0.3 \)), we solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   0.3 = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{x}{L}\right) \implies \exp\left(-\frac{x}{L}\right) = 0.7.
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   -\frac{x}{L} = \ln(0.7) \implies x = -L \ln(0.7).
   \]  
   Using \( \ln(0.7) \approx -0.35667 \):  
   \[
   x = 0.35667 \times L = 0.35667 \times 1.9002 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated \( x \approx 6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \) (or \( 0.671 \, \mu\text{m} \)) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**, which is approximately three times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests either a rounding difference or an assumption in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is best approximated by **Option A**.
