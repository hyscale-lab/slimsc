Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar atmospheres and elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, the problem is about elemental abundances, so I wonder if the mass plays a role here. I think it might not directly affect the calculation because the question is about the photospheric compositions. Maybe the mass is just additional info, or perhaps it's a distractor.

The data provided is about their elemental ratios. For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh, and the Sun's photosphere has given values: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7.

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2] or something like that? Wait, no, wait. The question is the ratio of silicon atoms between Star_1 and Star_2. So, like, (n_Si1)/(n_Si2) ?

Wait, no, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that would be the number of silicon atoms per unit in Star_1 divided by the number in Star_2, which is [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2]. But I'm not sure yet. Let's think.

First, let's get the definitions straight. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, relative to the Sun. So [X/Y]_star = log10(n_X/n_Y in star) - log10(n_X/n_Y in Sun) = log10( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

Wait, no, more precisely, the definition is [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_{star} / (n_X / n_Y)_{sun} )

So for example, [Fe/H] for a star is log10( (Fe/H)_star / (Fe/H)_sun ). If [Fe/H] is 0, that means (Fe/H)_star equals (Fe/H)_sun.

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun.

Wait, let me get the Sun's composition first. The problem says:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 â†’ log10(nFe/nH)
