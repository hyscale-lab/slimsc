Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, so we're focusing just on the orbital part. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1, which makes sense for a p orbital. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for both electrons. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Hmm. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is given by Lz for each. The eigenvalues are m₁ħ for the first electron and m₂ħ for the second. So if we measure both and get -ħ each, that means m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1.

Wait, but in the coupled state, what do the m values look like? The coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. The m here is the total m, which is m₁ + m₂. So in this case, m = -1. That adds up to m₁ + m₂ = -1.

But wait, each electron has l=1, so their m can be -1, 0, or +1. So the possible pairs (m₁, m₂) that sum to -1 are:

(0, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, -1 + something? Wait, no: let me list all possibilities.

Wait, m₁ can be -1, 0, +1. Same for m₂. So sum m = m₁ + m₂ = -1.

So possible pairs are:

m₁ = -1, m₂=0 (sum -1)

m₁=0, m₂=-1 (sum -1)

m₁=1, m₂=-2 → but m₂ can't be -2 because l=1 allows m=-1,0,+1. So those are the only two possibilities.

Wait, no. Wait a second. m₁ can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly for m₂. So let's list all possible (m₁, m₂) pairs:

(-1, -1) → sum m = -2

(-1, 0) → sum -1

(-1, +1) → sum 0

(0, -1) → sum -1

(0, 0) → sum 0

(0, +1) → sum +1

(+1, -1) → sum 0

(+1, 0) → sum +1

(+1, +1) → sum +2

So the only pairs that give m= -1 are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of these two states.

So the state |l₁, l₂, l, m> is a coupling of the individual states. The question is, what is the expansion of |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |m₁, m₂>?

Wait, no. Wait, in angular momentum coupling, the state |l₁, l₂, l, m> is built from the product states |m₁, m₂> such that m₁ + m₂ = m. So for our case, m = -1, so the possible |m₁, m₂> are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m₁= -1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>. But wait, how exactly?

I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, you have to consider Clebsch-Gordan
