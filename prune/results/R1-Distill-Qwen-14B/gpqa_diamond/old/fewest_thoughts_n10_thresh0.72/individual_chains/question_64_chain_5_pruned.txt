Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. Only a mixture of gases formed. Then, this gas mixture was passed through several tubes. Tube 1 had anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, tube 2 had Ca(OH)2 solution, and tube 3 had red-hot copper. The results were: tube 1 gained 3.60g, tube 3 gained 0.80g, and tube 2's weight didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let's think about what each part means. When the salts are heated, they probably decompose. The gases that form are then passed through these tubes, which are meant to react with certain gases.

So, tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is highly deliquescent and can absorb moisture. So, maybe it's reacting with water vapor? Because when water vapor passes over it, Mg(ClO4)2 would gain mass as it absorbs H2O.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If a gas is passed through a solution of Ca(OH)2, it would react if it's acidic. But if the gas isn't reacting, then tube 2's weight didn't change, meaning no reaction. So the gas passing through wasn't acidic. Maybe it's a neutral or inert gas.

Tube 3: Red-hot copper. The gas passed through it, and the weight increased by 0.80g, with CuO formed. Red-hot copper reacting with a gas—possibly a reaction where the gas is oxidized. For example, carbon monoxide (CO) can be oxidized to CO2 in the presence of copper. Or maybe hydrogen reacting with copper? Wait, but under what conditions? Oh, wait, red-hot copper would typically act as a catalyst or maybe a reducing agent. Alternatively, if the gas is sulfur dioxide, but that might not fit.

The gas that remains is 2.24 liters at STP. STP is standard temperature and pressure, which is 0°C and 1 atm. I remember that at STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

Let me try to figure out what the initial gases are. When salts A and B are heated, perhaps they decompose into a mix of gases like CO2, H2O, maybe NH3, SO2, H2S, or something else.

But looking at the results:

Tube 1: weight increased by 3.60g. So Mg(ClO4)2 is absorbing some gas. Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, so perhaps it's absorbing water (H2O) from the gas mixture. The mass gained would correspond to the mass of H2O absorbed.

So if the mass increase is 3.60g, that would be the mass of H2O. Let me check: the molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol. So 0.2 moles of H2O were absorbed in tube 1.

Now, the gas that passed through tube 1 would have had 0.2 moles of H2O removed. Then, the next tubes process the remaining gases.

After tube 1, the gas goes through tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution). The weight didn't change, so no reaction. That suggests that the remaining gas doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. So, maybe the remaining gas is a non-acidic gas, like CO, N2, CH4, or maybe an inert gas. But wait, if the gas didn't react, perhaps it's a neutral gas like CO2? Wait, but CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But the problem says the weight didn't change, so maybe the gas didn't pass through that part, or perhaps it's a noble gas. Alternatively, maybe the gas isn't present in that tube.

Wait, but the problem says that after tube 3, 2.24 L of gas C remained. So perhaps the gas that enters tube 3 is something that can react with copper. Let's think about gas transformations.
