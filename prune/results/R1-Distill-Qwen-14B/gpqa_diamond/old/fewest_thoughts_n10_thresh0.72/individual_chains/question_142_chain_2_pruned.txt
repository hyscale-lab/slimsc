Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And the options are A to D, each with different r coordinates.

Wait, what do I remember about density matrices? They represent the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. A density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1 and be idempotent (squared equals itself), but for mixed states, it's a statistical mixture.

Looking at the matrix ρ, let me compute what it looks like. The |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the first position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 1 in the second position. So adding them together gives a 2x2 diagonal matrix with [1, 1]. Then, multiplying by 1/2 gives ρ = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 0.5.

Now, I'm supposed to find its geometrical position in qubits space. Wait, qubits are 2-level systems, so they can be represented as vectors in a 2-dimensional space. But when talking about the space of density matrices, it's a bit different. The space of all 2x2 density matrices is actually a 3-dimensional space because a 2x2 matrix has four elements, but due to trace condition (sum of diagonal is 1) and Hermiticity (so only real elements and symmetric), it reduces to 3 parameters.

But wait, another approach: the Bloch sphere. Oh right, for single qubit states, the density matrix can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which is a vector on the surface of the Bloch sphere. For mixed states, it's inside the sphere.

But this ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So that's equal to (|0⟩⟨0|)/2 + (|1⟩⟨1|)/2. Each of these is a pure
