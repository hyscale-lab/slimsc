Okay, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

So, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that suggests it's an aromatic compound because of the high number of carbon atoms and the heteroatoms. The NMR data is provided, which should help in determining the structure.

Looking at the 1H-NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7. A triplet in that region usually indicates an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes other deshielded protons like those adjacent to an electronegative group can show up here. But an aldehyde would fit as a triplet if it's next to another proton, maybe in a coupling situation.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet with two protons. This might be part of an aromatic ring, perhaps para-substituted. Like two protons next to substituents on a benzene ring.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet. Possibly another pair of aromatic protons, maybe in another ring. Could be another benzene ring adjacent to something.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet. Two protons here. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like in a phenol or an ether. Or maybe part of a conjugated system, like near a carbonyl group.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, two protons. This could be a methylene group (CH2) attached to something electronegative. Maybe next to an oxygen, like an ether, or adjacent to an aromatic ring.

Putting this together, I'm thinking the structure might involve two benzene rings connected by some chain. Let's think about possible structures with two phenyl groups.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/
