Okay, I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem about gene interactions related to disease resistance in white lupine. Let me take it step by step.

So, the setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They knocked each out individually and made double mutants as well. The resistance to anthracnose is what's being measured. The control is 100% resistance, so lower percentages mean more susceptibility.

The results are as follows:
- G1: 75% (so less resistance than wild-type)
- G2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- G3: 50% (moderately susceptible)
- G1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- G2g3: 0% (same as G2)
- G1g2: 0% (same as G2)

Hmm. Also, we know that at least one of these is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors usually regulate other genes, so they might be master regulators.

Let's think about the possibilities. If a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would disable the regulation of other genes, which might be necessary for resistance.

Looking at the individual mutants:
- G2 knockout has 0% resistance, which is the most severe. So G2 must be really important. Maybe G2 is the transcription factor because it's completely knocked out and the resistance is gone. But wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it activates other genes. But looking at G1 and G3, their resistance is 75% and 50%, which are not zero. So perhaps G2 is acting upstream.

But wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would prevent the expression of its target genes, leading to loss of resistance. So the phenotype would be the same as if all those target genes are knocked out. Looking at the individual knockouts, G2 knockout is 0%, which is the most severe. So maybe G2 is the TF, and its targets are G1 and/or G3.

But let's look at the double mutants. Let's see the possible interactions.

G1 has 75% resistance. So without G1, they're less resistant but still have some. G3 has 50%, so even less. But when G1 and G3 are both knocked out (g1g3), resistance drops to 10%. That's much lower than either individual. So perhaps G1 and G3 are working in parallel pathways or have some additive effect. Or maybe when both are gone, the resistance plummets.

Looking at the double mutants involving G2:
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Since g2 alone is 0%, adding g1 doesn't change it. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. So G2's function is upstream of G1. Because when G2 is knocked out, G1 doesn't matter anymore.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%. So G2 is epistatic
