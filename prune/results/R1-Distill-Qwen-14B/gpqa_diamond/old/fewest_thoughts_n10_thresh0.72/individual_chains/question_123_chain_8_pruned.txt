Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think it through.

The problem says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames of reference. So, they're moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that seems super fastâ€”like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So, this is a problem involving special relativity because the speeds are a significant fraction of c.

The question is asking, how far does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, we have to find the distance in the galaxy's perspective when the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds have passed.

I remember that in special relativity, time dilation and length contraction come into play. But wait, in this case, the two frames are moving relative to each other. So, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But wait, no, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it. So the relative velocity is such that v is 60,00
