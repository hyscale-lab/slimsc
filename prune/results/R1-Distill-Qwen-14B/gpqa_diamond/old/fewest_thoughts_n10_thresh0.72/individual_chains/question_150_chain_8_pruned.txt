Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and I need to determine the final product after a series of reactions. The reagents used are first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat.

Let me jot down the NMR data points:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H
- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H

Hmm, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation: could be one ring and four double bonds or similar. Wait, that's a lot. Let me think about possible structures.

Looking at the NMR, the 9.72 ppm is a triplet for 1H. That's a high chemical shift—likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm, and the triplet suggests splitting from two neighboring protons, perhaps in a conjugated system.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets each for 2H. Those are in the aromatic region, so possibly para-substituted phenyl groups. The doublets suggest coupling with adjacent protons. Wait, but if they're para, usually the protons are equivalent and might show up as a singlet unless there's coupling through substituents.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet—maybe an enol proton or something with exchange, like an -OH? But wait, in the NMR, 6.27 is in the aromatic region but as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated diene or something else.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. That's around where CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen (like OCH2) appear. So maybe an -OCH2- group. But why a doublet? The two protons are adjacent to another set of protons. Maybe it's part of a chain, like CH2 connected to another CH2.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something with an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 ppm), a couple of aromatic rings (from the 6.98 and 6.51), a conjugated system (from the 6.27), and an OCH2 group.

Wait, another thought: the 9.72 triplet for 1H is the aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests that it's next to two protons. So maybe the structure is an aldehyde with an adjacent CH2 group. Like RCHO with CH2 next to it.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm doublet (2H): perhaps a CH2O group, like CH2 connected to an oxygen. So maybe the structure is something like Ar-O-CH2-CH2-CHO? Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated enal.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm (2H, bs) could be part of a conjugated double bond. Like a CH2=CH-CHO structure. Alternatively, it's a di-substituted benzene with some substituents, but I'm not sure yet.
