Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, relativistic, so I probably need to use special relativity equations. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities normally. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Both are moving in the same direction, so v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. Let me plug those in.

Wait, wait, which one is v1 and which is v2? Oh, because they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the first with respect to the second would be the difference. So if astronaut A is 0.6c and astronaut B is 0.5c, then from B's frame, A is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that denominator. 0.6 *0.5 = 0.3, so 0.3 c². Divided by c², that's 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

The numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c, which matches one of the options.

Now for the total energy of the system. In relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of their rest masses. Each astronaut's total energy is gamma times m c squared. So I need to calculate each gamma and then sum the energies.

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v = 0.6c, v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma * m c² * 2m? Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The formula is E = gamma * m_rest * c². So m_rest is 2m for the first, and 3m for the second.

Let me compute E1: gamma1 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, no, wait. Gamma is 1.25 for the first, so 1.25 multiplied by 2m c². So 1.25 *2 = 2.5, so yes, 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. So gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Hmm, sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.866. So 1/0.866 is about 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 *3 = 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That fits.

Option D says E=5 mc², which is less than what I calculated.

Wait, wait, but wait a minute. The question is about the total energy of the system. Do I just sum their energies as measured in the same frame? Because each is moving in the same direction, are they in the same inertial frame, or do I have to calculate from another perspective? Oh, I think the question is asking for the sum of their energies as observed from the same frame, perhaps the rest frame in which both are moving (but that's not possible, because they have different speeds). Or wait, maybe the frame where the combined system is at rest? No, that's not the case here because they're moving in the same direction.

Wait, no. The total energy is the sum of each astronaut's energy as measured in the same frame. Which frame? Probably the frame where the system's center of momentum is at rest, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering each astronaut's energy in their own rest frames, but that's not how it's phrased.

Wait no, the question says "the total energy of the system." Hmm, perhaps the system's rest frame. So in that case, the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies in that frame. But wait, that's more complex, because their velocities in that frame would be different. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just adding the energies in the same frame as the initial velocities are given. Hmm, because both astronauts are moving in the same direction, but perhaps their rest frames are different. But the way the problem is phrased, it's unclear. Let me re-read the question.

The question says, "the total energy of the system." So, I think the energy would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut in the same reference frame. The problem gives their speeds as 0.6c and 0.5c in the same positive x-direction. So the frame is the one where the ground is stationary, perhaps. So each astronaut's energy is calculated in this frame, and then added.

So, yes, E1 is 2.5 mc², E2 is about 3.464 mc², sum is about 5.964 mc². So that's option C, which lists E=5.96 mc².

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

---

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.
