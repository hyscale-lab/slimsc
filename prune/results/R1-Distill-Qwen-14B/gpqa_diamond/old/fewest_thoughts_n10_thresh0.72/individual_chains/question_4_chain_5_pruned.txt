Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about Maxwell's equations in a different universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles together, right? Like you can't just have a single north pole without the south pole. But if that's not the case in this other universe, then Maxwell's equations must change somehow.

Let me think about what Maxwell's equations are. There are four main ones. The first one, Gauss's Law for electricity, deals with the divergence of the electric field and relates it to charge density. I think that wouldn't change because it's about electric fields and charges, which are probably the same in this universe.

The second equation is Gauss's Law for magnetism. Oh wait, in our world, this says that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. That's why there are no isolated magnetic poles—because if you have a divergence, it implies sources, like monopoles. So if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that means the divergence of B isn't zero anymore. So Gauss's Law for magnetism must change. So that equation is different.

The third equation is Faraday's Law of Induction. It deals with the curl of the electric field and how it's related to the time derivative of the magnetic field. I don't think this one would change because it's about how changing magnetic fields create electric fields, which doesn't directly depend on whether there are isolated poles. So Faraday's Law probably stays the same.

The fourth equation is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition. It involves the curl of the magnetic field and relates it to the current density plus the displacement current. Wait, in our universe, Ampère's Law without Maxwell's addition predicts that changing electric fields create magnetic fields, but Maxwell added the displacement current part to make it consistent with electromagnetic waves. I'm not sure, but I don't think Ampère's Law would change just because of isolated poles. Isolated magnetic poles would affect Gauss's Law for magnetism, not Ampère's.

Wait, but in this other universe where monopoles exist, I think that the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. So the second equation (Gauss's Law for B) must change. What about the other equations? Are there any others affected?

Wait, another thought. If magnetic monopoles exist, then the symmetry
