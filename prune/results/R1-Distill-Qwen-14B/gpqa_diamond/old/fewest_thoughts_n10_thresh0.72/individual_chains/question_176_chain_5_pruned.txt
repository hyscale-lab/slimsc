Alright, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Okay, so the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. I remember that when you measure an observable, the state of the system collapses into an eigenstate of the corresponding operator. But wait, I need to think carefully about how this works.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, so their components should be complex numbers and normalized. Let me check the norm here. The vector is (-1, 2, 1), so the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4+1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). But in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized, so maybe I need to normalize this vector. Or wait, perhaps the question assumes that the state is already normalized? Let me check the options again. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed assuming it's given, but when computing probabilities, normalization might come into play.

Wait, no, the state vector's length is sqrt(6), so it's not normalized. But when we compute probabilities, we take the inner product of the state with the eigenvectors, which would automatically account for the normalization. Or maybe the given state is correctly given and we just work with it as is.

The operators P and Q are given as square matrices. The operator P has elements:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

And operator Q is diagonal with elements (1, 0, -1). Wait, no: the first row is (1,0,0), second is (0,0,0), third is (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, and -1.

The question is about measuring Q just after measuring P. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, the measurements are in sequence, first P, then Q.
