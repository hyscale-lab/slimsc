Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says that we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, it's like a benzene ring with two substituents. Di-substituted means two groups attached to the ring. The compound's FTIR shows ester groups. Esters have specific absorption bands, especially around the carbonyl group, which is a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1. So, the presence of an ester is confirmed.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break down what each signal might mean.

First, two aromatic-H signals. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns. If the substituents are meta, para, or ortho. For example, para substitution would give two sets of aromatic protons (each pair being adjacent to substituents but in two different environments). Wait, no, actually, if substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be equivalent in two sets. Wait, maybe not. Let me think: in para substitution, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. So, each aromatic proton is adjacent to a substituent. But wait, benzene is symmetric. So, perhaps the two substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons split into two groups. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent H's. Each set would have two H's, but perhaps they're split into doublets or something else. Hmm, maybe I'll get back to that.

Next, two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those on a double bond, like in an ester group. Wait, esters typically have a carbonyl group and an adjacent oxygen. Let me think about the structure. An ester group is like R-O-CO-O-R', but more accurately, R-O-CO-R'. So, the structure would be something like RCOOR', where R' is an alkyl group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the vinyl H's are from double bonds. Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group
