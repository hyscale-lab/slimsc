Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, I need to figure out which option correctly describes the transition route and the probability. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Wait, dipole transitions... I remember that the selection rules for dipole transitions are important here. So, the selection rules for hydrogen states are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1, right? Or wait, no, wait. For l, the change can be ±1, but for m, it can change by 0, ±1. But wait, in a dipole transition, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. But wait, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So, in an allowed transition, the electron must change its angular momentum quantum number l by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1.

So, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It needs to go to |1,0,0⟩ in two steps. So, the first transition would go from n=3 to n=2, because going from 3 to 1 in one step would require Δn=2, which isn't allowed in a dipole transition. Because for a dipole, the change in n is ±
