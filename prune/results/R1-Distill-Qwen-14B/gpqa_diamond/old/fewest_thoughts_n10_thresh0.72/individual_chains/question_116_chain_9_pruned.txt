Alright, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see, the question involves several steps, so I'll need to take it step by step.

First, let's look at compound A. The proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting can tell us about neighboring protons. So a triplet (which has 2 neighboring groups) and a quartet (which has 3 neighboring groups) suggests that the protons are in a specific environment.

Wait, 0.9 ppm is usually around where methyl groups (CH3) show up, especially if they're next to something else. The triplet for 6H... Well, 6H could be two methyl groups each with three H. Because 2 methyl groups would give 6 H total. But why a triplet? Oh, wait, maybe they're adjacent to another group with two protons. Like a CH2 group.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm is for 4H. That might be a CH2 group (2 H) each, perhaps. But a quartet implies each of these protons has three neighboring protons. So if each of the four H is in a CH2 that's next to a CH2, but wait, actually the quartet splitting would come from coupling with two adjacent protons. No, wait, the quartet is for each of those H. Wait, let me think again. The quartet would arise when each proton is adjacent to a group with three H, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet comes from a CH2 that's next to a CH2 group, which has two protons. Wait, the number of neighboring H's plus one gives the order of the split. So a quartet would have three neighboring H. So perhaps each of the 4H is in a CH2 that is next to a CH2CH3 group? Or maybe it's a CH2 that's next to another CH2 group. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's think of a structure that has two types of protons. The triplet (6H) might be from two equivalent methyl groups, each next to a CH2. So, like CH2CH3 groups. So maybe the structure is a diethyl ether? Because diethyl ether
