Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

The question gives a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are four different vectors r. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on how to map that to a geometrical position. 

So the given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! For a single qubit, the density matrix for a completely mixed state is usually written as I/2, where I is the identity matrix. Let me write that down.

The identity matrix for a 2x2 system is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So when we multiply by 1/2, each element becomes 0.5. So ρ would be:

ρ = [[0.5, 0],
     [0, 0.5]]

Now, I need to find where this state is located geometrically. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. Right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

Wait, but wait, how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector? Oh right, every density matrix can be represented as a vector in the Bloch sphere. The general form for a single qubit density matrix is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where r is a vector with components (x, y, z), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can write the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

Let me do that. Our ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute |0><0| and |1><1|.

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = I/2.

So, I = (I + r·σ) / 2 * 2. Wait, no, wait. Let me set ρ as (I + r·
