Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of isomers and tautomerism. But let's take it step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure each out.

The question says that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two types: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

Now, the problem has two parts. First, I need to determine which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a carbon between two positions, resulting in different isomers. This typically occurs in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups, like in carbonyl compounds. For tautomerism to happen, there should be a conjugated system that allows the shift. So, if a compound doesn't have such a structure, it won't exhibit tautomerism.

Looking at benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Specifically, it's 1,4-benzoquinone, I think. So, it has two ketone groups opposite each other. Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Hmm. Tautomerism usually involves moving a hydrogen from an oxygen to an adjacent carbon, but in benzoquinone, the structure is such that each carbonyl is on opposite ends. There's no adjacent sites for a hydrogen to shift to without breaking the ring structure. Wait, or does it maybe have alpha hydrogens that can shift?

Wait, benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the quinone structure is two carbonyls on a benzene ring. Wait, actually, wait. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So each of the carbonyl groups is attached to the benzene ring, but in positions 1 and 4. So, each is a ketone, but there are no adjacent positions with hydrogens that can shift because the adjacent carbons are all part of the benzene ring. So, perhaps benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because there's no adjacent H to shift.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let's think about that. It's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Wait, so each ketone is separated by one carbon. So the structure would have three carbonyls around the ring. Now, does this allow for tautomerism?

In such a structure, maybe a hydrogen could shift from one carbon next to a carbonyl to another. But wait, in
