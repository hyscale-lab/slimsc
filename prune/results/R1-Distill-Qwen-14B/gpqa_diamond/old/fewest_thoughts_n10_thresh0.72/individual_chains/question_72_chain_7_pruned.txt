Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting with a compound and going through several steps. I think I need to draw out each step to see what's happening. Let me jot down the starting material and each reagent.

The starting compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta... That's norbornene, right? The structure is a bicyclic compound with two rings. The substituent is tert-butoxy at position 7. So I imagine the norbornene structure with an O-t-Bu group attached.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm. That sounds like a diels-alder reaction maybe? Wait, no, wait. Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. The starting material has a diene (norbornene), but the other compound is cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups. Wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a dienophile? Or maybe it's the diene? Let me think: the other compound has two CH2Br2 groups attached, right? Because dibromomethyl is CH2Br2.

Wait, when you have diels-alder, you need a conjugated diene and a dienophile (like a molecule with a double bond that can react). So the norbornene might be the diene. But wait, norbornene is a bicyclic system, and I think it's a diene itself. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the diene, and the norbornene is acting as a dienophile? Or maybe using a different reaction.

Wait, the presence of sodium iodide (NaI) and high temperature makes me think of elimination or substitution reactions, perhaps an E2 mechanism. Or maybe some kind of nucleophilic substitution. But wait, the other compound has dibromomethyl groupsâ€”Br is a good leaving group. So maybe the norbornene is reacting with this dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, but Diels-Alder typically uses a diene and a dienophile. The norbornene has a conjugated diene, I believe, because it's hepta-2,5-diene. So positions 2 and 5 have double bonds. So that would be a conjugated diene, making it a good diene. The other molecule is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups. So perhaps the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile? Wait, no, dienophiles are usually electron-deficient. A cyclohexadiene might not be the best dienophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a diene in a different reaction.

Wait, but the treatment is with sodium iodide. Maybe it's a coupling reaction. Alternatively, maybe the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing substitution. Oh! Wait, sodium iodide in an elimination reaction? Or perhaps it's part of a ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cycloaddition. Wait, but let me think about the structure of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene. The substituents are at positions 5 and 6, each with a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is -CH2Br2. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Those are good leaving groups perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction where the norbornene is the diene and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile. Or maybe the other way around. Let me think about the structure. The norbornene has a conjugated diene, so it's a good diene. The cyclohexadiene has a conjugated diene as well, but with two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a [4+2] cycloaddition between norbornene and the other diene, but that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group, which is a good electron-donating group. Maybe the norbornene is opening up in the presence of a dienophile. Wait, but the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an alkylation. The NaI might be a catalyst for some kind of substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-addition. Or maybe it's a
