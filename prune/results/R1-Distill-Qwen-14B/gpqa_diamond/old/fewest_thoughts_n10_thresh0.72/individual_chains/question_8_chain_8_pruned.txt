Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step. 

The setup is about white lupine and a fungal disease called anthracnose. The experiment aims to find genes that contribute to resistance. They've identified three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They created knockout mutants (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

From what I remember, a knockout mutant is when a gene is disabled, so the plant can't produce the product of that gene. The double mutants have two genes knocked out. 

The question is about the resistance of these mutants to anthracnose. The control has 100% resistance, so any mutant with less than that is more susceptible. 

The results are given as percentages of the control's resistance. Let me note them down:

- g1: 75% → So, g1 mutant has 75% resistance. That means it's less resistant than wild type. So, G1 is important but not fully essential for resistance, maybe part of a redundant pathway?
- g2: 0% → No resistance. So G2 is critical. If G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the disease at all. This suggests G2 might be a transcription factor because if it's upstream, the downstream genes wouldn't be expressed, leading to no resistance.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance. So G3 is also important but not as critical as G2. Maybe it's part of a parallel pathway or downstream of G2?
- g1g3: 10% → Very low resistance. That's worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So together they make things worse? Maybe they function in separate pathways, and when both are gone, there's no redundancy left.
- g2g3: 0% → Same as g2. So in the double mutant, the resistance is same as when only G2 is knocked out. Hmm, what does this mean? Maybe G3 is downstream of G2. So when G2 is knocked out, G3 isn't active regardless. So in the double mutant, same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → Same as g2. So when G1 and G2 are both knocked out, resistance is same as when only G2 is knocked out. So G1 might be downstream of G2. Or perhaps G2 is upstream of G1, so without G2, G1 isn't functional. So the double mutant doesn't add anything beyond g2's effect.

The question is about the interaction among these genes, particularly focusing on which is a transcription factor (acting upstream) and the relationships between them.

The initial clue is that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. The results suggest that G2 is critical because its knockout completely lacks resistance. G2's double mutants (g1g2 and g2g3) also have 0%, which suggests that when G2 is out, the other gene's status doesn't matter. So G2 is higher up in the pathway, maybe a transcription factor regulating others.

So let's hypothesize that G2 is the transcription factor. Because without it, the others can't function. That makes sense because if G2 is a TF, it activates other genes. So the downstream genes' effects are masked when G2 is absent.

Looking at g1: 75% resistance. So without G1, resistance drops, but not as much as when G2 is gone. Maybe G1 is downstream of G2 but contributes to some level of resistance. Or perhaps it's part of a parallel pathway that doesn't require G2.

Wait, but in the double mutants, when G2 and G1 are both knocked out (g1g2), the resistance is same as when only G2 is knocked out (g2). So G1's function doesn't contribute anything when G2 is already gone. That suggests that G1 is downstream of G2, meaning G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is upstream, then without G2, you can't have G1's products anyway. So the double mutant doesn't change the phenotype from the single G2 mutant. That fits with G2 being upstream (like a TF) of G1.

Similarly, for the double mutant g2g3, the resistance is 0%. Which is same as g2. So in this case, whether G3 is present or not doesn't matter when G2 is gone. So again, G3's function is dependent on G2, which suggests G2 is upstream of G3 as well.

Wait, but G3's single mutant is 50% resistance. So without G2, G3 doesn't contribute, but with G2, G3 is involved. So perhaps G3 is downstream of G2.

So if G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it activates both G1 and G3. Then, G1 and G3 each contribute to resistance. 

Let me think about the double mutants:

g1g3: resistance is 10%. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So if they're both downstream of G2, then even in the presence of G2, without G1 and G3, the resistance is very low. But if the single mutants have some resistance, perhaps each provides partial resistance, but together they are worse? Or maybe each contributes to a different aspect.

Wait, but in the case of g1g3, without both G1 and G3, the resistance is 1
