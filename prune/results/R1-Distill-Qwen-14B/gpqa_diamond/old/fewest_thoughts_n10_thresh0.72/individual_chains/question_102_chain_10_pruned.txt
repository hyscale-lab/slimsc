Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about some molecular biology techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves some genetic constructs and experiments to see if they're expressed correctly. The main issue is that after breeding mice and testing, there's no green signal observed under the confocal microscope. 

First, let's parse the details of the construct. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two coding regions (ligand and receptor) under a single promoter. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Looking at the regulatory elements: the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. So IRES typically allows for internal ribosome entry, which can drive the translation of the downstream ORF, even if the upstream one is being translated. So the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is weaker but allows for some expression.

Now, the stop cassettes: between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. These are stop signals that prevent expression unless the appropriate Cre recombinase is present to excise them. LoxP is Cre-dependent, and lox2272 is Flp-dependent, I think. Wait, no, lox2272 is a variant that's recognized by Cre, but when combined with loxP, it allows for recombination only when both are present. So, in this setup, if only Cre is present, the loxP and lox2272 sites might recombine in a way that allows both cassettes to be removed. But I need to think about how this works.

Wait, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So, it's a Cre-dependent vector. The ligand is under CBA, and there's a stop cassette between ligand and mCherry. So, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed because the CBA promoter is strong, but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is after an IRES, which is a weaker promoter, and there's a stop between receptor and eGFP. So, under normal conditions, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, but the stop would prevent eGFP from being expressed. The receptor would be expressed weakly via IRES, but the eGFP would be blocked.

But when Cre is introduced, the loxP sites would recombine. So, the stop cassette after ligand would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 sites would be removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed. Wait, but lox2272 is a different site. Oh right, Cre can recognize loxP sites, but lox2272 is a variant that's recognized as well, but it requires Cre to excise. So if both loxP and lox2272 are present as a cassette, perhaps the Cre would remove the stop in both cases.

So, in the presence of Cre, both the ligand and receptor constructs should be expressed, along with their respective fluorescent tags. 

Now, the experiment: they crossed the homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably under the control of SOX10 promoter, meaning it's expressed in neural crest-derived cells. So the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, leading to the excision of the stop cassettes, and thus expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But in the results, they didn't see a green signal. The green comes from eGFP, which is attached to the receptor. So why is eGFP not being expressed?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression of the constructs in the same cell, so this might not explain the lack of GFP.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the construct isn't properly trafficked, the GFP wouldn't be on the surface, but I'm not sure if this would prevent expression entirely. Also, the presence of Cre would mean the receptor is expressed, so Western blot should show it.

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. If the promoters aren't working, both proteins wouldn't be expressed. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, a weaker promoter but still functional. So unless the construct is missing the promoter elements, this might not be the case. However, perhaps the CBA promoter isn't correctly placed, but the question states the ligand is under CBA, which should be good.

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct with two ORFs. If the stop cassettes are in the correct frame, then the receptors and eGFP would be in frame. Alternatively, if the stop cassette is in a way that the frameshift causes the eGFP to be out of frame, then
