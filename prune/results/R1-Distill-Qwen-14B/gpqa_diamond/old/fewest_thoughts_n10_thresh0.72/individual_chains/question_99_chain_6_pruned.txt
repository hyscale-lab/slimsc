Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different organic compounds, all of which seem to have a similar structure but with varying substituents. I need to figure out which one matches the given spectral data.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. I remember that FTIR peaks can tell us a lot about functional groups in the molecule.

The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably due to O-H stretching. Wait, but O-H can give broad peaks, especially if it's a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the O-H is quite acidic and the hydrogen bonds lead to a broad peak in the IR. So that makes sense. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group.

The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That fits with a carboxylic acid since they have a carbonyl group. Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone, but given the O-H peak, it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that several peaks are observed, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, meaning no vinylic protons. That aligns with the structure of a carboxylic acid; the carbonyl is attached to an -OH group, so the molecule wouldn't have any double bonds (unless it's something else, but the options don't show any double bonds anyway).

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns.

A doublet suggests each proton is next to one neighboring set of protons (like one adjacent group). A triplet would come from two neighboring protons. But when we have combinations like doublet of triplet, it's because each proton is coupled with two different sets of neighboring protons.

Wait, more accurately, when a proton is split by two different groups, each with a different number of protons, you can get a multiplet. For example, a proton adjacent to two different groups, each with a different number of Hs, would have a splitting that's a combination. So, let's say a CH2 group next to a CH and another CH2. Each coupling would add to the splitting.

Looking at the options, the structures vary, so I need to examine each.

The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
B) CH3CH2C
