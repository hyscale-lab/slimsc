Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about the 1H NMR spectrum of a solution that's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. That probably means each aromatic region is contributing equally. Then, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. Hmm, okay, that's interesting.

The options given are four possible pairs of compounds. Let me list them:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check the structures of each compound to confirm.

For tetramethylbenzenes, each has four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring. So benzene (C6H6) plus four CH3 groups. That makes C10H14, which matches the molecular formula. So all the tetramethylbenzenes are okay. But what about 1,4-diethylbenzene?

Diethyl would be two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is C2H5, so two of them would be C4H10. Benzene plus C4H10 is C10H16. Oh wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have formula C10H16. But the problem says both compounds are C10H14, so 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H16, which doesn't fit. That means option C can't be the correct answer because one of the compounds in option C has the wrong molecular formula.

So option C is out. That leaves options A, B, D.

Now, looking at the NMR. Let's think about the aromatic region first. The two singlets at 6.7 ppm each in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes equally to the signals. So, each compound must have a certain number of equivalent protons in the aromatic region that would lead to a singlet when each is present.

Wait, but each compound would have its own set of aromatic protons. However, in the mixture, they add up. So, perhaps each compound has only one type of aromatic proton equivalent, leading to a singlet. Or maybe their aromatic protons overlap in such a way that each gives a sing
