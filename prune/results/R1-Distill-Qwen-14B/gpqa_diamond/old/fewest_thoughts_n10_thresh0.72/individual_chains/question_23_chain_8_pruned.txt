Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's typically an addition reaction, probably following Markovnikov's rule. 

The compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that out. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether group is connected to a butenyl chain. The structure would be something like O-benzene connected to a CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. The but-3-en-1-yl group has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, right? So the structure is: the ether (O-) is connected to carbon 1 of the butenyl chain. Carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is CH, and carbon 4 is CH2 with a double bond. Wait, but the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the but-3-en-1-yl is 1,2,2-dimethyl but-3-en-1-yl. Let me get the structure right. 

So, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But wait, the substituent here is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but wait, no, wait. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is four carbons with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but no, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But wait, that can't be right because butenyl has four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think. The structure would have the
