Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector needs to be normalized, right? So I'm wondering if I need to normalize it first. Oh wait, maybe the given vector is already normalized? Let's check. 

The state vector is a column vector with components (-1, 2, 1). To find its norm, I square each component and add them up. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Summing those gives 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which is about 2.45. Since it's not 1, the state vector isn't normalized. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector is supposed to have a norm of 1 because it's a probability amplitude. So maybe I need to normalize it first before proceeding.

Wait, but the problem says it's a column matrix. Oh, but that's the state vector, right? So I think the first step is to normalize it. So to make it a unit vector, I need to divide each component by its norm sqrt(6). So the normalized state |ψ> would be (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).

Wait, but wait a second. The observable is given by the matrix P, which is a 3x3 matrix. The elements in the first row are (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, let me write that out:

P =
[ 0      1/√2   0    ]
[1/√2   0     1/√2 ]
[ 0      1/√2   0    ]

Wait, but what are the eigenvalues of P? Because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of this operator. Oh, but the problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 as the measurement outcome. So I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then compute the projection.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to approach this by considering that the measurement is in terms of the eigenbasis of P. But perhaps a better approach is to find the expectation value, but no, the question is about the probability of getting 0.

So, let me think. The observable P is a matrix, and we need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0.

Wait, but first, perhaps I should find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. Let me compute the eigenvalues of P.

The matrix P is symmetric, so it's diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues will be real. Let me set up the characteristic equation by finding the determinant of (P - λ I) = 0.

So, P - λ I is:

[ -λ      1/√2     0   ]
[1/√2    -λ      1/√2 ]
[ 0      1/√2    -λ   ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero. Let me compute that.

The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved, but let's expand along the first row.

det = -λ * det[ (-λ, 1/√2), (1/√2, -λ) ) ] - (1/√2) * det[ (1/√2, 1/√2), (0, -λ) ) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, expanding along first row:

det = (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0.

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-λ) * [ λ^2 - (1/2) ) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ (-λ / √2 ) - 0 ] = -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) = (λ)/(2 )

Third term: zero.

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2) + (λ)/(2)

Expanding the first part: -λ^3 + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2.

Wait, because (-λ)(λ^2) is -λ^3, and (-λ)(-1/2) is + λ*(1/2). So the first term is (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2).

The second part is (λ/2), as I wrote.

So adding them together: (-λ^3 + λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

Set determinant to zero:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ(-λ^2 + 1) = 0 → λ (λ^2 -1)(-1) )= 0 → λ (λ^2 -1) )= 0 → So λ=0, or λ^2=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

The problem asks for the probability of getting 0.

So the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in the state |ψ>.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should find the eigenvectors for P with eigenvalue 0.

So for eigenvalue λ=0, the equation (P - 0 I) |v> = 0.

So P |v> = 0.

So the system is:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Row3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → same as row 1, v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2=0, and v1 = -v3. Let's choose v3 as a parameter, say v3 = t.

So v1 = -t, v2=0, v3 = t.

So the eigenvector can be written as t*( -1, 0, 1 ). To make it a unit vector, we normalize it.

The vector (-1, 0, 1) has a norm of sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 +1^2 )= sqrt(2). So the unit eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1, 0, 1).

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T. But wait, earlier I thought it was not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first.

Wait, no, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). So perhaps I need to normalize it. Let me compute its norm:

||ψ|| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1).

Wait, but the problem didn't mention whether it's normalized. Hmm. But in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized. So I think I should proceed with the normalized state.

So the state vector |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 in the state |ψ>.

The eigenvector for λ=0 is |0> = ( -1, 0, 1 ) / sqrt(2).

So the inner product <0|ψ> is [ (-1, 0, 1)/sqrt(2) ] · [ (-1, 2, 1) / sqrt(6) ].

Compute this:

= [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + (1)(1) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )

= [ 1 + 0 +1 ] / sqrt(12)

= 2 / (2*sqrt(3)) ) --> because sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3).

Simplify: 2/(2√3) = 1/√3.

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude, which is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3, which corresponds to option C.


To solve the problem, we first note that the state vector of the system is given as \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). In quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. The norm of the vector is calculated as:

\[
\| \psi \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, the observable \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The possible measurement outcomes correspond to the eigenvalues of \( P \). To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). Expanding the determinant, we find the eigenvalues to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

The problem asks for the probability of measuring \( 0 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is determined by solving \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). This yields the eigenvector:

\[
|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |0\rangle \). The projection is computed as:

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Performing the dot product:

\[
\langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left[ (-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) \right] = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude:

\[
P(0) = \left| \langle 0 | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
