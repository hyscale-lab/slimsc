Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction where a pi bond moves into a sigma bond. Examples include Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are both [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

The problem has three separate reactions to complete, and I need to match the products (A, B, C) with the given options. The options are A to D, each giving different structures for A, B, and C.

Let me look at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A.

Hmm, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on a central carbon attached to an amine. The structure is like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. But wait, no, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2? Or maybe N,N-dimethoxyethylamine? Wait, no, ethan-1-amine is NH2CH2CH3, but 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OMe groups on the first carbon. So it's NH2-C(OCH3)2-CH3? Wait, no, maybe ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But if it's 1,1-dimethoxy, then the structure is OCH3 substituted on the same carbon as the NH2. So the structure is more like (OCH3)2CH-NH2? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe it's more like (CH3O)2CHNH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is NH2CH2CH3. So the 1 position is the first carbon, so the amin is on C1. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OMe groups on C1. So structure is OCH3-OCH3 attached to the same C as NH2. So the molecule is (OCH3)2CH2NH2
