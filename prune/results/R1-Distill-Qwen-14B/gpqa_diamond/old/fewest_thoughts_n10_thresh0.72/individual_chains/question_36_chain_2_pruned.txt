Okay, so I've got this question about absorption lines in the Milky Way, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me think through this.

The question says that observations are being made of structures about 2.1 gigaparsecs away. The absorption line energy equivalent is 3.9 micro electron volts. Hmm. I need to connect this to what's observed in the Milky Way.

I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by E = hc/λ. But wait, the question is about absorption lines, which are typically from electrons transitioning between energy levels in atoms or molecules. The energy of the line would correspond to the transition.

Wait, but wait—the energy equivalent here is 3.9e-6 eV. That's a really small number. Micro is 1e-6, so 3.9e-6 eV is about 3.9 micro electron volts. That's quite low. I think I've heard that lower energies correspond to longer wavelengths, like infrared or even radio. Because longer wavelengths (like radio) have lower energy photons.

But wait, absorption lines in the interstellar medium—like from atoms or molecules. Let me think. In the interstellar medium, there are different components: hot, warm, cold. Cold is like the dense molecular clouds, right? Warm is less dense but still colder than the average, and hot is maybe in the ionized regions.

Atomic hydrogen emits the 21 cm line, which is in the radio part of the spectrum. The energy for that is about 5.87e-6 eV. Wait,
