Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I'm trying to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit that property. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That usually happens when there's a chiral center or some form of stereoisomerism like in geometric isomerism but wait, I think geometric isomerism doesn't lead to optical isomers because they are not chiral. Or wait, no, geometric isomerism is about cis-trans and such, but for optical isomerism, you need a chiral element, like a tetrahedral chiral center or some kind of axial chirality or something else.

So the question gives four compounds, and I need to check each one. Let's go through them one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected at position 1. But wait, the substituents are at 2,2' positions, and 6,6' have nitro groups. Wait, but in biphenyls, if the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides, does that lead to cis or trans? But wait, biphenyls can have different conformations but for stereoisomerism, the substituents must be arranged in a way that prevents free rotation. Wait, no, biphenyl rings can rotate, but if the substituents are on adjacent positions, like para, then maybe it can have some kind of restricted rotation? Hmm, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, if the substituents on the biphenyl are in positions that lead to a plane of symmetry, then even if they are arranged symmetrically, there might not be a chiral center. Let me think. Wait, 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the structure is two phenyl rings connected at 1 and 1', each with a nitro at 6 and 6' (so that's the para position on each ring?), and the dicarboxylate at 2 and 2' positions. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in the para positions relative to the connecting bond. Wait, wait, but wait, in 1,1'-biphenyl, the numbering is such that each ring is connected at position 1, so for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So that would be: on each ring, the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions relative to the connecting point. So in each ring, the nitro is at 6 and the carboxylate at 2? Or is it that each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, but on the other ring, same substituents? So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions could lead to a chiral center in the biphenyl system?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Biphenyls can have different isomers if the substituents are arranged in such a way that they don't have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are in positions that create a chiral center around the central bond. But wait, the central bond is a single bond, so the two rings can rotate with respect to each other unless there's some kind of hindrance. So unless the substituents are such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, the substituents are nitro and ester groups. Nitro is a strong electron withdrawing group. Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which arises from chirality. So if the molecule has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at the structure, the substituents are on each phenyl ring. So like, each phenyl has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So maybe the structure is symmetric. Let me imagine it. Each ring has a nitro and a ester in the para positions relative to the connecting bond. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then the entire molecule might have a center of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, then the molecule might be meso. Wait, but the substituents are on each ring. So for the molecule, each ring has nitro and ester. But are the substituents on both rings arranged in the same way, leading to an internal plane of symmetry?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the structure. The compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. So if on each ring, the nitro is at 6 (para to the connecting bond) and the ester is at 2 (ortho to the connecting bond). So for each ring, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6. So each ring has two substituents, and the other substituents are on the adjacent ring. Wait, but how does this create a chiral center?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents (nitro and ester) on each ring are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule has a center of symmetry, then it would be achiral. For example, if the ester and nitro groups are on opposite sides relative to the central bond, but arranged symmetrically.

Wait, perhaps I should
