Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The question is about determining the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth based on some given cosmological parameters. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says there's a peak at 790 nm and the flux drops significantly at wavelengths shorter than that. I remember that the peak wavelength of emitted light can indicate the temperature of the source. Oh wait, that's Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, that suggests a lower temperature compared to something peaking in the optical or UV. Wait, but quasars are supposed to be very hot, right? Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, maybe this is about redshift. Oh right! When a source is moving away from us, its emitted light is redshifted. So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, but the emitted peak (like from the accretion disk of the quasar) would be in the optical or UV. So if the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), that means the quasar is moving away, and the redshift is significant.

I think the relation is z = λ_observed / λ_emitted - 1. But I'm not sure what the emitted wavelength for a quasar's peak emission is. Well, quasars emit a lot of UV and optical light. Let's assume the rest frame peak is around, say, 550 nm (green light, around 500-550 nm is visible green). So the observed peak is 790 nm. Let me compute the redshift.

λ_emit = 550 nm (as a guess)
λ_obs = 790 nm
z = (790 / 550) - 1 = (1.436) - 1 = 0.436. So z is about 0.436. Wait, but I'm not sure if the emitted peak is 550. Maybe it's shorter, like 400 nm (violet). Let me recalculate.

If λ_emit is 400 nm, then z = (790 /400) -1 = 1
