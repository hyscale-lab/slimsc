Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The compound is one of four options. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. The NMR has several signals, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, there are some complex splitting patterns like a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. 

Starting with the IR data: a broad peak around 3000 suggests an -OH group, probably from a carboxylic acid because those have broad O-H stretches. The strong peak at 1700 is likely a carbonyl group, which fits with the carboxylic acid as well. So the compound has a COOH group.

Looking at the NMR: no vinyl hydrogens, so there are no double bonds. So structures with double bonds can be ruled out, but looking at the options, all of them seem to be saturated. Wait, the options are:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, all of these have COOH at the end, except maybe... no, all of them end with COOH except perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check. No, all options have COOH as the last part. So that's consistent with the IR.

Now, the 1H NMR has complex splitting patterns. The splitting patterns can tell us about the neighboring protons. So, let's think about the possible structures.

Looking at the structures, they all have a central part. Let's break them down:

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the central part is two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 group and another CH group.

Option B: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, it's similar but the substituents might vary.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The central CHs are connected to CH3 groups.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the substituents on the CH groups are CH3.

Wait, maybe I should draw them mentally. Let's think about each structure.

The key is the splitting in the NMR. Let's think about each structure and the possible neighboring protons.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of
