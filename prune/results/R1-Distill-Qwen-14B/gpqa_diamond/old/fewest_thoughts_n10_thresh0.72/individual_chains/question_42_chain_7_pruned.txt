Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's read it again.

So there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method. The question gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, their masses, and their albedos. All have the same albedo, which is 0.3, like Earth. I need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

Hmm. So the problem is about orbital periods and how they relate to other factors like temperature and mass. I remember Kepler's third law comes into play here, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. But wait, the problem doesn't mention the star's mass. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating things.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is given. I think the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all three planets have the same albedo, maybe I can relate their temperatures to the distance from the star.

If I take the ratio of temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is approximately 1.4, that should relate to the square roots of the inverse of their distances. Because T is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4), so T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). So, T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D^2) ]^(1/4). So if I take the ratio T1/T2, then it would be [ (L (1 - a1) / D1^2 ) / (L (1 - a2) / D2^2 ) ]^(1/4). But since a is the same for all planets, (1 - a) is the same. So T1/T2 = [ ( (1/D1²) ) / (1/D
