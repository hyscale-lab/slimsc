Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangian theory and renormalizability. Hmm, let's think this through. I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants is important to determine if a theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories are those where all the interactions have coupling constants with mass dimensions that allow the theory to have a finite number of terms in the renormalization process.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

First, let's break down each part of the Lagrangian. I know that the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because in four-dimensional spacetime, the action (which is the integral of the Lagrangian) must be dimensionless, and the integral is over four dimensions (each with mass dimension -1, considering [d^4x] = [mass]^-4). So the integrand (the Lagrangian) must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 as well. Let's look at each component in the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

The Dirac fields ψ and ψ̄ (psi bar) have mass dimension 3/2 each. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac spinor has dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, and ψ also 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they’re just matrices, so [γ_mu] = 0. The commutator [γ_mu, γ_nu] is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. Therefore, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ has the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, which is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Wait, no. Wait, because σ is a tensor built from the gamma matrices. Since it's a product of two gamma matrices (I think σ_{μν} is a product of two gammas, because it's an antisymmetric combination), the dimension should still be zero. Because each gamma is dimensionless, and σ is a combination of their products. So σ is dimensionless.

So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) = 3/2 + 3/2 (since each ψ is 3/2 and σ is 0). So 3.

Then, F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field strength tensor F^{mu nu} has mass dimension 2. Because the electromagnetic field A_mu has dimension 1 (since the covariant derivative is ∂_mu + i e A_mu, and ∂_mu has dimension 1, so A must have 1). Then F is ∂ A + ∂ A terms, so each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions: [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. Each ψ contributes 3/2, and σ is 0. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. F has 2, so the whole term without κ is 3 + 2 =5. So the entire term is [κ] +
