Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to work through it.

The problem says that from the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in our frame (the galaxy's), the ejecta is moving towards us at that speed, right? Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is the one moving. Oh wait, no, actually, the problem states that the ejecta's part is moving towards the galaxy's center. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. But from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at the same speed. That makes sense because in different frames, the objects move towards each other.

But wait, the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, so we have two reference frames here: the galaxy and the ejecta's. Time is different in each frame because of time dilation in special relativity.

Wait, but in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at a high speed. So we need to find the proper time or the time experienced by the galaxy's frame? No, wait. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during this time.

Wait, but wait. The time in the galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's because the ejecta is moving relative to the galaxy. So the elapsed time in the galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. Because time dilation causes moving clocks (from the galaxy's perspective) to tick slower. Or is it the other way around? Let me think: from the galaxy's point of view, the ejecta is moving, so the ejecta's clock runs slower. So for each second in the ejecta's frame, more seconds pass in the galaxy's frame. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, more than 50 seconds would have passed in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v (60,000 km/s) for a certain amount of time. But that time is the time in the galaxy's frame, which is longer than 50 seconds.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The problem says: 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. How much time passes in the galaxy's frame? And then use that time to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, but actually, the time experienced in each frame is different. So the time in the galaxy's frame (t) and the ejecta's frame (t') are related by the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but wait. Let me get the correct formula. The elapsed time in the galaxy's frame (t) is related to the elapsed time in the ejecta's frame (t') by t = gamma * t' + (v x)/c², but when the motion is along a straight line, and for events that are at the same position in the moving frame, the time dilation formula applies. So in this case, since the movement is directly towards each other, the events (start and end) are at the same place in the ejecta's frame, so t = gamma * t'.

So first, I need to calculate gamma.

v is given as 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's 6e4 km/s. But the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 is 0.2 times c. Because 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2.

So beta (β) is v/c = 0.2. Then gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me calculate that.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 is approximately 1.0206. So gamma is about 1.0206.

So for t' = 50 seconds, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second. The ejecta's frame sees the galaxy moving towards it at v. The galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving at v. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v for a longer time, but in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at v, so the time is t' = t / gamma.

Wait, maybe I'm getting it backward. Let me think again about time dilation. Time dilation occurs such that moving clocks run slower. So if the ejecta is moving relative to the galaxy, the galaxy observes the ejecta's clock to be running slower. So in the galaxy's frame, when the ejecta's clock shows t', the galaxy's clock shows t = gamma * t' .

So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's frame would have experienced t = gamma * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Ok, so in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving for about 51.03 seconds at 60,000 km/s.

So the distance traveled would be v * t.

v is 60,000 km/s, t is 51.03 s.

So distance is 60,000 * 51.03 = ?

Let me compute that: 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800.

So total is 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute more accurately.

gamma was 1.0206 approximately. Let's compute more precisely.

Compute sqrt(0.96): 0.96 is 96/100. Let me compute sqrt(96) = approx 9.798, so sqrt(0.96) = 0.9798.

gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So t = 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03 seconds.

Then distance is v * t = 60,000 * 51.03.

60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800.

So 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

Wait, our calculation gives approximately 3,061,800 km. So the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute beta squared: (0.2)^2 is 0.04.

1 - beta^2 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10.

sqrt(96) = 9.798 (approximately).

But perhaps more accurately, sqrt(96) is 9.797958971.

So 1/sqrt(96) = 1 / 9.797958971 ≈ 0.10206.

Wait, no, wait. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96) = approx 1.0206.

Wait, perhaps using more precise calculation.

Alternatively, using a calculator, 1/sqrt(0.96) is approximately 1.0206207.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206207.

So t = 50 * 1.0206207 = 51.031035 seconds.

Distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.031035 s = ?

Let me compute 60,000 * 51.031035.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.031035 = 60,000 * 1 = 60,000; 60,000 * 0.031035 = 1,862.1.

So 60,000 + 1,862.1 = 61,862.1.

So total distance is 3,000,000 + 61,862.1 = 3,061,862.1 km.

But the options are in multiples of 1e6 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. So our calculated value is 3,061,862, which is 3.061862e6 km. The option D is 3.06e6 km.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame, but no, the question says 'what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame'.

Wait, but maybe the calculation is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, the movement is in opposite frames. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame? As per time dilation, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03 seconds.

So distance in galaxy frame is v * t, which is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 3,061,800 km.

But looking again at the options, D is 3,060,000, which is 3.06e6, which is a bit less than our calculation. Hmm.

Wait another approach: perhaps we should use the velocity addition formula for length contraction? No, the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, so the time is the time in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the proper time. Wait, proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end) happen at the same place. But in this case, the start and end are two different points in the galaxy's frame, so proper time isn't directly applicable.

Hmm, I think the initial approach was correct. So the distance should be approximately 3,061,800 km, which is closest to option D.

Wait, but another way: perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with non-relativistic mechanics. Because 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (since c is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is 0.2c). So relativistic effects are significant. So we can't ignore relativity here.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects using the time dilation formula's reverse. Oh wait, if the ejecta's frame shows t' = 50 s, the galaxy frame will see t = gamma * t' ≈51.03 s, so distance is v*t =6e4 * 51.03 = about 3.0618e6 km, which is 3,061,800 km, which is 3,060,000 km when rounded to the nearest 1e4. So the option D is 3,060,000, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at v. So the distance the galaxy travels towards the ejecta is v * t' in the ejecta's frame. But wait, that's a different approach. Let me think.

Wait, but the question specifies the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v for a longer period of time t. And t is longer than 50s.

Wait, so the correct calculation is to find t = gamma * t', then compute v*t.

So I think our initial approach is correct. So the distance should be 3,061,800 km, which is option D (3,060,000 km).

Wait, the options are precise. Let me see the option D: 3,060,000 km. So within about 1.8 thousand km. Close enough, perhaps the problem expects an approximate answer.

Thus, the correct answer should be option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame. The ejecta is moving at a speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) relative to the Galaxy, and we need to account for relativistic time dilation.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Time in Both Frames**:  
   Using the time dilation formula in special relativity, the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) by:
   \[
   t = \gamma \cdot t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \) and \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \). Given \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{60,000}{300,000} = 0.2, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206.
   \]

2. **Calculate Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   Substituting \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) into the formula:
   \[
   t = \gamma \cdot t' = 1.0206 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
   \]

3. **Calculate Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:
   \[
   d = v \cdot t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \cdot 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

4. **Match with Options**:  
   Among the given options, the closest value to \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \) is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which corresponds to option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).
