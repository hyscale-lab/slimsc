Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A to D, with numbers 4, 8, 6, 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Oh right, metathesis is when the catalyst breaks and reforms double bonds, essentially rearranging the substituents. So in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure to visualize it better.

3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, let's count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon of the chain. Let me number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now adding a methyl group on the third carbon: so the third carbon is the middle one. So, structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, wait, wait. Let me recheck. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Now, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on the third carbon of the pentene chain. So the
