Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what each reaction is doing and what the products might be.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that formula can be either propene or cyclopropane. But the first reaction is bromination with CCl4. Oh wait, that's a typical condition for an addition reaction, probably with alkenes. So if A is propene, then bromination would be an addition of HBr or maybe Br2. Wait, no, when alkenes react with Br2 in CCl4, it's a dibromination adding across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane, which would be compound B.

Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's a typical condition for elimination. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, treating it with alcoholic KOH would lead to elimination of HBr, forming an alkene. Which alkene? Since the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, the elimination would form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, wait, 1,2-dibromopropane would eliminate to form propene, specifically 1-propene (propene is CH2=CH2CH3, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3 if it's 1-propene, but maybe I'm getting the nomenclature wrong. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so it would become CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? Or maybe CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CH
