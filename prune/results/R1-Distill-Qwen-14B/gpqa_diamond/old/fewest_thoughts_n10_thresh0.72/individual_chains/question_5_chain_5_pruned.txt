Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that operators in quantum mechanics relate to observables, and eigenvectors represent the states where the operator has a definite value.

Wait, the operator is given in components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the overall operator P for a direction n would be a combination of these components. The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it's in the xz-plane, so its y-component is zero. So, any direction in x-z plane can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) I think, where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

The operator P is a vector operator, so along direction n, the operator would be P · n. So, P = (Px, Py, Pz) and n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So, P_n = Px*sinθ + Pz*cosθ. Wait, no, actually, no—wait, n is a unit vector. So, P along n is the dot product of the vector operator P and the direction vector n. So, P_n = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z.

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, P_n = (P_x * n_x) + (P_z * n_z). So, substituting the expressions for Px and Pz.

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So, n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So, P_n becomes (ħ/2) [ sinθ * X + cosθ * Z ].

So, let me write that out. The matrix for P_n would be (ħ/2) multiplied by ( sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]
