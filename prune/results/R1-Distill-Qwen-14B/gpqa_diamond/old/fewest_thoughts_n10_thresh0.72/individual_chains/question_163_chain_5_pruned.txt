Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and figuring out how much acid is needed and the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, let's see.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. When you add a strong acid to it, the acid should react with the base. The reaction would be between Fe(OH)3 and the acid, H+ ions, I think. So the general reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Right, since Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, each reacting with an H+.

The problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how many moles that is. The formula weight of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles, or 9.36e-4 mol.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ (from the acid), so the H+ needed is 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid provided is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule, so since it's strong, it fully dissociates. So the concentration is 0.1 mol per liter. Wait, wait, the volume we need is the minimum to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, so we need the moles of H+ needed divided by the concentration of the acid.

So moles H+ needed = 0.002808 mol. Volume of acid = moles / Molarity = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm3, which is close. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. Does that mean the solution after adding the acid and dissolving Fe(OH)3 is 100 cm³? Or is the 100 cm³ the initial volume before adding acid? Hmm, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

The question: dissolve 0
