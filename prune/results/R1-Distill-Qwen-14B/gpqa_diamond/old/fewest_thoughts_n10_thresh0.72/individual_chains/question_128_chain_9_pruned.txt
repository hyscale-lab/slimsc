Okay, so I've just started my new job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence, and I need to choose the correct plasmid from four options (A, B, C, D). Each plasmid has a different sequence, and I have to figure out which one will produce the correct P53 protein.

Hmm, I remember that when working with plasmids for protein expression, especially in E. coli, the sequences often include a promoter, the gene of interest, and a terminator. Also, the plasmid should have a start codon (ATG) and the correct reading frame. Since E. coli uses its own machinery, the plasmid should be in the correct orientation with the right ribosome binding site (RBS), maybe a Kozak sequence, but I'm not sure if that's critical here.

Looking at the problem, the P53 protein's amino acid sequence starts with Met (M), which is encoded by ATG. So the DNA sequence should begin with ATG. I need to check each option to see how they start.

Wait, the options are all DNA sequences starting with ATGGAGGAG... Oh, right, the sequences are in uppercase letters, which usually means they're given as DNA sequences. So I should look for the presence of ATG as the start codon, followed by the correct reading frame to match the amino acid sequence.

The amino acid sequence starts with MEEPQSDPSVEPPL... Let me think about how that translates into DNA. The amino acids are read from the mRNA, which is synthesized from the DNA template. Since DNA is double-stranded, the plasmid's sequence should be the coding strand (same as mRNA except T for U).

So the first part of the DNA should be ATG GAG GAG CCG AGT... Wait, the amino acid sequence starts with Met (M), which is ATG. The next amino acid is Glu (E), which is GAG. Let me check the options.

Option A starts with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA... So the first few nucleotides are ATG GAG GAG CCG ... which would correspond to the amino acids Met-Glu-Glu-... That matches the given amino acid sequence, which starts with MEEP. Wait, the first E is encoded by GAG, the second E also by GAG. So the DNA sequence starts with ATG GAG GAG, which would code for Met-Glu-Glu. So that's correct.

But wait, the given amino acid sequence starts with MEEP. Let me break it down. The first three bases are ATG (Met). The next three should be the second amino acid. The second amino acid is E (Glu), which is GAG. So the next three nucleotides after ATG would be GAG. Let me check the options.

Looking at each option's start:

Option A: ATG GAG GAG CCG AGT AGA TCT CTC... So the first codon is ATG (Met), second is GAG (Glu), third is GAG (Glu). So the first three amino acids are Met, Glu, Glu. The given sequence starts with MEEP => Met, Glu, Pro. Wait, no, the given sequence is MEEP, so first is Met, second is Glu, third is Pro. Oh wait, wait. The third nucleotide triplet is CCG for Pro? Let me see: GAG is Glu, then CAG is Gln, but wait. Hmm, no—I think I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the first three codons in the DNA are ATG (1-3), then next 3 are GAG (4-6), then CCG (7-9). So:

ATG -> Met (correct)
GAG -> Glu (correct, second amino acid)
CCG -> Pro (third amino acid). So the amino acids would be Met-Glu-Pro. But the given sequence is MEEP. No, that's Met, Glu, Pro—wait, the given sequence starts with MEEP, which would be Met, Glu, Pro? Wait no, MEEP is the first four letters: M, E, E, P. Wait no, the first four letters are M, E, E, P. So the first three letters would be M, E, E. Let me look again.

Wait, the given amino acid sequence is M
