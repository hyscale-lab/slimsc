Alright, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me see what I can figure out. Okay, the question is about a small peptidic compound that's been chemically synthesized. The NMR and LC-MS data are a bit off, so I need to find out why.

First, looking at the 1H NMR. The spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and together integrate to 1H. So, the area adds up to what's expected. Hmm, and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Wait, why does that matter? Oh, because if it were coupling with another proton, like in a vicinal diad (like two adjacent protons), you'd see splitting. But since the coupling's ruled out, it's not that. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Possibly something about the structure's symmetry or the environment of the proton. Maybe a diastereomer or enantiomer? Or perhaps some kind of isomerism that affects the proton environment but doesn't cause splitting due to coupling.

Then the LC-MS part: two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So the mass spec is consistent with the expected molecule. Wait, same mass, same spectrum. So it's not a fragment or a different isomer with a different mass. Two peaks but same m/z, same retention time? Or maybe same mass but different structures? No, the mass is same as expected, so same molecular weight.

Wait, the LC-MS is showing two peaks, same mass. So the compound is present as two separate entities of the same mass. If it were a diastereomer, they would have same molecular weight but different physical properties, so might elute at different times. Enantiomers, same molecular weight but might have same or different retention times depending on the column. But if they're in a racemic mixture, the column might not separate them if it's not chiral. So maybe the two peaks are enantiomers? But the LC-MS shows two peaks, same intensity, same mass. But how does the NMR fit in?

Wait, in the NMR, the same alpha proton is split into two peaks. If the compound is a mixture of enantiomers, then each enantiomer would have the same NMR peaks because they are mirror images and have identical environments. So in that case, the integral should just be one peak, but wait no, because each enantiomer would have the same environment for the protons, so they wouldn't split into two. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, if it's a diastereomer mix, then their NMR signals could be different. But the question says that the NMR looks consistent except for the two peaks for the same alpha proton. So maybe the molecule has some other isomerism that's causing this.

Wait, another thought. What about the possibility of a double bond? If there's a double bond that's in a position where the proton can be on either carbon, leading to cis and trans isomerism. But then in the NMR, each isomer would have different chemical shifts, possibly leading to multiple peaks. But then the integral would add up to 2H if there are two sets
