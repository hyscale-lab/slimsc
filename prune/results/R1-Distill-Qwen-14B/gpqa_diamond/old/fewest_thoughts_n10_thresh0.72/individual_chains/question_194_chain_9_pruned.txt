Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor for each state. The Boltzmann factor is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

The system has three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. So each spin has two possible states. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. I'll probably need to list all these states and calculate their energies.

The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, okay. So the energy depends on the product of each pair of spins. Let me think about each term. Since each S is ±1, their product will also be ±1. 

Wait, but the energy is negative J times the sum of these products. So each term contributes to the energy. Let me think about the possible values of each product.

For each pair (like S1S2), if the two spins are the same (+1 and +1 or -1 and -1), their product is +1. If they're different, the product is -1. So each term in the sum can contribute either +1 or -1. 

But wait, the sum of the three terms would be (number of aligned pairs) - (number of anti-aligned pairs). Let me think about how many aligned and anti-aligned pairs each state can have.

Wait no, because each term is S_i S_j. So for each pair, if the spins are the same, it's +1, else -1. The energy E is then -J multiplied by the sum of these three terms.

So the energy would be E = -J*(sum of each pair's product). Let me compute the possible values of this sum.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate E for each possible state. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

There are 8 states. Let me list them all:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
