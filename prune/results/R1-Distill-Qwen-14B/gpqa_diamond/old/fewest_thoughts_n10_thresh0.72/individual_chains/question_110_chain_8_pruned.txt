Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are spectrographs used for high-resolution spectroscopy. The key thing here is their brightness limits. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. So, the stars must have apparent V magnitudes that are brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, wait, no, the way it's phrased is "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Hmm, but wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star that's brighter (lower magnitude) is better. So for ESPRESSO, the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (because if it's brighter than 17, its magnitude is lower). Similarly for HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so apparent V less than 16.

Wait, but I need to check each star's apparent V magnitude. Let's see the stars:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent V is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d). So d is 10 pc, so log10(10)=1, so 5*1=5. So m =15.5 +5 =20.5. That's way above 17, so ESPRESSO can't see it. HIRES can't either, since 20.5>16. So Star1 is out.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So for HIRES, can it observe? HIRES can do up to 16 mag. So 16.5 is higher (fainter) than 16, so HIRES can't observe. What about ESPRESSO? ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So 16.5 is less than 17, so it's within ESPRESSO's limit. So Star2 can be observed by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So Star2 is only detectable by one, so not the answer.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5. Wait, but there's also E(B-V) = 0.6. Oh right, extinction affects the apparent magnitude. So the observed V magnitude is higher (fainter) because of dust. The absorption in V is calculated as A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So 3.1 *0.6 =1.86 mag. So the extinction makes the star appear dimmer
