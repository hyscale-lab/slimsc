Okay, so I've got this immunology question here. Let me try to parse it out slowly. Hmm, the question is about what process is taking place when certain observations are made regarding rotavirus and fluorescently tagged proteins.

Alright, first, the setup: They tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and deliver them to mice orally. So, the mice are getting this via their stomach, right? Because oral gavage means they're administering it into the stomach or the intestines.

Then, some of the fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid. Oh, wait, I remember that stomach acid is strong—like hydrochloric acid. So maybe the GFP, which is a fluorescent protein, is getting broken down, which explains why some fluorescence is lost. But some of them make it through and get entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include places like Peyer's patches, lymph nodes, and the spleen.

They observed the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cell population. So Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and they're sites where immune cells, especially B cells, congregate to respond to antigens. So the GFP-tagged proteins from the rotavirus must have gotten there.

They then sequenced the variable heavy chain gene of these cells and saw high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that something has altered the genes—like mutation. Because variable regions are crucial for recognizing different antigens.

Now, the options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

I remember that B cells undergo several processes during their activation. Let's think:

VDJ recombination is the process where the variable, diversity, and joining segments are combined to form the unique antigen-binding site during B cell development in the bone marrow. That's during the early stages, like when the B cell is first forming its receptor. So VDJ is more about initial diversity.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cell is activated, especially in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes, which increases the diversity of the B cell receptors. This helps in generating higher affinity antibodies.

Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG, etc.) without changing the antigen specificity. This involves recombination at the heavy chain locus, so the variable region remains the same. So the variability in the variable heavy chain gene doesn't fit with class switching.

Complement activation is about the complement system's role in opsonizing pathogens and causing lysis. It's a part of the innate immune response but doesn't directly cause changes in the B cell receptors' variable regions.

In this case, the B cells in the Peyer patches are proliferating, which suggests they are activated. The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene must be due to some mutation process after their activation. That sounds like somatic hypermutation, which occurs during the germinal center reaction. So the cells are likely undergoing this process to diversify their receptors and improve antigen binding.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves understanding the process occurring in B cells isolated from Peyer patches after oral delivery of GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins. The observations include fluorescence destruction by stomach acid, entanglement in intestinal mucus, and high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences of proliferating cells. High variability in the variable regions suggests a mutational process.

- **VDJ recombination** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where variable, diversity, and joining segments are combined to form the initial antigen-binding site. This does not explain the observed variability after antigen exposure.
- **Class switching recombination** changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) without altering the variable region, so it does not account for the variability in the variable heavy chain gene.
- **Complement activation** involves the complement system's role in innate immunity but does not directly affect the variable regions of B cell receptors.
- **Somatic hypermutation** is a process that occurs in germinal centers after B cell activation, introducing mutations in the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes to increase diversity and improve antigen binding. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.

Given the context of B cell proliferation in Peyer patches and the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
