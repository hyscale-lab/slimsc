Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts by talking about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Wait, dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene would form a cyclic anhydride, right? Because when two carboxylic acid groups are close, like in a cis arrangement, they can lose water to form an anhydride. The fact that it's a cis-alkene probably means the two COOH groups are on the same side, so when they lose water, the ring formed is a five-membered ring, maybe? Because five-membered rings are more stable.

Then, the anhydride has a specific NMR. In the 1H NMR, there's a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm, 7 ppm is typically aromatic or maybe something with conjugated double bonds. Wait, but it's a singlet, so no splitting. What kind of protons would that be? Maybe an aromatic ring with equivalent protons, like a para-substituted benzene. But wait, the starting material was a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So the anhydride would have a conjugated dien system? Or maybe a cyclic structure with some double bonds.

Wait, the anhydride's 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. But in an anhydride, the carbonyl would be a bit higher, maybe around 170-185 ppm. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Wait, maybe 137 is a carbon adjacent to a double bond, like a sp² hybridized carbon, such as vinyl carbons. The 165 ppm could be an ester or anhydride carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, the anhydride is formed from a cis-dicarboxylic acid. So the structure would have two ester groups connected by an oxygen bridge. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride with a double bond? Like something like succinic anhydride but with a double bond. Wait, but succinic anhydride is a five-membered ring. If the starting material has a cis-alkene, then perhaps the anhydride is a bicyclic compound or something else.

Wait, another thought. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So maybe the structure is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with the middle CH2-CH2 being a double bond, making it cis. So maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH where the CH2-CH2 is actually a CH2-CH2 with a double bond, so like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the middle being a double bond. Wait, no, that would make it a four-carbon chain with a double bond. So perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the middle two carbons being a double bond, making it cis. So, HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two middle CH2 groups. Wait, but that would make it HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that can't be a double bond because that's a single bond. Oh wait, maybe the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, that doesn't make sense because CH2-CH2 can't have a double bond. Oh, perhaps it's HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the double bond in the middle. So the structure is a diacid with a cis double bond.

When this is dehydrated, it would form an anhydride. The dehydration of a diacid with two adjacent carboxylic acid groups would typically form a cyclic anhydride. But in this case, the diacid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but with a double bond. Wait, no, the diacid must have the two carboxylic acids on adjacent carbons. So perhaps the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but that's a single bond, not a double. So maybe the diacid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but the central part is a double bond, making it HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H → dehydration would form an anhydride, but where? Alternatively, maybe the diacid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the two COOH groups are on either end of a double bond. Since it's cis, the substituents are on the same side.

Dehydrating that would form an anhydride. So, the two COOH groups would lose water to form an oxygen bridge. So maybe the structure of the anhydride is cyclic, but with a double bond still present. Wait, no, because dehydration of a diacid typically forms a cyclic anhydride without any double bonds. Or maybe the double bond is part of the anhydride ring. Hmm, perhaps the anhydride has a five-membered ring, with the double bond within the ring. So the anhydride would have a conjugated double bond, making the structure something like a five-membered ring with two oxygen bridges.

Wait, but the NMR data is more important. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, which is a singlet. That suggests equivalent protons, perhaps in a conjugated system. Maybe it's a pair of equivalent doublets that are adjacent and thus give a singlet, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, a benzene ring where all protons are equivalent, like in a para-substituted benzene. Wait, but how would that fit into the anhydride structure.

Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm peak is due to a vinyl proton, but in a symmetric environment. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride has an aromatic ring? But wait, the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene. So the diacid has a double bond, but not necessarily an aromatic ring. So perhaps the anhydride has conjugated carbonyl groups, leading to some deshielded protons.

Alternatively, the 7 ppm peak could be an aromatic ring. So maybe the anhydride incorporates an aromatic ring. But how? If the starting material is a diacid with a double bond, perhaps the anhydride is formed in such a way that a ring is formed with conjugated double bonds leading to an aromatic structure. Wait, but forming an aromatic anhydride would require a ring with conjugation, maybe a benzene ring. Hmm, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure with an aromatic ring, like phthalanhydride.

Phthalanhydride is an example of an aromatic anhydride. Its structure is a benzene ring with two ester groups attached. In that case, the protons on the benzene ring would be equivalent, leading to a singlet in the 1H NMR. But in the case of phthalanhydride, the ring would have two substituents, so the protons might be in a para arrangement, leading to a singlet. Or perhaps it's a single peak because the substituents are such that the ring's protons are all equivalent.

Wait, but phthalic anhydride is a benzene ring with two ketone-like groups (anhydride oxygens). Its 1H NMR would have a singlet for the aromatic protons if they're all equivalent. So maybe that's what we're looking at here.

So the anhydride is phthalic anhydride? Or a similar structure. Because in that case, the 1H NMR would have a singlet at around 7.8 ppm for the aromatic protons. But in the question, it's 7 ppm, which is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe it's not phthalic anhydride. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups which deshield the protons, causing them to appear upfield. But if the protons are on an aromatic ring, 7 ppm is reasonable.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. In phthalic anhydride, the carbons would include the carbonyl carbons (around 170-185 ppm), and the sp² carbons attached to the oxygen perhaps around 135-140 ppm. So 137 ppm could be the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups, and 165 could be the carbonyl carbons. Alternatively, maybe the 165 is the carbonyl. But wait, in anhydrides, the carbonyl is usually higher, like 170-185 ppm. So 165 might not be a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester or another carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the structure isn't phthalic anhydride. Let me think again. The diacid has a cis-alkene, so maybe it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in between. So HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, cis configuration. When this is dehydrated, it would form a cyclic anhydride. The structure would be a five-membered ring because the diacid is probably four carbons in a row. So the dehydration would form a ring where the two CO groups are connected by an oxygen bridge, and the middle part is a double bond.

Wait, so the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O
     \
      C-C double bond
     / 
O-C-O

Wait, perhaps the structure is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a double bond. So the ring would have four carbons in a row with one oxygen bridge. Hmm, maybe something like this:

O
||
O-C-O
     \
      C=C
     / 
O-C-O

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the ring would have the double bond as part of the ring. So a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a double bond elsewhere.

But regardless of the exact structure, the key NMR data is that there's a singlet at 7 ppm in 1H NMR and two peaks in 13C. So perhaps the singlet is from equivalent protons, maybe on the ring, and the 13C is showing the carbonyl and the adjacent carbons.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's move on to the next part.

The anhydride is reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the reagent here is a diene. The reaction is probably a Diels-Alder reaction. Because when anhydrides react with dienes, they can undergo Diels-Alder to form a six-membered ring with an oxygen bridge.

Wait, the Diels-Alder reaction typically involves a diene and a dienophile. The dienophile in this case would be the anhydride. Anhydrides are good dienophiles, especially those with electron-withdrawing groups, which the anhydride has.

So the cyclopentadiene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) would be the diene. Wait, but 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. So when it reacts with the anhydride (dienophile), it would form a new six-membered ring via [4+2] cycloaddition.

So the product would have the structure of the cyclopentadiene adding to the anhydride. The product would likely be a bicyclic compound, perhaps with an oxygen bridge from the anhydride.

The reaction would produce two products: major and minor. The molecular formula is C13H16O3. Let me check the molecular formula of the reactants.

The anhydride was made from a dicarboxylic acid. Let's think about the starting acid. Let's say the acid is HO2C-(CH2)n-CO2H, with a double bond in the chain. After dehydration, the anhydride would have the formula (HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH) losing H2O to form an anhydride, so the anhydride would have the formula HO2C-O-CO-OH? No, wait, the formula for a cyclic anhydride from HOOC-(CH2)m-COOH would be (HOOC)₂O after losing H2O. So the formula would be CnH2nO3, perhaps.

Wait, the starting diacid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond in the middle. So maybe it's HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH → dehydration would form an anhydride, which would have the formula HO2C-O-CO-OH? No, that's not right. Let me think again. The diacid would be HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond in the middle, making it HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Dehydration would form an anhydride where the two COOH groups lose a water molecule to form an oxygen bridge. So the structure would be a cyclic anhydride.

The formula of the diacid would be C4H6O4 (each COOH is -COOH, which is C2H4O2, so two would be C4H6O4, but with a double bond it's C4H6O4). The anhydride would have the formula C4H4O3. Because when two carboxylic acids lose water, the formula becomes C4H4O3.

Then, when the anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which has the formula C9H12, because cyclopentadiene is C5H6, and adding four methyl groups (each -CH3) gives C5+4= C9, and H: 6 + 4*3= 18, but wait, wait. 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: the base is cyclopentadiene (C5H6), and four methyl groups (each -CH3). So the formula is C5 + 4*1 (methyl) = C9, and H: 6 (from cyclopentadiene) + 4*3 (from methyl) = 6+12=18. So molecular formula is C9H18? Hmm, wait, no: cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each -CH2-CH3?), no, wait, each methyl is CH3. So each substitution replaces a hydrogen. So for each methyl, you add one carbon and three hydrogens, but you lose one hydrogen (the one replaced). So for each substitution, net +2 hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C9H14. Because each methyl adds 2 hydrogens. So four methyl groups add 4 * 2 = 8 H. The base cyclopentadiene is C5H6, which has 6 H. So 6 + 8 = 14 H. So formula is C9H14.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The base is cyclopentadiene: each of the 1,3 positions has a double bond. So the structure is CH2=C-CH2-CH2-C=CH2? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the structure is cyclopentadiene with double bonds at 1,3 positions. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. So 1,3-cyclopentadiene would be a conjugated diene. But with four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4.

So the formula would be C9H12? Because cyclopentadiene is C5H6, each methyl adds one C and three H, so four methyl groups add four C and twelve H. So C5 +4 = C9, H6 +12 = H18? No, that can't be right because each substitution replaces a hydrogen. So each methyl group adds (3-1) = 2 H. So four methyl groups add 4 * 2 = 8 H. So H6 +8 = H14. So the formula is C9H14.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think: the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Each of the four positions (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So the ring is five-membered: positions 1,2,3,4,5. With double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl. So each methyl is attached to a carbon in the ring. So the formula would be C9H12? Because each methyl is a CH3 group, adding 4*(CH3) = 4C and (4*3) =12 H. But the ring itself is C5H6 (since cyclopentadiene is C5H6). So total is C5 +4C = C9; H: 6 +12 (from methyl) = 18, but wait, each substitution replaces a hydrogen on the ring. So each methyl adds 3 H but removes 1 H, so net +2 H per methyl. Four methyls add 8 H. So H6 +8 = H14. So the formula is C9H14.

So when the anhydride (C4H4O3) reacts with C9H14, what's the product? The reaction is a Diels-Alder between the diene (C9H14) and the dienophile (anhydride, C4H4O3). The Diels-Alder adds them together, so the product would have molecular formula C13H16O3. Because 9 (dien) +4 (dienophile) - 2 (since two H2O are lost? Wait no, Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition, no loss of water. Oh wait, wait: the dienophile is anhydride, which is already a cyclic structure. When it reacts, the diene (dien) and dienophile (anhydride) combine without losing any molecules, so the product is C9 + C4 = C13, H:14 (dien) +4 (dienophile) = 18, but in the product, it's C13H16O3. Hmm, wait, but the dienophile has O3. So O would be 3.

Wait, wait, the dienophile is the anhydride: formula is C4H4O3. Dien is C9H14. So product is C13H18O3. But the product is given as C13H16O3. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is actually the dienophile, which is a dienophile with two ester groups. Wait, perhaps the anhydride structure is such that when it reacts, some groups are lost? Hmm, I might be getting stuck here. Let's think about the Diels-Alder reaction. The diene (four pi electrons) and the dienophile (two pi electrons) combine to form a six-membered ring. The reaction doesn't release any water or other molecules; it's just a cycloaddition. So the product's molecular formula is the sum of the diene and dienophile.

So dien: C9H14. Dienophile: C4H4O3. Sum: C13H18O3. But the product is given as C13H16O3. So discrepancy in hydrogen count. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the dien's formula.

Wait, perhaps the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's recount. The base is cyclopentadiene. Let's think about the structure:

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 have methyl groups. So the ring is five-membered, with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. Each of these positions has a methyl group. So each methyl is –CH₂–CH₃? No, each methyl is a substituent on the ring. So each position has a CH₂– group attached to a CH₃.

Wait, wait. Each methyl is a substituent on the ring. So the ring is five-membered: C5. Each methyl adds a CH3 group. So four methyl groups add four CH3 groups. So the formula would be C5 (ring) + 4*1 (from each methyl) = C9. Hydrogen: each ring carbon has two H normally. But with double bonds, some have less. Alternatively, let's think of 1,3-cyclopentadiene as having the structure CH₂=CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂=CH₂? No, that's not right because it's a five-membered ring, so perhaps it's CH₂=CH–CH₂–CH=CH–, but arranged in a ring.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the molecular formula. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The parent compound is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each -CH3) would add four carbons and four*(3 hydrogens - 1 hydrogen) = 8 hydrogens. So molecular formula: C5 +4 = C9, H6 +8 = H14. So dien is C9H14.

The dienophile is the anhydride, which is C4H4O3. So product would be C9 + C4 = C13, H14 + H4 = H18, O3. But the product is C13H16O3. So that doesn't add up. So perhaps I made a mistake in the dienophile's formula.

Wait, the dienophile is an anhydride formed from a diacid. The diacid would have been HO2C-(something)-CO2H. Let's say the diacid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H. Dehydration would form an anhydride with formula C4H4O3. So that's correct.

So if the product is C13H16O3, then the sum of the dien and dienophile must be C13H16O3. So dien is C9H14, dienophile is C4H4O3. 9+4=13, 14+4=18 H. But product is 16 H. So where's the discrepancy? Maybe in the dien's formula.

Wait, perhaps the dien is C9H12. Because 9 C, 12 H. Then 9+4=13 C, 12+4=16 H. That fits. So maybe the dien is C9H12. So why is that?

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Each methyl adds a CH3 group. Each substitution replaces a hydrogen on the ring. So the base is cyclopentadiene, C5H6. Each methyl adds one C and two H (since one H is lost). Four methyls: 4 C, 8 H. So base is C5H6 → C9H14. But if the base is C5H8? No, because cyclopentadiene (1,3) would have two double bonds, making it C5H6. Hmm, perhaps the dien's formula is C9H12. So that when it reacts with C4H4O3, the product is C13H16O3. So perhaps the dien is C9H12.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the products. The products are two: major and minor. Both have the same formula, so they must be diastereomers. The major product is probably the endo product, as Diels-Alder tends to favor endo transition states.

The NOESY NMR data says that the major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. NOESY detects through-space interactions, so if two protons are close in space, not necessarily bonded, they'll show a cross-peak.

So in the major product, certain protons are close, but in the minor, they are not. So the major product probably has a particular spatial arrangement where two protons are near each other, perhaps on adjacent carbons or on different rings.

Looking at the options, the question is about which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the major product.

The options are:

A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm

B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm

C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm

D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm

In the major product, the cross-peak is present. This suggests that two protons are close in space, likely in a diastereomeric arrangement where the spatial proximity is higher.

If the product is a bicyclic structure, perhaps the endo product causes certain protons to be on the same face, leading to NOE interactions.

Looking at the options, option B and C have singlets, which suggests that the protons are equivalent and perhaps on the same carbon or in symmetric positions.

Option A: 6H singlet at 1 ppm (maybe methyl groups) and 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm. Could these be near each other?

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet could be two methyl groups (like two CH3 groups, each 3H, but as a singlet, perhaps they are equivalent) and the 2H could be a CH2 group that's deshielded, perhaps near oxygen.

Option C: 6H singlet at 1 ppm and another 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm. So two sets of equivalent methyl groups.

Option D: 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm.

In the major product, if the endo transition state leads to a particular arrangement where a CH2 group is near a methyl group, then perhaps the 2H singlet is near the 6H singlet.

Wait, if the product is a bicyclic structure with an oxygen bridge, perhaps there's a bridgehead where some protons are near each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the minor product is the exo form, where the substituents are on the opposite side, making the proximity lower.

So, in the major product (endo), the substituents are on the same face, leading to through-space interactions between a CH2 group near a methyl group.

Looking at the options, option B has a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet. If the 6H singlet is from two equivalent methyl groups (each 3H, but as a singlet, perhaps they're in symmetric positions), and the 2H singlet is a CH2 group that's close in space to the methyl groups, then the NOE cross-peak would connect them.

So, in that case, the 6H singlet (maybe two methyl groups on adjacent carbons) and the 2H singlet (a CH2 group next to them) would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, option D has a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. But why would a 1H be close to a 2H?

Option C has two singlets of 6H each, which might be two sets of methyl groups, perhaps on opposite sides, which in the major product might not be close, but in the minor product could be.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of the Diels-Alder adduct. The adduct would have a six-membered ring with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile.

The dienophile is an anhydride, so after the reaction, the oxygen bridges would be part of the structure. The diene is tetramethyl, so the adduct would have four methyl groups attached to the ring.

But wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, so when it reacts, those methyl groups become part of the adduct.

In the Diels-Alder product, the diene would form the new six-membered ring, with substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride part) at positions 1 and 4 of the new ring.

So the product would have an oxygen bridge between two carbons, and four methyl groups attached at specific positions.

If the major product is the endo form, the substituents (like the oxygen bridge) are on the same face as the diene's substituents, leading to possible proximity between certain groups.

So, in the structure, perhaps there's a bridge where the oxygen is, and some methyl groups are close to each other.

In the major product, the cross-peak indicates that two protons are in close proximity.

Looking back at the options, option B has a 6H singlet (maybe two methyl groups) and a 2H singlet. If the 2H singlet is a CH2 group adjacent to the methyl groups, the NOE would show a cross-peak between the CH2 and the methyl protons.

Alternatively, option D has a 1H doublet and 2H singlet. Maybe a vinyl proton near a CH2 group.

Wait, but the options are about which resonances are connected.

So, the question is, which two groups are close enough to show an NOE effect.

So, in the major product, perhaps the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons near a CH2 group that's part of the oxygen bridge. So the CH2 group's protons would be near the methyl protons, leading to an NOE.

So for option B, the 6H singlet (two CH3 groups) and the 2H singlet (a CH2 group) would be near each other.

In the major product, the endo transition state would have the substituents (like the oxygen bridge) on the same face as the diene's substituents, making the CH2 group near the methyl groups.

In the minor product (exo), the substituents would be on opposite faces, making the CH2 and CH3 groups farther apart, so no NOE.

So the cross-peak in the NOESY would be between the 6H singlet (two methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (a CH2 group).

Looking at the options, option B matches: a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (maybe the methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (possible CH2 next to oxygen, hence deshielded, higher ppm).

Alternatively, the 2H singlet at 3.5 might be a CH2 connected to oxygen, deshielded, and the 6H are methyl groups nearby.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the 6H singlet is from two methyl groups attached to the same carbon, but that's unlikely as that would be a 6H singlet, which could be two CH3 groups on the same carbon (like neopentyl groups), but that's not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from two equivalent CH3 groups on adjacent carbons, and the 2H singlet from a CH2 group on another adjacent carbon, making them close in space.

So the major product has these groups close, leading to the cross-peak.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option B: a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.


The problem involves the reaction of a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene, which is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products (major and minor) with the molecular formula C13H16O3. The major product exhibits a cross-peak in its 2D NOESY NMR spectrum, while the minor product does not. The task is to determine which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene dehydrates to form a cyclic anhydride. The 1H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating equivalent protons, likely in a conjugated system such as an aromatic ring or a symmetric environment. The 13C NMR spectrum shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm, consistent with sp² carbons and a carbonyl group, respectively.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene as the diene. The reaction forms a bicyclic product with an oxygen bridge. The major product likely adopts the endo configuration, where substituents are on the same face of the ring, facilitating spatial proximity between certain protons.

3. **NOESY NMR Data**:  
   The cross-peak in the major product indicates through-space interactions between two protons. In the endo product, specific protons are spatially close due to the stereochemical arrangement, whereas in the exo product, these protons are farther apart, resulting in weaker or no interaction.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (likely methyl groups) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This combination does not align well with the expected spatial proximity in the major product.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (likely two equivalent methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (likely a CH₂ group near oxygen). This combination is consistent with the endo product, where the methyl groups and the CH₂ group are spatially close.  
   - **Option C**: Two 6H singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm, representing two sets of equivalent methyl groups. This does not explain the observed cross-peak, as the methyl groups are not spatially close in the major product.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This combination is less likely, as it does not account for the spatial proximity of a methyl group and a CH₂ group.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the major product corresponds to a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (two equivalent methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (a CH₂ group near oxygen). This arrangement is consistent with the endo product, where these groups are spatially close due to the stereochemical configuration.

**Answer: B**
