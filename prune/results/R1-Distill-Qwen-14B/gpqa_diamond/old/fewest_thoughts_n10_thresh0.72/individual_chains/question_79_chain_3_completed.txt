Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of its reaction product. Compound X is C11H12O. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I think that's a base, maybe used in some kind of elimination or ring-opening reaction. Oh wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, so maybe it's used for deprotonating something or inducing an elimination.

So the product's NMR data is given both for 1H and 13C. I need to figure out what the original compound was based on these. Let's think about the possible reactions. Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Epoxides can react with such bases to form alkenes. Oh, right! So if Compound X is an epoxide, treating it with a strong base might lead to ring-opening, forming a diene or an alkene.

Wait, but wait—that depends on the structure of the epoxide. If the epoxide is part of a bicyclic structure, the ring-opening could lead to a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide isn't the reactive part here. Another possibility is that the compound is a ketone or something else that could undergo elimination when treated with a strong base. But wait, the molecular formula is C11H12O. Let's see: if the product after reaction has a similar formula, it might not be elimination. Alternatively, maybe the oxygen count changes. Wait, actually, looking at the options, all are epoxides, I think. Let me check the options.

Options A, B, C, D: All have 'oxirane' in their names, which is the cyclic ether, so they are epoxides. So the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction with the base leads to some product. But wait, the product's NMR is given. Hmm, but the question is about identifying the original compound, X, not the product. So whatever product is formed from X's reaction, we have its NMR. So we have to figure out what X is based on what the product would look like.

Wait, but the product's data is given as the theoretical NMR, so perhaps the product is a diene or something else. Let me think about the reaction: epoxide + strong base. That could lead to ring-opening to form a diol, but that would require an acid workup perhaps. Alternatively, if it's a conjugated epoxide, like a styrene oxide, the base could induce an elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, in the presence of a strong base, an epoxide can undergo ring-opening via an E2 mechanism, especially if there are adjacent protons. So, if the epoxide is part of a styryl group, ring-opening might form a more substituted double bond.

Let me look at the NMR data of the product. So the 1H NMR has the following signals:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): This is a singlet, likely a methyl group attached to something that doesn't have neighboring protons. Like a CH3 connected to an electronegative atom or a ring, but the integration is 3H, so a methyl group.

- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, same integration. So maybe two methyl groups? Or perhaps it's a methylene group, but that would be 2H. So two separate methyl groups attached somewhere.

Then the aromatic region:

- δ6.75 (1H, d): A doublet, which suggests coupling with one neighboring proton.

- δ7.08 (2H, d): Two H as a doublet.

- δ7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet.

- δ7.71 (2H, d): Two H as a doublet.

So putting this together, the aromatic signals look like a para-disubstituted benzene ring. Let me see: two doublets for the aromatic protons, integrating to 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So maybe a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, where the substituents are in para positions. Let me think about how that would look.

In a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent has two protons ortho to it. So, for example, if there are two substituents (say, X and Y) in the para positions, the H adjacent to X would couple with each other. Or wait, this could be a meta substitution, but the doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons.

Alternatively, maybe the aromatic region suggests a coupling pattern of a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a coupling with another proton, like part of a vinyl group.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

- δ21.3 (1C, s): Probably a methyl group attached to something electron-withdrawing, like an oxygen or a carbonyl. Wait, 21 is a bit low for a regular CH3; more like attached to an electronegative atom.

- δ28.4 (1C, s): Another single carbon, maybe a CH group, but in a non-protonated environment. Or perhaps a CH2, but here it's a singlet, so maybe a quaternary carbon or something else.

Looking at the carbons in the aromatic region:

- 126.9 (2C, s): These could be carbons attached to substituents, like para-substituted carbons.

- 127.1 (1C, s): Another aromatic carbon, maybe part of a double bond.

- 129.1 (2C, s): Adjacent to substituents.

- 130.3 (1C, s): Another aromatic.

- 141.5 (1C, s): Probably a quaternary carbon, maybe attached to an oxygen or another substituent.

- 144.1 (1C, s): Another quaternary carbon.

- 197.7 (1C, s): That's a high value. 197 is typical for a carbonyl group. Wait, but in the product, where would that come from?

Wait, the starting material is an epoxide. If the reaction is ring-opening, maybe an elimination occurs, forming a double bond and releasing some oxygen. But the product's formula would then be C11H10O maybe? Wait, the molecular formula given is C11H12O for compound X. After ring-opening, if two H are lost (as in elimination), it would become C11H10O. But in the product's 1H NMR, the integration is 3H + 3H + 1H + 2H +1H +2H = 12 H. So the product has 12 H. Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O, which has 12 H. So perhaps no change in the number of H. Hmm, but an elimination would lose two H (like forming a double bond), but maybe the product is a diene or something else. Alternatively, maybe the oxygen count changes. Wait, if the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening to form a diol, the O would stay the same, but the structure would change.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula isn't given. So perhaps I need to focus on the NMR data.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the 197.7 is a carbonyl. So that suggests the product has a carbonyl group. How does that happen from an epoxide reaction? Epoxide ring-opening usually leads to diols or maybe some ethers, but a carbonyl would require oxidation. Oh wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening via an acid catalysis, but that doesn't fit with the base. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a structure that upon ring-opening forms a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a bicyclic system, and upon ring-opening, a carbonyl is formed. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is in a position where ring-opening leads to an elimination, forming a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, the 197.7 is a strong indication of a carbonyl. Could it be a ketone or an aldehyde? The 197 is a bit high for a regular ketone; aldehydes are around 190-210, but ketones are lower, around 210 maybe? Wait, wait, no: carbonyl groups in aldehydes are typically higher than ketones. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: Aldehydes are about 190-205 ppm, ketones around 205-220? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, I think usually aldehydes are higher, around 190-205, ketones around 205-220. Wait, but I might have this reversed. Alternatively, maybe the 197 is a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or another carbonyl group.

Wait, but if the product has a carbonyl, perhaps the starting material had a structure where ring-opening forms a carbonyl. Let me think about possible mechanisms. For example, if you have an epoxide adjacent to a carbonyl group, or perhaps if the base induces an elimination, forming a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material was a cyclopropane epoxide or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a substituted epoxide where the ring-opening forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the possible structures of the options and see what their reaction products would look like.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide (oxirane) attached to a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is a vinylbenzene. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a vinyl group attached, which is connected to the epoxide.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the epoxide is attached to a propenyl group that's substituted with a phenyl group on the same carbon as the double bond. So the structure is a epoxide where one oxygen is connected to a CH2 group, and the other oxygen is connected to a CH group with a phenyl and a double bond.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide has a methyl group and a styryl group attached, with the styryl in position 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide has a styryl group attached to the oxygen.

Wait, all options have an epoxide linked to a styryl group or something similar. Now, I need to see which of these, when treated with a strong base, would produce a product with the given NMR data.

So the product's NMR shows a carbonyl group. How could that happen? Well, maybe the epoxide ring opens in such a way that a carbonyl is formed. For example, if the epoxide is part of a diene, then ring-opening could form a conjugated dienone. Alternatively, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming a double bond and a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a dienone, which would have a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about each option:

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure is a styryl group (vinylbenzene) connected to an epoxide. So the epoxide is between two CH2 groups, perhaps. Wait, no, the structure would be O in a three-membered ring, attached to a vinyl group. So the epoxide is CH2-O-CH2 attached to a double bond. No, wait, styryl is a vinyl group attached to a benzene. So the epoxide would be O connected to two CH2 groups, but one of those CH2 is connected to the styryl.

So when treated with a strong base, the epoxide ring could open, perhaps leading to a trans-diol, but I don't think that would form a carbonyl. Alternatively, if the ring opens via elimination, maybe forming a conjugated diene. Wait, but then where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening followed by dehydration, forming a carbonyl. Let me think: If the epoxide is adjacent to a CH2 group, and upon ring-opening, a base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. But how does that lead to a carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has a methyl group adjacent to the epoxide. Upon ring-opening, that could form a carbonyl. For example, if the epoxide is between a CH2-O-CH2 group, and one of the CH2 is a CH2-CH2 group, but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, looking at the product's 13C NMR, the carbonyl is at 197.7. So it's either a ketone or an aldehyde. But an aldehyde would usually have a proton around δ 9-10 in the 1H NMR, which isn't present here. So it's more likely a ketone.

So, the product has a ketone group. How would that form from an epoxide ring-opening?

Another thought: maybe the starting material has an epoxide that, upon ring-opening, forms a carbonyl via an elimination. For instance, if the epoxide is part of a structure where ring-opening leads to the formation of a double bond and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether where the ring-opening forms a carbonyl. For example, if the epoxide is adjacent to a CH2-O- group, and upon opening, the adjacent groups form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a bicyclic epoxide, and upon ring-opening, a carbonyl is formed. I'm not exactly sure.

Let me think about each option again.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure is a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2-O- group, where one CH2 is attached to the benzene via a double bond. So the styryl group is CH2=CH-C6H4-Me. Wait, no, styryl is a vinyl group attached to the benzene. So if the epoxide is in position 2 of the styryl group, perhaps.

When this is treated with a strong base, the epoxide could open. But in such a structure, opening the epoxide might lead to a diol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl in the product. Alternatively, maybe an elimination occurs, forming a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but if the epoxide is opened to form a carbonyl, perhaps via oxidation. But the reaction is with a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the product's structure based on the NMR.

The product has a carbonyl, so maybe the structure is something like a methyl vinyl ketone or a similar structure. Alternatively, it could be a benzophenone derivative.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic protons are in a pattern that suggests a para-substituted benzene. The doublets and their integrations may imply that. Let's try to reconstruct the aromatic region.

The 1H NMR has 1H (d), 2H (d), 1H (d), 2H (d). That adds up to 6 H in the aromatic region, which makes sense for a benzene ring plus substituents.

Wait, but a benzene ring with substituents in the para position would have two sets of doublets: for example, two substituents in para, each causing the adjacent protons to be a doublet. But in that case, each substituent would have two protons adjacent, but perhaps in this case, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the aromatic ring is part of a styryl group that's adjacent to a carbonyl. So the structure could be something like a benzalacetophenone or similar.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). Maybe this indicates a para-substituted benzaldehyde. Or perhaps a substituted acetophenone.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diphenylethane with substituents.

Wait, another approach: Let's count the number of signals in the 13C NMR.

The 13C NMR has 9 signals, which suggests a high degree of symmetry or equivalent carbons.

So, 21.3 (CH3), 28.4 (maybe CH?), then five signals in the aromatic region (126.9, 127.1, 129.1, 130.3, 141.5, 144.1), and the 197.7 (carbonyl). Wait, but 141.5 and 144.1 are quaternary carbons, perhaps attached to substituents.

So, the structure likely has a benzene ring (6 carbons), a carbonyl (1), and two methyl groups (2, but two different carbons as per the 13C). So perhaps a benzophenone with substituents.

Wait, but the product's formula would be C11H12O? No, wait, the starting material is C11H12O. Wait, the product's formula isn't given, but the starting material is. Let me compute:

C11H12O → if the product is C11H10O2 (if an oxygen is added, perhaps through oxidation), but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe the product is C11H10O if two H are lost (like elimination). But without knowing the formula, perhaps I should proceed with the NMR data.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR has 12 H (3+3+1+2+1+2=10? Wait, no: 3+3=6, 1+2=3, 1+2=3 → total 12 H). So the product has 12 H. The starting material has 12 H as well. So perhaps no change in the number of H. So the reaction doesn't involve elimination, but perhaps isomerization or some rearrangement without change in H count.

Wait, but the product's 13C has a carbonyl. So perhaps the epoxide ring opened to form a carbonyl without loss of H, which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide was transformed into a carbonyl via a different mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening followed by some addition. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the 13C NMR has a quaternary carbon at 141.5 and 144.1. Those could be carbons attached to oxygen atoms, like in an epoxide, but since the product is the result after reaction, perhaps those are carbons adjacent to the carbonyl or part of a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound. But I'm not making much progress here.

Let me think about the options again.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So structure is an epoxide where one of the oxygens is connected to a styryl group.

Structure-wise, it would be O

     |
CH2-C=CHPh

Wait, no, more accurately, the epoxide is a three-membered ring with two CH2 groups and an O. One of the CH2 is attached to a styryl group, which is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-Ph? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2-O but that's not correct. Styryl is Ph-CH=CH-. So the epoxide would be between two CH2 groups, but one of them is connected to a vinyl benzene.

So, structure: the epoxide is (CH2-O-CH2) connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a benzene via a double bond. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH-O-CH2-CH2-Ph? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the epoxide is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that's not correct because the styryl is a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-

Wait, no, that's not it. The styryl is Ph-CH=CH- as a substituent.

Ah, wait, the correct structure of 2-styrylepoxide would be a three-membered ring with an oxygen, where one of the adjacent carbons is attached to a styryl group. So the structure is: the epoxide is a three-membered ring, where one of the carbons is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-).

So, the structure is:

O
||
C - CH2-Ph-CH=CH2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

The epoxide ring is O connected to two CH2 groups. One of the CH2 groups is connected to a benzene ring via a double bond, like Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-Ph? No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH-O-CH2-CH2 ?

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is a benzene ring attached via a CH2 group to a vinyl group, which is connected to the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps I should draw it out mentally. Structure of 2-styrylepoxide would be O connected to two CH2 groups, and one of the CH2 is connected to a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-).

Wait, I think the structure would be a three-membered epoxide ring where one of the carbons is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a benzene via a double bond. So the epoxide is O connected to CH2-CH2 groups, but one CH2 is connected to a vinyl benzene.

Hmm. When this epoxide is treated with a strong base like 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, it would likely open the ring. The base could abstract a proton adjacent to the epoxide, leading to ring-opening and formation of a double bond. So the product would have a longer conjugated system.

If the starting material is 2-styrylepoxide, the product after ring-opening would be a trans-diene. But how does that form a carbonyl group? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring-opening leads to a conjugated diene adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't an epoxide but a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the 13C NMR data again. There's a carbon at 197.7, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl. In the product, perhaps the structure is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to a benzene.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups. So two separate CH3 groups, each attached to something that doesn't split their signals. For example, two methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring or to an electronegative atom.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the 21.3 and 28.4 could be those methyl groups. 21.3 is probably a CH3 attached to an oxygen, like an OCH3, but wait, that would be around 50 ppm. So maybe a CH3 attached to a carbonyl group. For example, in acetophenone, the CH3 is around 21 ppm. So 21.3 would correspond to a CH3-C=O group. So the product has a CH3-C=O.

Then the 28.4 could be a CH2 group or another CH3. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 28.4 is a CH group attached to something else.

Putting this together, the product might be something like a diethyl ketone or a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is part of a larger structure.

Wait, let's think about the 1H NMR aromatic signals. The upfield shift at δ6.75 suggests maybe an electron-donating group attached, like an OCH3 or a methyl group. But in this case, the NMR shows two methyl groups as singlets, so perhaps they're attached to carbonyls or other groups.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is methyl vinyl ketone. But the aromatic signals don't fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with a benzene ring and a vinyl group. Let's think of something like acetophenone with substituents.

Wait, let me think about the splitting in the 1H NMR. The aromatic region shows four signals: two doublets (each 1H and 2H). That could be a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, where each substituent is a group that causes the adjacent protons to be split into doublets.

For example, if the benzene has two substituents in para positions, such as two methyl groups, but that wouldn't explain the doublets. Alternatively, substituents with different groups.

Alternatively, the benzene could be part of a di-substituted structure where each substituent is at the para position and has adjacent protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like 4-methylacetophenone. But that would have a methyl group and a ketone group in the para positions. The aromatic protons would then be in two sets of doublets.

Wait, in 4-methylacetophenone, the aromatic protons would be ortho to the methyl and meta to the ketone. So the ortho protons (to the methyl) would be two, each as a doublet. Similarly, the meta protons (to the ketone) would be two, each as a doublet. But in the given NMR, the integrations are 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, each causing their own doublets.

Wait, another possibility: the product has two substituents on the benzene ring, each causing their own set of doublets. For example, a methyl group and a carbonyl group in the para positions. So the aromatic protons would be in four groups: two ortho to the methyl (each as a doublet due to coupling), and two ortho to the carbonyl (each as a doublet).

Wait, but in that case, the aromatic H would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. But the given data has two doublets integrating to 1H each and two to 2H each. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a benzene ring with two substituents, each in the para positions, but one substituent is a vinyl group leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the product has a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another substituent that's a vinyl group. For example, the structure could be a benzene ring with a ketone group and a vinyl group in the para positions.

In that case, the aromatic H would be as follows:

- The H adjacent to the ketone would be deshielded and appear downfield. They would be a pair of doublets (each H coupling with the other), integrating to 2H.

- The H adjacent to the vinyl group would be perhaps less deshielded, appearing upfield, also as a pair of doublets, integrating to 2H.

But in the given NMR, the aromatic H are 1H (d), 2H (d), 1H (d), 2H (d). So maybe two different substituents, each causing their own set of doublets.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the coupling constants. The H at δ6.75 (d) and δ7.68 (d) could be a pair of H that are coupled with each other, with a coupling constant J around 8-9 Hz. The H at δ7.08 (d, 2H) and δ7.71 (d, 2H) could be another pair, perhaps part of a conjugated system.

If the structure is something like a benzalacetophenone (Ph-C(=O)-R), then the aromatic ring would have substituents leading to these types of signals. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again, especially the structures of each and what their reaction products would be.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: The epoxide is at the end of a 4-methylstyryl group. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2- with a methyl group on the benzene ring at the para position.

Wait, no, styryl is a vinyl group attached to benzene. So 4-methylstyryl would be Ph-CH2-CH2-O, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Styryl is Ph-CH=CH-. So 4-methylstyryl would be Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait. 4-methylstyryl is a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at the para position, and a methyl group also attached at the para position? No, that's not correct.

Wait, 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at the para position relative to a methyl group. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2- where the benzene has a methyl group at position 4 and a vinyl group at position 1? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane would have the epoxide connected to the CH2 group of a vinyl benzene that has a methyl group at the para position.

When this is treated with a strong base, the epoxide would open, perhaps leading to a diol or forming a double bond.

But how would that lead to a product with a carbonyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces an elimination, forming a double bond and releasing an oxygen. But I'm not sure.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Structure: The epoxide is connected to a propenyl group, which is substituted with a phenyl group on the same carbon as the double bond. So the structure is O-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Wait, no, 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(Ph)-CH2-.

So the structure is O connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 group. Hmm, not sure. When treated with a strong base, this epoxide may open, perhaps leading to the formation of a double bond.

But I'm not seeing how that would form a carbonyl.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Structure: The epoxide has a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So the structure would be O connected to CH2 and CH groups, where the CH has a styryl group attached.

Upon ring-opening with a base, perhaps the methyl group would be adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, think: if the epoxide is between two CH groups, one with a methyl and the other with a styryl group. When the base abstracts a proton beta to the epoxide, the ring opens, and a double bond forms. If the double bond forms between the methyl and styryl groups, perhaps a conjugated diene forms. Alternatively, if the ring opens to form a carbonyl, maybe the methyl group becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, if the epoxide is between a CH2 and a CH group (with a styryl), upon ring-opening, if the CH2 loses a proton, the epoxide opens, and perhaps a carbonyl forms from the CH group. For example, if the CH group becomes a carbonyl, the structure would have a ketone group.

That would explain the 197.7 ppm in the 13C NMR.

So, if the epoxide is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, upon ring-opening, the methyl group (CH3) is on one side, and the styryl group is on the other. If the epoxide opens with the base abstracting a proton from the CH3 side, leading to the formation of a double bond. But how would that form a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-opening leads to the formation of a carbonyl via elimination. Wait, if the epoxide is CH2-O-CH(Styryl), and the base abstracts a proton from the CH group, leading to the formation of a double bond and a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, causing the ring to open and form a double bond. If the adjacent group is a CH2 group, forming a double bond would lead to a vinyl group. But how does that form a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-opening involves the formation of a carbonyl via keto-enol tautomerism, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another idea: The epoxide is part of a structure where upon ring-opening, the adjacent groups form a ketone. For example, if the epoxide is between a CH2 and a CH group, and the CH group has a substituent that can form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, option C is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH(Styryl)

Wait, more accurately, it's a three-membered ring with two carbons. One carbon is attached to a methyl group, and the other to a styryl group.

So, upon treatment with a strong base, the epoxide would open. The base could abstract a proton from the CH3 group, leading to the opening of the epoxide and the formation of a double bond. But where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, perhaps the ring-opening leads to the formation of a carbonyl via a hydride shift or some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the base-induced ring-opening leads to the formation of a carbonyl group through elimination. For example, if the structure is such that when the epoxide opens, a neighboring group can form a double bond and a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the product's 13C NMR again. The carbonyl is at 197.7, which suggests a ketone. The 141.5 and 144.1 are quaternary carbons, possibly sp2 hybridized. The 127.1 and 129.1 are also sp2 carbons.

So the product likely has a ketone and a benzene ring with some substituents. Also, the two methyl groups in the 1H NMR (singlets) would correspond to the 21.3 and 28.4 carbons in the 13C.

If the product is a methyl ketone with a benzene ring, perhaps something like isopropyl benzene with a ketone group.

Wait, another thought: The product's 1H NMR shows two separate methyl groups as singlets. So perhaps the product is a di-substituted benzene with a ketone and a methyl group in the para positions. So, 4-methylacetophenone.

Structure: Ph-C(=O)-CH3.

In this structure, the aromatic protons would be as follows: the two H ortho to the ketone would be more deshielded and appear downfield as a doublet. The two H ortho to the methyl would be less deshielded and appear upfield as a doublet. Additionally, the two H meta to both groups would be another set of doublets, but in this case, perhaps they are not present because the substituents are in para positions.

Wait, but 4-methylacetophenone would have a structure where the benzene ring has a ketone group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4.

The aromatic H would then be two sets of doublets: the ortho to the ketone (positions 2 and 6) and the ortho to the methyl (positions 3 and 5).

In the 1H NMR, the ortho to the ketone would be more deshielded, appearing around δ7.7-8.0. The ortho to the methyl would be around δ7.0-7.3. But in the given data, the aromatic signals are at δ6.75, 7.08, 7.68, and 7.71. So that fits a little better with 4-methylacetophenone.

Wait, but 4-methylacetophenone would have two sets of two H, each as a doublet, integrating to 2H each. But the given data has 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not 4-methylacetophenone but something else, like a vinyl ketone.

Another possibility: The product is a benzene ring with a ketone group and a vinyl group in the para positions. So, structure: Ph-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-Ph. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, Ph-C(=O)-CH=CH2.

Wait, that might not fit the data. Let's think again.

In the product's 1H NMR, the two singlets for methyl groups suggest that these are attached to something that doesn't split their signals. So, perhaps a carbonyl group and another group, like an aromatic ring.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows two carbons at 21.3 and 28.4. 21.3 is likely a CH3 attached to a carbonyl (like acetophenone's methyl). 28.4 could be a CH2 group or another CH3 attached to something else.

So, if the product is a methyl ketone attached to a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group, perhaps leading to the aromatic signals.

Let me try to sketch this out. The product has:

- A benzene ring with a ketone group and a substituent that's a vinyl group.

- Two methyl groups: one attached to the ketone (21.3), and another perhaps attached to the vinyl group.

But the 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups. So, maybe a dimethyl group somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is dimethyl something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The 1H NMR shows 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). Let me arrange these in order.

Assuming the downfield shifts are due to being next to an electron-withdrawing group (like a ketone), the 7.71 (d, 2H) and 7.68 (d) could be the H adjacent to the ketone. The 7.08 (d, 2H) and 6.75 (d) could be H adjacent to another group, like a methyl.

But wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene with a ketone and a methyl group, the H ortho to the ketone would be more downfield. So, for example, in 4-methylacetophenone, the H at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to ketone) would be more downfield, say around δ7.8, but the given data doesn't have that high.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the meta positions, leading to different coupling patterns.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: An epoxide where one of the oxygen's adjacent carbons is attached to a styryl group.

When treated with a strong base, the epoxide would open. The base could deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the epoxide, leading to ring-opening and the formation of a double bond. But how would that form a carbonyl group?

Wait, another possibility: The reaction leads to the formation of a conjugated dienone. For example, if the starting material is a di-substituted epoxide, and upon ring-opening, a conjugated diene with a ketone forms.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that, upon ring-opening, forms a carbonyl group through oxidation, but the reaction conditions don't suggest oxidation.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it differently. Each option is an epoxide. When treated with a base, the epoxide opens to form a diol or a conjugated diene, depending on the structure and the base's strength.

The product's NMR shows a carbonyl group, which suggests that the reaction must form a carbonyl. So perhaps the ring-opening forms a carbonyl via elimination.

Wait, maybe the epoxide is part of a structure where ring-opening leads to a carbonyl. For example, if the epoxide is between a CH2 group and a CH group with a substituent that can form a carbonyl.

In such a case, the base could abstract a proton from the CH group, leading to ring-opening and the formation of a double bond and a carbonyl.

So, if the starting material is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Structure: the epoxide is between a CH2 and a CH group, which is attached to a styryl group. So, when the base abstracts a proton from the CH group (the one with the styryl), the epoxide opens, and the CH group becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, that would make sense. The base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the ring-opening and the formation of a double bond. But in this case, the CH group becomes a carbonyl, which would explain the 197.7 ppm in the product.

So, the product would have a carbonyl group where the CH group was, and a double bond formed from the adjacent CH2.

So, the product would be something like CH2=C(Ph)-COCH3. Wait, that would be a propenyl group attached to a ketone.

But let me visualize it again. The starting material is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, so the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)-CH(Ph-CH2-CH2-)

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is O connected to two carbons: one is CH2, the other is CH attached to a styryl group.

Upon ring-opening, the base abstracts a proton from the CH group, causing the epoxide to open and form a double bond between the CH and CH2 groups, with the CH becoming a carbonyl.

So the product would be CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH3, but that doesn't have the aromatic signals.

Wait, but the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2-? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH-.

Ah, I see. So the starting material is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, which is O

     ||
CH2-C(Ph-CH=CH2)-CH3

Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct structure would have the epoxide connected to a CH2 group and a CH group, which is attached to a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-).

So when the base abstracts a proton from the CH group (adjacent to the epoxide), the epoxide opens, and the CH group becomes a carbonyl, leading to a conjugated enone structure.

So the product would be Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would have a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3.

In this structure, the aromatic signals would come from the styryl group. Let's see:

The aromatic protons would be from the benzene ring attached to the styryl group. The styryl group would have a double bond, so the H's on the benzene would be in a specific pattern.

In the product's 1H NMR, the aromatic signals are:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

This could correspond to a para-disubstituted benzene, but with substituents that lead to these specific shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a dimethyl ketone with a styryl group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, going back to the 13C NMR of the product. The quaternary carbons at 141.5 and 144.1 might be the carbons attached to the carbonyl and the benzene ring. The 197.7 is the carbonyl.

The 126.9 and 127.1 could be the carbons in the double bond (from the styryl group), and the 129.1 and 130.3 could be the benzene carbons.

Wait, another thought: the product is a benzophenone derivative with a methyl group. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but that would have an aldehyde proton which isn't present.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-methyl-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one. Structure: Ph-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that doesn't have the aromatic signals matching.

Alternatively, the product is methyl phenylpropenoate, but that's stretching it.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to summarize.

The product's NMR shows a carbonyl group and a para-disubstituted benzene. The two methyl groups as singlets suggest they are attached to something that doesn't have neighboring H, like a carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

Given that, the most likely product is a methyl ketone with a benzene ring. Among the options, option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, when treated with a strong base, would form a product with a ketone group and a styryl group.

Wait, in option C, the structure is an epoxide with a methyl and a styryl group. Upon ring-opening, the CH group becomes a carbonyl, leading to a ketone adjacent to the styryl group. The product would then be (Ph-CH=CH-)-C(=O)-CH3. That would fit the carbonyl and the aromatic signals.

In this product, the benzene ring would have a vinyl group attached, which would have specific coupling patterns. The aromatic protons would show as two doublets, perhaps.

So, the product's 1H NMR would have:

- The aromatic protons from the styryl group. The benzene ring would have two substituents: the vinyl group and the ketone.

Wait, but the product's aromatic region has four signals, which may not fit a simple styryl group. Alternatively, perhaps the product has two separate benzene rings.

Wait, perhaps the product is diphenyl ketone, but that doesn't align with the given NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a dimethyl ketone with aromatic substituents.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The product has a carbonyl, two methyl groups, and a para-substituted benzene. The most plausible starting material is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. When this epoxide is ring-opened by a strong base, it forms a ketone, which matches the 197.7 ppm signal.

So, the correct answer would be option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.


The question involves identifying Compound X (C11H12O) based on the NMR data of its reaction product with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, a strong base, at 403 K for 1 day. The reaction likely involves epoxide ring-opening, leading to a product with a carbonyl group, as indicated by the 13C NMR data (δ 197.7 ppm). The analysis of the NMR data and the reaction mechanism is as follows:

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets for methyl groups, likely attached to a carbonyl or an electronegative atom.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic protons suggesting a para-disubstituted benzene ring.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A carbonyl group, likely a ketone.
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Methyl groups, likely attached to the carbonyl and another carbon.
   - Signals in the aromatic region (126.9–144.1 ppm) suggest a benzene ring with substituents.

### Reaction Analysis:
The reaction involves a strong base, which likely induces epoxide ring-opening. This process can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group if the reaction involves elimination or rearrangement. The product’s NMR data indicates the formation of a ketone (δ 197.7 ppm) and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**  
   This compound has an epoxide attached to a 4-methylstyryl group. Upon ring-opening, it would likely form a diol or a conjugated diene, but it does not explain the formation of a carbonyl group in the product.

2. **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**  
   This compound has an epoxide attached to a propenyl group with a phenyl substituent. Ring-opening would likely form a conjugated diene or a diol, but it does not account for the carbonyl group in the product.

3. **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**  
   This compound has an epoxide between a methyl group and a styryl group. Upon treatment with a strong base, the epoxide can open, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group via elimination. This aligns with the product’s NMR data, which shows a ketone (δ 197.7 ppm) and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.

4. **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**  
   This compound has an epoxide attached to a styryl group. Ring-opening would likely form a conjugated diene or a diol, but it does not explain the formation of a carbonyl group in the product.

### Conclusion:
The only option that explains the formation of a ketone and the para-disubstituted benzene ring in the product is **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**. The reaction with the strong base leads to epoxide ring-opening and the formation of a ketone.

**Answer: C**
