Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities to be 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Wait, but the problem says they radiate as black bodies. So yeah, that formula applies.

The question mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So, if the λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, does that mean T1 = T2? Because if λ_max is same, then yes. So both stars have the same temperature?

But wait, the radial velocities are different. Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, Star_2 has 700 km/s. But velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh, right! So the observed wavelength we use in Wien's law might have a Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength changes.

So that complicates things. Because
