Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

First, the state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Wait, phi is the phase, and alpha is the amplitude. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). Oh right, because when you have two coherent states like |alpha> and |-alpha>, their overlap (the inner product) is exp(-|alpha|^2) * something... Wait, maybe I should double-check that. The inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha> is e^{-|alpha|^2} because <alpha| -alpha> = e^{-|alpha|^2} (since coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, and their overlap when you swap the sign is e^{-|alpha|^2} multiplied by some phase maybe? Wait, no, wait: coherent states |alpha> and |beta> have <alpha|beta> = e^{-(|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2} e^{alpha* beta} }, so for beta = -alpha, that becomes e^{-|alpha|^2} * e^{-alpha^2}? Wait, let me compute it properly. 

So |alpha> is a coherent state. The inner product <alpha | -alpha> is e^{-|alpha|^2/2 - | - alpha|^2/2} * e^{ alpha * (- alpha) }, because general formula is <alpha|beta> = e^{- (|alpha|² + |beta|²)/2} e^{ alpha* beta }, right? So for beta = -alpha, this becomes e^{ -( |alpha|² + |alpha|² ) / 2 } * e^{ alpha*(-alpha) }.

Compute exponents: -(2|alpha|²)/2 = -|alpha|^2. The other exponent: alpha*(-alpha) = -alpha². So overall, <alpha| -alpha> = e^{-|alpha|^2} * e^{-alpha²} = e^{-2 alpha²}? Wait, no, wait. Wait, alpha is a complex number, but in the problem, alpha is given as a real amplitude, I think. Oh, wait, the problem states alpha is the amplitude, but the coherent state is |alpha>, which is for a complex number. But in the problem, maybe alpha is real? Because the state is |alpha> and |-alpha>, which would make sense if alpha is real. So if alpha is real, then |alpha> is a coherent state with real alpha.

So let's confirm:

<alpha | -alpha> = e^{- (|alpha|² + | -alpha |²) / 2} e^{alpha * (-alpha)}.

Since |alpha|² is the same as | - alpha |², so that's e^{- (2 |alpha|²)/2 } = e^{- |alpha|²}.

The other term is alpha * (-alpha)
