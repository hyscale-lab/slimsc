Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So this looks like a spin-Hamiltonian in some direction n. 

Wait, the Pauli matrices—each σ_i (i=x,y,z) are 2x2 matrices. The dot product with n would be σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So when you take the dot product, since n is a unit vector, it's like projecting the spin operator onto that direction.

I remember that for any spin-1/2 system, the eigenvalues of the spin component in a particular direction are ± ħ/2. But wait, the Hamiltonian here isn't just σ; it's scaled by ε and the direction is arbitrary. 

Let me think about the structure. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so H is Hermitian, which makes sense because it's an observable (Hamiltonian). The eigenvalues of a spin operator in any direction should be ± something. 

Each Pauli matrix (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) has eigenvalues ±1, right? So when you have σ · n, which is a linear combination of these, the eigenvalues would still be ±1 because the coefficients (n components) are just the direction. For example, for σ_z, the eigenvalues are ±1. So if H is ε times that, then the eigenvalues should be ε*(±1), which is ±ε.

Wait, but no, wait. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when you have σ · n, it's a matrix that acts as the spin component in the n direction. So the eigenvalues would be ±1 multiplied by something. Oh wait, the operator σ · n must have eigenvalues ±1 because each component is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues ±1, and the sum (dot product) would have the same because all the terms commute in this case, I think. Or maybe not, but in any case, the maximum eigenvalue would be when you're aligned with n, so the eigenvalues are ±1, scaled by ε, so the overall eigenvalues are ±ε.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the Pauli matrices are each
