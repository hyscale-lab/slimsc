Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Hmm, let's see. The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I remember that in two dimensions, the potential can sometimes be expressed in polar coordinates, which probably makes sense here since r and θ are given.

Wait, so the problem is about finding the energy levels of a particle in this potential. I think the general approach for such problems is to see if the potential can be expressed as a sum of terms that can be solved using known potentials. Like, maybe it's separable into radial and angular parts?

Let me break down the potential. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. Because in two dimensions, the harmonic oscillator potential is (m ω² r²)/2, but here it's (1/2)k r². So that would correspond to a harmonic oscillator with effective spring constant k.

The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, so the potential V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Combining the first two terms, (1/2 + 3/4)k r² is (5/4)k r². So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach is to separate the potential into radial and angular parts. The first term is purely radial, and the second term has an angular dependence, cos²θ. So maybe in the Hamiltonian, the potential contributes to both the radial and angular parts.

In quantum mechanics, when you have a potential that depends on
