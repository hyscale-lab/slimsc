Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which sequence of reactions would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A to D, each with a series of reagents. I need to figure out each option's pathway and see which one gives the desired product.

First, let's understand the target molecule: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, that's a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 and 5: a bromo group and a nitro group. Wait, wait, the numbering: if the ketone is at position 1, then the substituents are at 3 and 5. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone group at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. Wait, but benzene is symmetric. Let me visualize this: the ketone is attached to carbon 1, then at 3 is Br and at 5 is NO2. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is 1,3,5 positions, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, the compound is 1-substituted with a phenyl ring, so the ketone is on position 1 of ethan-1-one. So the benzene is attached to the carbonyl carbon (the '1' position of the ketone). So the benzene ring is at position 1, and the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to that point.

Wait, but in benzene rings, substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So perhaps the main substituent is the ketone group, and the bromo and nitro are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone.

So the target structure is a phenyl group attached to a ketone (acetophenone derivative), with substituents at the meta positions relative to the ketone. So the ring has a ketone group at position
