Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it's built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian. These operators are organized by their dimension, and they must respect the symmetries of the SM. But wait, do all operators in SMEFT necessarily respect all the symmetries of the SM, or only some?

I think about the symmetries in the Standard Model. The SM is a gauge theory with the gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), and it also respects Lorentz symmetry. But what about other symmetries like Poincare, CP, and CPT?

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translations. The SM is Poincare invariant because it's a relativistic theory. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which would imply they also respect Lorentz symmetry. But wait, the question says "which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT." So if all operators respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, then both 1 and 2 would be correct. But let me make sure.

Wait, no, perhaps SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that respects Lorentz symmetry, but are they necessarily respecting Poin
