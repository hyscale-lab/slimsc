Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I need to pick the correct sequence of reactions from the options given. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me draw the structure in my mind. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group, position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group. Wait, wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. That makes sense because when you have multiple substituents, the numbering should give the lowest possible numbers.

So the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Now, the starting material is benzene. I need to figure out the order of reactionsâ€”probably involving substitution or nitration.

First, I remember that benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions. Common substituents include nitro groups, alkyl groups, and ethers like ethoxy.

But wait, the substituents are in specific positions. So the order of adding substituents will determine their positions relative to each other. Because each substitution is directed by the existing substituents.

Let me think about directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors. Alkyl groups (like tert-butyl) are ortho/para directors. Ethoxy groups are also ortho/para directors because they're activating (as they're electron-donating through O). Wait, no: wait, ethoxy is an activating group because it's an ether, so it donates electrons through resonance. So it's ortho/para directing. The nitro group is deactivating and meta directing.

So the order in which substituents are added is crucial. Because each group will influence where the next group goes.
