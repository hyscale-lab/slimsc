Okay, so I'm looking at this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see. The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with specific masses and some abundance ratios.

The first part says that Star_1 has a [Si/Fe] of 0.3 dex. I remember that the notation [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms compared to the Sun's value. So [Si/Fe]_1 being 0.3 means that the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, so magnesium to silicon ratio in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times the solar ratio.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the notation right. [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, that means n_Si/n_Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that in the Sun.

And for the other elements, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So that means the iron to hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so magnesium to hydrogen in Star_2 is solar.

The question gives the solar photospheric composition as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse that. So 12 + log(nFe/nH) equals 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7, so log(nMg/nH) = -5, so nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but wait. Let me write this down:

Solar composition:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So, in the Sun, nFe = 3.16e-5 * nH, and nMg = 1e-5 * nH.

Now, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the ratio is n_Si,Star_1 / n_Si,Star_2.

Hmm, but to find that, I probably need to find n_Si for
