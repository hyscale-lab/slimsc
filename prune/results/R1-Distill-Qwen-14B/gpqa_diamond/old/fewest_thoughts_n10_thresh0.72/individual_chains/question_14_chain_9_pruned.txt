Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and the effect of different fixation methods on the peaks detected. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that ChIP-seq was done on PFA-fixed human B cells using an antibody for the IKAROS transcription factor. After sequencing, peaks were found, but when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. The question is asking where these disappearing peaks are most likely located.

First, I should remember what ChIP-seq does. It's used to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. So when you use an antibody against a transcription factor like IKAROS, you're looking for where that protein binds on the DNA.

Now, the two fixation methods mentioned are PFA (paraformaldehyde) alone and PFA with DSG (dithiothreitol). I recall that PFA is a crosslinker that fixes proteins to DNA. But why would adding DSG change the outcome?

Wait, I think DSG is used to reduce disulfide bonds. Oh right! PFA crosslinks proteins, including any that are aggregated or form multimers. DSG, being a reducing agent, breaks these disulfide bonds. So, when you use PFA+DSG, you're probably disrupting protein-protein interactions, which might dissociate some proteins from the DNA.

So without DSG, the PFA might crosslink proteins that are tightly bound, maybe as part of a larger complex. But when DSG is added, those complexes might break apart, releasing individual proteins. How does this affect ChIP?

In ChIP, the antibody targets a specific protein. If the protein is part of a larger complex, without DSG, the crosslinking might trap it, making it easier to pull down with the antibody. But with DSG, the complex dissociates, so the individual protein might not be as efficiently crosslinked, leading to less efficient precipitation. Wait, but the question says the peaks disappeared. So maybe the peaks that were detected in the PFA-only condition weren't real and were due to some artifact.

Alternatively, in some cases, proteins that are not directly bound to DNA but are part of larger complexes might get pulled down. So when you have PFA without DSG, these might stay crosslinked, leading to false peaks, but when you add DSG, those
