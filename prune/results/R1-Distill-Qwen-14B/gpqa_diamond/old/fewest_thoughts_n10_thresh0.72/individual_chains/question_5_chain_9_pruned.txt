Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a muon's operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operator components (like P here) are represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) has its own matrix form. The problem gives me each component's matrix, so I can write them out.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, but the operator P they're talking about is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, so n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, which means it makes some angle θ with the z-axis and zero angle with the y-axis. So the direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Or wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since the direction is in x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe I can just say φ=0 for simplicity. Or perhaps the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so that the vector lies in the x-z plane.

The operator P is along this direction, so the total operator is P = (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

Wait, the components: n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So,

P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
= (sinθ) (ħ/2)σ_x + (cosθ) (ħ/2)σ_z

Where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

So the matrix form
