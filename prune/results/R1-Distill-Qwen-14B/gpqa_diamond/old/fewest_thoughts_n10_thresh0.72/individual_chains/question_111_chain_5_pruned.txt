Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, A and B, and I need to find the major products for each, then choose the correct option from the four choices given. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures for products A and B.

First, let's tackle Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I think this might be a Claisen or some kind of aldol reaction, but maybe more likely a Michael addition since ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Oh wait, or maybe it's a conjugate addition because t-BuOK is a base, so it could deprotonate something.

Wait, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at position 1 (since it's -1-one). At position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl would imply that at C2, there's an ethyl and a methyl? Wait, wait: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylâ€”so position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl substituent, and position 6 has a methyl. So the ring is numbered such that the ketone is position 1. So the substituents are at 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So the ring would have three substituents: at 2 and 6, and position 1 is the ketone.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure again. The compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone has substituents at positions 2 and 6. At position 2, there's an ethyl and a methyl group. So the groups are on the same carbon, so that carbon is substituted with
