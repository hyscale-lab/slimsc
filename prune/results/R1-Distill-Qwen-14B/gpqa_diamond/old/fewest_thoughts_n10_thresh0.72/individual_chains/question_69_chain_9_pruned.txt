Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decay and resolution in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, wait. Proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So we'll probably need to calculate the Lorentz gamma factor here.

The formula for gamma is gamma = E / m, where E is the total energy of the particle and m is its rest mass. Oh right, because E = gamma * m * c², so gamma is E/(m c²), but since the units are given in GeV and GeV/c², maybe the c² cancels out.

So E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate gamma:

gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Let's say approximately 7.92.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0. So tau =7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that.

7.92 * 8 = 63.36, so 63.36e-16 s. Which is 6.336e-15 seconds. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because tau_0 is 8e-16 s, so 7.92 times that is 63.36e-16 s, which is 6.336e-15 s. Yeah.

Now, the next thing I think is about the mean path length. Because the particle is moving, it travels a certain distance before decaying. The decay length is c * tau, where c is the speed of light.

So the mean decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Wait, beta is v/c. But another way to write it is, since gamma = E/(m c²), and beta can be found from gamma.

Alternatively, beta can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta * gamma, which is (v c)/(c) ) * gamma = v gamma. Hmm, wait no, beta is v/c, so beta gamma is (v gamma)/c. Alternatively, another approach is to compute the velocity of the particle.

But maybe I should compute beta gamma as (E² - m² c^4)/(m c²), but I'm not sure. Wait, I think another approach is needed.

Alternatively, relativistic particles have beta ≈ 1 when gamma is large. Since gamma is about 8 here, beta would be sqrt(1 - (1/7.92²)). Let me compute that.
