Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the possible decay channels of this boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The Lagrangian provided is L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, actually, looking closer, the term seems a bit confusing. Oh wait, probably the interaction term is something like L = λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, the key point is that the boson X couples to fermions.

So the general idea is that X can decay into any fermion pair ff̄ where the total energy is enough to create the pair. Each fermion has its own mass, so the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion to allow that decay.

Wait, but wait. The boson's mass is 6 GeV. So I need to list all the possible fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV each, because 2m <= 6 GeV => m <=3 GeV.

Wait, wait, what's the mass of each fermion? Let me think about the standard model particles.

Quarks:
- Up (u): mass is about 2.2 MeV, negligible compared to 3 GeV.
- Down (d): similar, like 4.7 MeV.
- Strange (s): around 95 MeV.
- Charm (c): about 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV.
- Top (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV. So 2m_t is 346 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks.

Leptons:
- Electron (e-): ~0.511 MeV.
- Muon (μ-): ~105.7 MeV.
- Tau (τ-): ~1.78 GeV.
- The neutrinos are even lighter, but they are also fermions, but in the decay, you usually produce charged leptons because that's how they couple in such interactions. Also, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the Lagrangian only couples to charged leptons, or maybe to all, but I'm not sure. But for the question, I think the options include charged leptons.

So, looking at fermion masses:

Charm quark: 1.5 GeV. So twice that is 3 GeV. So X can decay into c c̄, because 2m_c = 3 GeV is exactly the limit. So that's allowed.

Bottom quark: m_b is ~4.5 GeV. 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b̄. So any option with b b̄ is incorrect.

Tau lepton: m_
