Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The problem says my colleague wrote down a "size estimate" with the expression alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) *8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order in terms of coupling constants and other factors.

I think each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of the coupling constant raised to a certain power. For example, in quantum electrodynamics (QED), a one-loop diagram would have a term proportional to alpha (the fine-structure constant), and higher loops would involve higher powers. But wait, this is a more general quantum field theory, so I need to think about how the exponents relate to the number of loops.

Looking at the given expression: alpha^3 * g^2 ... So the exponents on alpha and g might indicate the number of loops. Let me recall that each loop typically brings in a factor of the coupling constant. For a diagram with L loops, the overall coupling might be something like g^{L} or similar. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact relation. Maybe each loop contributes a factor of the coupling. So if it's, say, a three-loop diagram, you might have a factor of alpha^3 or g^3.

Wait, but the expression has alpha^3 and g^2. That's confusing. Maybe each loop contributes a different coupling? Or perhaps the couplings are different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a product of different couplings from different interactions.

Wait, another approach: the overall scaling with energy. The expression also has (Q/M)^2. I'm not sure how that relates to the number of loops. But perhaps the number of loops affects the way the diagram scales with energy scales. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I remember that the superficial degree of divergence of a Feynman diagram is given by D = dL - 2I + V, where d is spacetime dimension, L is the number of loops, I is the number of internal lines, and V is the number of vertices. But without knowing the specific diagram, that might not help
