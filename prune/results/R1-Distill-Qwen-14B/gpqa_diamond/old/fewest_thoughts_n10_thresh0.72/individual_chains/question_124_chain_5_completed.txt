Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector, and I need to find the required Lorentz factor for two-thirds of them to reach the inner walls. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the setup is that particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector. Some of these particles decay quickly and only a third reach the inner walls when the Lorentz factor is about 20. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor would be needed so that two-thirds of them reach the walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

Wait, Lorentz factor, gamma, right? Gamma is the factor by which time dilates and lengths contract in special relativity. So, when a particle is moving at a high velocity, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime. This allows it to travel further before decaying.

So, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, tau. The lab frame lifetime would be gamma multiplied by tau. The distance the particle travels is velocity times time. So, distance D = v * gamma * tau. But wait, at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is approximately the speed of light, c. So, we can approximate D ≈ c * gamma * tau.

The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they need to travel to reach the inner walls is the radius R, which is 30 meters. So, for a particle to reach the inner wall, c * gamma * tau must be at least R. Or, more accurately, the fraction that reaches the wall depends on whether their lifetime is sufficient.

Wait, but in the problem, the average is given. Initially, when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So, maybe the probability that a particle reaches the wall is related to the ratio of its lifetime to some critical value.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance they can travel is proportional to gamma. So, the fraction that reaches the wall depends on whether the product v gamma tau is greater than or equal to R.

But wait, the problem states that on average, one third reach the inner walls when gamma is 20. So, perhaps the fraction is (gamma / gamma_c), where gamma_c is the minimum gamma needed for a particle to reach the wall. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, let's model this. The maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is L = gamma * c * tau. The detector's radius R is 30 meters. So, for a particle to reach the wall, L must be at least R. So, gamma needs to be at least R/(c tau).

But in the problem, when gamma is 20, only 1/3 make it. So, perhaps the fraction is the ratio of L to R, but that might not be directly applicable.

Wait, maybe the fraction is the probability that gamma times c tau is greater than R. So, if the particles have a mean lifetime tau, but their actual decay time is a random variable, the fraction that reach the wall would be the probability that gamma tau >= t, where t is the time to reach the detector's radius.

Wait, the time to reach the detector's wall is t = R / (v). Since v ≈ c, t ≈ R/(c). So, the condition for decay is that the particle's lifetime in the lab frame, gamma tau, is greater than t. So, the probability that a particle's lifetime is longer than t is the fraction that reaches the wall.

Wait, the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that a particle decays after time t is given by 1 - e^(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma * tau.

So, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that it hasn't decayed by time t, which is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

So, the probability P that it reaches the wall is e^(-R/(gamma c tau)).

Wait, because t = R/(v) ≈ R/(c), so yes.

In the first scenario, gamma is 20, and P is 1/3. So,

1/3 = e^(-R/(20 c tau)).

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - R/(20 c tau).

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = R/(20 c tau).

So, R/(20 c tau) = ln(3).

Now, the question is, what gamma value will give us a probability P of 2/3. So,

2/3 = e^(-R/(gamma c tau)).

Taking ln of both sides:

ln(2/3) = - R/(gamma c tau).

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3/2) = R/(gamma c tau).

But from the first equation, R/(20 c tau) = ln(3). So,

R/(gamma c tau) = (ln(3)) * (20)/gamma.

Wait, substituting R/(20 c tau) = ln(3), so R/(gamma c tau) = (20/gamma) * R/(20 c tau) ) = (20/gamma) * ln(3).

So, R/(gamma c tau) = (20/gamma) * ln(3).

We have:

ln(3/2) = (20/gamma) * ln(3).

We can solve for gamma.

Let me write this as:

(20 / gamma) * ln(3) = ln(3/2).

Divide both sides by ln(3):

20 / gamma = ln(3/2) / ln(3).

Compute ln(3/2) is approx 0.4055, ln(3) is approx 1.0986.

So,

20 / gamma ≈ 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369.

So,

gamma ≈ 20 / 0.369 ≈ 54.18.

So, approximately 54. That matches option A) 54.

Wait, let me double-check.

We have the equation:

gamma = 20 * (ln(3)/ln(3/2)).

Wait, because from 20/gamma = ln(3/2)/ln(3), so gamma = 20 * [ ln(3) / ln(3/2) ].

Compute ln(3)=1.0986, ln(3/2)=0.4055.

So, 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.708.

Then, 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16. So, approximately 54. So, the answer should be option A) 54.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the equation. The probability P is when gamma is 20, P=1/3. So,

1/3 = e^{- R/(gamma_1 c tau)}.

We found that R/(gamma_1 c tau) = ln(3).

In the second case, we want P=2/3, which is e^{- R/(gamma_2 c tau)} = 2/3.

So,

R/(gamma_2 c tau) = ln(3/2).

But R/(gamma_1 c tau) = ln(3).

So,

R/(gamma_2 c tau) = (ln(3)) * (gamma_1/gamma_2).

Wait, because gamma_1 is 20, so:

ln(3/2) = (ln(3)) * (20/gamma_2).

So,

gamma_2 = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2)).

Which is the same as before.

So, that calculation gives gamma_2 ≈ 54. So, the correct answer is A) 54.


To determine the required Lorentz factor for two-thirds of the particles to reach the inner walls of the detector, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the detector's radius, and the probability of particles reaching the walls.

The probability \( P \) that a particle reaches the inner walls is given by:

\[
P = e^{-\frac{R}{\gamma c \tau}}
\]

where:
- \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the detector's radius,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Relating the given scenario
When \( \gamma = 20 \), one-third (\( P = \frac{1}{3} \)) of the particles reach the walls. Substituting into the probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = e^{-\frac{R}{20 c \tau}}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{20 c \tau}
\]

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{R}{20 c \tau}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R}{20 c \tau} = \ln(3)
\]

### Step 2: Solving for the new Lorentz factor
We now seek the Lorentz factor \( \gamma_2 \) such that \( P = \frac{2}{3} \). Substituting into the probability formula:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = e^{-\frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau}}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau}
\]

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau}
\]

From Step 1, we know \( \frac{R}{20 c \tau} = \ln(3) \). Substituting this into the equation above:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\ln(3)}{\gamma_2} \cdot 20
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]

### Step 3: Numerical computation
Using approximate values:
- \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \),
- \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \),

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.16
\]

Thus, the required Lorentz factor is approximately \( 54 \).

### Final Answer:
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is **54**.
