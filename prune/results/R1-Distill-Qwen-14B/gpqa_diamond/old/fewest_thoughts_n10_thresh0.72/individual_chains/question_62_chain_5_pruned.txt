Okay, so I've got this synthesis problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because organic chemistry can get pretty tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me draw that out in my mind. The main structure is a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl (carbaldehyde) group. Wait, no, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl... so maybe it's a cyclohexane with substituents on the same carbon?

Wait, maybe it's a bicyclic structure? Or perhaps it's a cyclohexane where one carbon has two substituents: a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, and the same carbon also has a carbonyl group? Hmm, not sure. Let me try to parse the name.

The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which would be cyclohexane with a formyl group (CHO). The substituent on carbon 1 is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a CHO group on carbon 1 and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group also on carbon 1? Or wait, no, maybe it's a branching. So carbon 1 has a methyl group which is attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group, and the same carbon has a CHO? Hmm, perhaps a more precise way to imagine would be a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons has a substituent that is a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl ring and a hydroxyl group, and that same carbon also has an aldehyde group. Wait, maybe that's impossible because a carbon can't have four substituents unless it's a quaternary carbon. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane with a substituent at position
