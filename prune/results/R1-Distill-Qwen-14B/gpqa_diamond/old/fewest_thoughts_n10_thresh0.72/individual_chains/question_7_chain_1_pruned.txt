Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and gamma-ray annihilation. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that high-energy gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The reaction is γγ → e+ e-. And the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV. The problem is asking from what energy gamma-rays their lifetimes are limited by this process. The options are all on the order of 1e4 to 1e5 GeV, which is pretty high energy.

Wait, so I think this is related to photon-photon interactions. I remember that when a high-energy gamma-ray travels through space, it can interact with background photons, like the CMB. The process is called photon-photon annihilation or pair production. The idea is that the gamma-ray's energy is so high that when it interacts with a lower-energy photon, they can produce an electron and a positron.

So the lifetime of the gamma-ray is determined by how likely this interaction is. If the probability is high enough, the gamma-ray will annihilate quickly, limiting its lifetime in the universe. So we're looking for the energy where the mean free time for this interaction becomes significant.

I think the cross-section for this process plays a big role. The cross-section σ is a measure of the probability that the interaction will occur. The formula for the photon-photon cross-section for pair production is given by something like σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2/(4E_cm^2)), where α is the fine-structure constant, and E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. But wait, I might be mixing up the exact expression. Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / (s)), where s is the Mandelstam variable s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since the CMB photons are low energy and the gamma-ray is high energy, in the lab frame where the CMB is at rest, the gamma-ray's energy E is much larger than the CMB photon energy, which is about 1e-3 eV.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The mean free path λ is the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate Γ is given by the cross-section multiplied by the photon density. So Γ = n_photon * σ * v, where v is the relative velocity. But I'm not sure about the exact expression here. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the optical depth τ, which is the number of interactions expected along a path. If τ ≈ 1, then the gamma-ray is likely to annihilate once.

The optical depth τ is given by τ = n * σ * L, where L is the length of the path. But wait, I think the mean free time is the time it takes for the photon to travel a distance equal to the mean free path. So τ = n σ c t, where c is the speed of light. So t = τ/(n
