Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them. Hmm. 

The first part says substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. Oh, and A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. I remember that fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. So maybe A1 is a fluorine compound that can act as an oxidizing agent. Decomposing into A2 and F2... Wait, when something decomposes into fluorine, perhaps it's a decomposition reaction where a fluorine compound breaks down into F2 and another compound. 

So, for example, maybe A1 is YF_n, and when it decomposes, it produces YF_m (which is A2) and F2. Let's think about known fluorine compounds. Fluorine is typically in different oxidation states in these compounds. For example, in YF3, maybe. Wait, but I'm not sure yet.

A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually unreactive, but under certain conditions, it can form compounds like XeF2, XeF4, or XeF6. So if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, it could be something like F2 itself, but F2 is an element, not a binary compound. Wait, but A1 is a binary compound, so maybe it's a higher oxidation state fluorine compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a compound that releases F2 when it decomposes.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A1 is a fluorine compound that's a superoxide or something else. Or perhaps it's a peroxide, but fluorine peroxides aren't common. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a compound that when heated, releases F2. For example, maybe it's a compound like YF4, which when heated decomposes into YF2 and F2. But then, A2 would be YF2, right? But I'm not sure. Let's think of what fluorine compounds are known.

Wait, perhaps A1 is YF3. But when does YF3 decompose? Alternatively, maybe Y is another element, like iodine or something. Wait, the problem says element Y
