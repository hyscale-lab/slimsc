Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is about five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? I remember that TTV is a method used to detect exoplanets by looking at the variations in the transit times of a planet as it passes in front of its star. Other planets in the system cause gravitational tugs that change the timing, so from that, astronomers can infer the presence of other planets. But maybe that's more background than I need for this question.

The planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, the periods are in that proportion. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. They're asking for the ratio of T4 to T2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature—right, the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it receives from its star. The formula I remember for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (R_star) / (a) )^(1/2) ), but wait, maybe that's more detailed than I need. Alternatively, I think the basic formula is T = T_earth × (P_earth / P)^0.25 × (Albedo factor)^0.25. Or wait, maybe it's inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the temperature depends on the fourth root of flux. Because the flux F is proportional to L/(4πa²), and the equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * (F/(σ))^1/4, which simplifies to T_star multiplied by (1/(a^2))^0.25, which is T_star / a^0.5. So T is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period's ratio, since the period P is related to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³, assuming the same star. So P² = (4π²/GM) * a³
