Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, the reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, the energy and momentum have to be conserved. So the initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino after decay should cancel each other out. So their magnitudes should be equal but opposite in direction. But wait, how does that help me find the kinetic energies?

Wait, the pion is a meson, and the muon is a lepton. The neutrino here is probably a neutrino, which has very little mass, almost negligible. So I think the mass of the neutrino is like zero. But I'm not 100% sure; maybe it's considered to have a rest mass in some cases, but for this problem, I'll assume it's massless.

So the rest mass of the pion is given as 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so I can approximate it as zero. So when the pion decays, it's converting its rest mass into the energy of the decay products.

The pion is initially at rest, so its total energy is just its rest energy, which is m_pi * c^2. Since c^2 is taken as 1 in these units, it's 139.6 MeV.

The decay products are the muon and the neutrino. The muon will have some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino will have only kinetic energy (since its rest mass is zero).

So, energy conservation says that the total energy before decay (139.6 MeV) equals the total energy after decay. So that's the muon's energy (E_mu) plus the neutrino's energy (E_nu). So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Momentum conservation says the vectors add to zero. So the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) equals the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). So p_mu = p_nu.

But the energies are related to their momenta via the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Again, c=1, so E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

So for the muon: E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + (105.7)^2.

For the neutrino, since m=0: E_nu^2 = p_nu^2.

But since p_mu = p_nu, let's denote p as their common magnitude. So p = p_mu = p_nu.

So now, substituting into the energy equation: E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

And from the energy equations:

E_mu^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.

E_nu^2 = p^2.

So, let me write E_nu = p, since sqrt(p^2) is p. Similarly, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2).

So the sum is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, this looks a bit tricky. I need to solve for p. Let me denote A = 105.7, and B = 139.6.

So, sqrt(p^2 + A^2) + p = B.

Let me subtract p from both sides: sqrt(p^2 + A^2) = B - p.

Then, square both sides: p^2 + A^2 = (B - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: B^2 - 2 B p + p^2.

So p^2 + A^2 = B^2 - 2 B p + p^2.

Cancel p^2 from both sides: A^2 = B^2 - 2 B p.

Rearranged: 2 B p = B^2 - A^2.

So p = (B^2 - A^2) / (2 B).

Let me plug in the numbers.

B is 139.6 MeV, A is 105.7 MeV.

Calculate B^2: 139.6^2 = let's see, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is a bit less. 139.6 * 139.6.

Wait, 139.6 is 140 - 0.4.

So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

But wait, 139.6^2 = (approx) 19488.16.

A^2 is 105.7^2. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and cross terms: 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = (105.7)^2 = 11,172.49.

So B^2 - A^2 is 19488.16 - 11,172.49 = 8315.67.

Divide by (2 * B) = 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's see, 279.2 * 29 is 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 gives 8376 -279.2=8096.8. That's too low. 29 * 279.2 is 8096.8, which is less than 8315.67. So 30 * 279.2 is 8376, which is higher than 8315.67.

Wait, 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So about 29.783? Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 /279.2 is approximately 0.783. So 29 + 0.783 = 29.783.

Wait, no. 279.2 * 0.783 is approximately 218.87. So p ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, 279.2 * 29.783? No, wait, p is 8315.67 /279.2
