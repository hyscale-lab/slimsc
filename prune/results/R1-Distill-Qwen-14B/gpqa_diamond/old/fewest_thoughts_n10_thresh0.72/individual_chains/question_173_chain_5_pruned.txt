Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle and an electron's energy uncertainty. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes I see it written with ħ, which is h/(2π), so the equation might be Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe I'm mixing up the factors. Let me double-check that.

So the problem says the electron is moving along the x-direction with speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Oh right, because the uncertainty in energy relates to the uncertainty in momentum, since energy is related to momentum for a moving particle.

Right, the kinetic energy for a non-relativistic particle is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if we can find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, we can find ΔE.

First, let's compute Δp. Using the uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). Wait, but sometimes it's presented as Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx), which would give the minimum uncertainty.

Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π)
