Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my classes. So the question is about an atomic nucleus that hasn't decayed after 50 minutes, and we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The initial probability given is 32% within 100 minutes.

Wait, radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and the key here is that the decay process is memoryless. Oh wait, that's the exponential decay model, right? So the decay probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. 

The problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait. Oh, no—wait, the next 150 minutes after the 50 that have already passed. So the total time from now would be 150 minutes, not 100. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

Wait, the question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability P(t) = 0.32 at t=100. But since it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what's the

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probability, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about an atom that hasn't decayed after 50 minutes, and we want to find the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, which is memoryless. Oh right, the decay process is a Poisson process, so the probability only depends on the time that has passed, not on when you started observing.

Wait, the question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So earlier, some experiments showed that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32% or 0.32. I think that relates to the decay constant.

I recall that the decay probability (the survival probability) is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Wait, actually, the decay probability is the chance that the atom has decayed by time t. So the probability that it has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

In the experiment, they found that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me solve for λ.

So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - (ln(0.68)) / 100.

Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately... well, ln(1)=0, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. Wait, ln(0.68) is a bit lower. Maybe around -0.3857? Let me check: e^(-0.385) is about 0.68? Let me compute 0.68: Let's see, e^(-0.4) is about 0.670
