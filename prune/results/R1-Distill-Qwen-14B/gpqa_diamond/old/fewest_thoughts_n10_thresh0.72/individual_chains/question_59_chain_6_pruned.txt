Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again and take notes. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions. Acids donate H+ ions, and bases donate OH- ions. The key is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution and see what's left after they react.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I'll calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. But wait, since it's a solution, I might need to calculate its contribution to H+ ions. But wait, in this case, since we're mixing with other acids and bases, maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- from all solutions first.

Wait, no. Let me think. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But in the presence of a strong acid (like HCl) and a strong base (like Ba(OH)2), I think it might not contribute much to the H+ concentration because the strong acid will dominate, but the base will affect the H+ from the acid. Hmm, maybe I should first calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture.

Let me calculate each solution's contribution.

First, for CH3COOH. Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it will produce some H+ and CH3COO- ions. But since it's a weak acid, perhaps I can't just add its H+ directly. Hmm, but maybe the H+ from HCl will be much stronger, so perhaps the acetic acid's contribution is negligible compared to HCl
