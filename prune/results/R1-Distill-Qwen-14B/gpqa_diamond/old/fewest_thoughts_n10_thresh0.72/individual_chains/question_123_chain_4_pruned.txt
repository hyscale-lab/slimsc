Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta and the distance it travels. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. So, the situation involves two frames: the ejecta's frame (let's call it S') and the Galaxy's frame (S). In S', the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. But in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at the same speed. Because when you switch frames, the speed is the same but direction is opposite, right? Because if frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then from S, S' is moving at v, and from S', S is moving at -v.

So, in this case, the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s towards the center. Because from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it at that speed.

Wait, but the problem states that the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So we have a time of 50 seconds in S', and we need to find the distance traveled in S.

Wait, but time in S' is different from time in S because of time dilation. Since the frames are moving relative to each other, their times will differ. Hmm, so that complicates things.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So we don't have to worry about any of that, just special relativity.

So in special relativity, when two inertial frames are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other, we can use the Lorentz transformations.

So, let's think about this. The problem is about relative motion and time dilation.

In the ejecta's frame (S'):

- The time elapsed is 50 seconds.

- The ejecta is at rest in S', so the distance it travels in S' is zero, because it's not moving in its own frame.
