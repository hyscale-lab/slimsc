Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph when used with an 8m VLT telescope. The condition is that the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel should be at least 10 after a 1-hour exposure. 

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, but I think its performance depends on the brightness of the star. Brighter stars (lower magnitude) are easier to detect because they provide more photons, which improves the S/N ratio.

The question gives me six stars labeled a to f. Each star has specific characteristics, mainly their distance and absolute magnitude. Absolute magnitude is the brightness of a star at a standard distance of 10 parsecs. So, let me think about how to calculate their apparent magnitudes because apparent magnitude is what determines their brightness as seen from Earth.

Apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d / 10), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. 

Let me calculate the apparent magnitude for each star:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a bright star. From what I remember, Canopus has an apparent magnitude around -0.7. So it's very bright. Definitely, it should be easily detectable.

b) Polaris: Polaris is the North Star. Its apparent magnitude is about 2.1. That's still bright enough, I think.

c) Star with M=15, distance=10 pc: Using the formula, m = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) = 15 + 5*0 =15. So apparent magnitude 15. That's a very faint star. I'm not sure if ESPRESSO can detect that. Maybe not, since higher magnitudes mean fainter objects.

d) Star with M=15, distance=200 pc: So d=200. Let's compute m: 15 +5*log10(200/10) =15 +5*log10(20). log10(20) is about 1.301. So 5*1.301≈6.505. So m≈15+6.505≈21.505. That's even fainter than star c. Probably not detectable.

e) Star with M=15, distance=5 pc: m=15 +5*log10(5/10) =15 +5*log10(0.5). Log10(0.5) is about -0.301, so 5*(-0.301)=-1.505. So m≈15-1.505=13.495. That's about magnitude 13.5. Hmm, what's the detectability here? I think ESPRESSO can go down to certain magnitudes.

f) Star with M=15, distance=50 pc: m=15 +5*log10(50/10)=15 +5*log10(5). Log10(5) is about 0.69897. 5 * 0.69897≈3.495. So m=15+3.495≈18.495. So about 18.5, which is even fainter than e but brighter than c and d.

Wait, I should probably think about what ESPRESSO's limiting magnitude is. From what I vaguely remember, ESPRESSO is designed for bright stars, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the exposure time and S/N.

ESPRESSO's S/N per pixel depends on the star's brightness. The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * exposure_time) / sqrt(flux). But I might be confusing it with other calculations. Alternatively, I could think about the relation between magnitude and photon count. The fainter the star (higher magnitude), the fewer photons it emits, so lower S/N.

I think ESPRESSO is optimized for bright stars, but I'm not exactly sure down to which magnitude it can reach with a 1-hour exposure. Let me try to find some approximate data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the V magnitude and how the S/N scales with it. The S/N for a star is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is a reference magnitude. For example, if a star of magnitude m0 gives S/N0 photons, then a star of magnitude m will give S/N = S/N0 * 10^(-0.4
