Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products from both reactions are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. The task is to determine the starting materials A and B based on the given options.

Hmm, I remember that reducing agents like LiBH4 and BH3 are used in different contexts. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for carbonyl groups. But BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, right? Oh wait, no, I think BH3 is used with other reagents like THF to form BH3·THF, which is the actual reagent in hydroboration-oxidation. So in this case, the two reactions are using different reducing agents, but I'm not sure exactly how they're applied here.

Wait, the products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is R configuration and the other S. So the starting materials must have been something that would form these upon reduction.

Wait, wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Wait, no, tetrahydro-pyran would be a six-membered ring with oxygen. 2H-pyran-2-one implies a lactone or a cyclic ketone? Wait, no, pyran-2-one would be a cyclic ketone with a five-membered ring? No, pyran is a six-membered ring. So pyran-2-one would have a ketone group in position 2 of a six-membered ring with oxygen in position 1. So it's a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. So how do we form a cyclic ketone from a starting material? Maybe through a ring-closing reaction or via a hemiacetal formation.

Wait, the starting materials are A and B. The reagents used are LiBH4 and BH3. Let me think about what each reagent does.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters, ketones, aldehydes, etc., to alcohols. Wait, but if the starting material is an ester, LiBH4 might not reduce it directly. Oh wait, LiBH4 can reduce esters, but maybe in the presence of something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and LiBH4 reduces it. Hmm, but the product is a ketone. That doesn't make sense because reducing a ketone would typically give an alcohol.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't a ketone but something else. Let me think about the product structure. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has six members, with the oxygen in position 1, a ketone in position 2, and an ethyl group in position 4. So the ring is similar to a tetrahydropyran ring, with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal or an acetal, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester or something that can undergo a ring-forming reaction upon reduction.

Wait, another approach: think about the stereochemistry. The products have R and S configurations. Since the starting materials are A and B, treated with different reducing agents, the stereochemistry of the starting materials determines the configuration of the product.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which follow anti-Markovnikov addition and have stereoselectivity based on the geometry of the alkene. Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone. Hmm, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reagent is opening it. But that doesn't quite fit with LiBH4.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are esters or ketones that undergo some sort of ring-forming reaction upon reduction. Wait, if the product is a cyclic ketone, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent leaving group, like an ester, which upon reduction forms the ring.

Wait, considering that LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols. For example, an ester R-O-CO-R' would be reduced to R-O-CH2-OH. But I'm not sure how that would form a ring.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are acyloxy compounds, perhaps β-keto esters. Let me think about the product. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester group is converted into a CH2OH group, leading to ring formation.

Wait, β-keto esters can undergo reduction. For example, reduction of a β-keto ester with a strong reducing agent like LiBH4 might reduce the ester to an alcohol, but the β-keto group would remain, or perhaps it would be reduced as well.

Let me think about the mechanism. If you have a β-keto ester, say, RCO-COOR', and you reduce it. LiBH4 might attack the ester group first, converting it into an alcohol. But wait, β-keto esters are more resistant to reduction because the carbonyl is adjacent to another carbonyl group, making it less reactive. Maybe in some cases, the ester can be reduced, but the ketone is more reactive. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. So, the starting material must have a structure that upon reduction forms a ring with a ketone group. Maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group or something else that can form a ring upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester. When reduced, the ester part is converted into a diol, which could form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester with a leaving group, like an ester. Let's say the structure is something like CH2-CO-O-R, where R is a substituent that allows ring formation when reduced.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reagents again. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+ (maybe acidic workup), and the second uses BH3 and H+.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are less vigorous. So perhaps LiBH4 is used to reduce an ester group, while BH3 is doing something else.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, could the starting materials be cyclic ketones with certain stereochemistry, and the reagents are causing some kind of ring-opening or reduction?

No, that doesn't seem right because the product is a cyclic ketone.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possibility of the starting materials being epoxides. When epoxides are treated with LiBH4, they can be ring-opened. But LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to open epoxides, but I'm not sure if that leads to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers with some substituents. Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Let me think about the product configuration. The R and S configurations in the product. So, the starting materials must have had the opposite configurations, leading to the products via the reducing agent's influence.

Wait, the starting materials are A and B. When A is treated with LiBH4, it becomes (R)-product. When B is treated with BH3, it becomes (S)-product.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically nonstereoselective in some reactions. BH3, in hydroboration, is stereoselective, leading to anti-Markovnikov addition with specific stereochemistry.

But how does that relate here? Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but that doesn't explain the product being a ketone.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe the starting materials are epoxides, and the reagents are opening them. LiBH4 could open epoxides, but I'm not exactly sure how that would form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal or acetal, and the reagent is reducing it. But that seems unclear.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options. The options for A and B are both 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with either R or S configuration.

Wait, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's draw this structure. The formula would be something like CH2CH2-COOH, but wait, no. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. But substituents are at position 3 (ethyl) and position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo).

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So 3-ethyl would be on the third carbon. 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo would mean that the fifth carbon (which is the COOH group?) has an isobutoxy and oxo group? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the COOH is at the end. Hmm, perhaps the structure is more like:

The molecule is five carbons in total. The carboxylic acid is at position 5. So the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-... Wait, no, let me try again. The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Pentanoic acid: CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. But substituted with an ethyl group at position 3 and an isobutoxy and oxo group at position 5.

Wait, position 3 is the third carbon from the COOH. So, the structure would be:

COOH-(CH2)_2-C-O-isobutoxy and a ketone at the same carbon?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is a pentanoic acid, meaning five carbons in the chain. The positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the chain is five carbons, with COOH at the end. So positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is actually five carbons: the COOH is carbon 1, then four more carbons? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the chain is numbered from the COOH end.

So, pentanoic acid: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's hexanoic. Wait, no. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is five carbons in total. So:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH2 (C3) - CH2 (C4) - CH3 (C5). No, that would make it butanoic acid. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me count: pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is five carbons. So numbering from the COOH end: C1 (COOH), C2 (CH2), C3 (CH2), C4 (CH2), C5 (CH3).

But in the compound 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, the substituents are at C3 and C5.

Wait, but C5 is the end (CH3), so how can it have an isobutoxy and oxo group? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the structure is:

The main chain is five carbons, with COOH at one end. The substituents are at position 3 and position 5. Wait, position 5 would be the last carbon. So, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(CH2CH3)(O-isobutyl)-CO-something? No, perhaps it's:

The correct structure is more like:

The carboxylic acid is on carbon 1. Carbon 3 has an ethyl group, and carbon 5 has both an isobutoxy (O-isobutyl) group and an oxo (keto) group.

Wait, so carbon 5 is the fifth carbon in the chain, which would be at the end. But having both isobutoxy and oxo groups on carbon 5 seems tricky because it's already a methyl group (if it's a pentanoic acid). Hmm, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a straight chain. Or perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like:

CH2-C(=O)-O-isobutyl and an ethyl group on the same carbon? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a β-keto acid. So, the structure could be:

CH2(CO2H)-CO-O-isobutyl? But that doesn't fit the description. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH2CH2-CO-O-isobutyl with an ethyl group on the adjacent carbon. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about the product again. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring is six-membered, with the oxygen in position 1. The ketone is in position 2, and an ethyl group in position 4.

So, the ring could have been formed by a five-carbon chain connecting to form a six-membered ring. Wait, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the reaction conditions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces esters to alcohols. If the starting material is a β-keto ester, LiBH4 would reduce the ester to a secondary alcohol. Then, perhaps a ring forms via hemiacetal formation.

Wait, for example, if you have a β-keto ester like CH3-CO-CO-O-R, reducing the ester would give CH3-CO-CH2-OH. Then, the β-keto group (the CO adjacent to CH2OH) could undergo intramolecular cyclization to form a ring. The hydroxyl group would attack the carbonyl carbon, forming a five-membered ring (since the chain is long enough). Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring, so perhaps the chain is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a β-keto ester. When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester to an alcohol, and the β-keto group remains. Then, under certain conditions, a cyclization could occur to form a cyclic ketone.

But how does that lead to the product being a six-membered ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a γ-keto ester, which upon reduction would form a diol, which could then cyclize to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let's imagine the structure:

Suppose the starting material is a β-keto ester, like CH2(COOR)-CO-CH2-CH2-COOH. When LiBH4 reduces the ester, it becomes CH2(CHOH)-CO-CH2-CH2-COOH. Then, perhaps the hydroxyl group could attack the ketone carbon, leading to a ring formation.

Wait, but the exact structure is a bit unclear. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the options, both A and B are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, differing only in their configuration (R or S). So the starting materials are enantiomers of each other.

When treated with LiBH4 and H+, they form (R)-product. When treated with BH3 and H+, they form (S)-product.

Wait, but in the question, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-product, and B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-product.

So, the configuration of the starting material and the reagent determine the configuration of the product.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reagent is causing the reduction in a way that affects the stereochemistry.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to racemization in some cases, but if the starting material is chiral, the reducing agent might affect the configuration.

Wait, but BH3 is a different reagent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but an epoxide opening. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of an ester. Let's say the ester is in a position that allows for ring formation upon reduction.

Wait, another thought: when a β-keto ester is reduced, the ester group is converted into a CH2OH group. Then, the β-keto group can undergo a cyclization to form a cyclic ketone. The stereochemistry of the starting material would influence the direction of the ring formation, determining the R or S configuration of the product.

Wait, let me model this. Let's say the starting material is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. When reduced with LiBH4, the ester (if that's what it is) is converted to an alcohol. Wait, but the starting material is an acid, not an ester. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the structures.

Wait, the starting material is 5-oxopentanoic acid with substituents. So, it's a β-keto acid. When reduced, the β-keto acid would convert into a secondary alcohol. But LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce the β-keto acid to the corresponding alcohol.

Wait, but β-keto acids are typically reduced to secondary alcohols. For example, if you have RCOCH2COOH, reducing it would give RCOCH2CH2OH.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reduction leads to a ring formation.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then forms a cyclic hemiacetal.

I'm starting to get a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think of the options. The options involve the starting materials being either R or S configurations.

The product from reaction A is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and reaction B gives (S)-product.

So, depending on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent used, the product's configuration is determined.

Wait, perhaps the reduction of a β-keto ester leads to the formation of a chiral center, and the configuration depends on the starting material and the reducing agent.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and is known to cause racemization because it typically involves a two-step mechanism where the intermediate is planar. So if the starting material is chiral, using LiBH4 might lead to a racemic mixture. But in this case, the product is enantiomerically pure (R or S), so that can't be the case.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but an oxidation or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reactions are ester reductions leading to diols which form rings.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl β-keto ester. When reduced with LiBH4, it becomes a diol, which can cyclize to form a cyclic hemiacetal. The stereochemistry of the starting material would dictate the configuration of the product.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the stereochemistry part.

If the starting material is (R), and upon reduction, it leads to (R) product. Similarly, (S) would lead to (S) product. So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material directly transfers to the product.

But why would the reagents matter then? Because LiBH4 and BH3 are different reagents, perhaps they affect the reaction in a way that leads to different stereochemistry.

Wait, but BH3 is usually associated with hydroboration, which is a concerted process leading to anti-Markovnikov addition and specific stereochemistry based on the alkene's geometry.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an enone (conjugated enol ether), and the reagents are performing a conjugate addition.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reactions are reductions of an epoxide. Let me think: if the starting material is an epoxide, treatment with LiBH4 could open it to form an alcohol. But how would that lead to a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an adjacent ester group. Reduction would remove the ester and form a ring.

I'm still a bit stuck.

Let me try to think of the product again. The product is a 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with an ethyl group in position 4, a ketone in position 2, and an oxygen in position 1.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
C2
|
C1-O
|
C3 - C4 (ethyl)
|
C5
|
C6

Wait, perhaps it's:

Positions 1 (O), 2 (keto), 4 (ethyl). So, the ring is O-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-O.

Wait, but that's a six-membered ring with an oxygen in position 1 and a ketone in position 2.

So, how would this form from the starting material?

If the starting material is a β-keto ester, perhaps the ester is at position 5, and the β-keto group is at position 3. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and then the β-keto group allows for cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-C(O)-O-isobutyl-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-?

Wait, I'm not getting the structure correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a β-keto acid, where the keto group is at position 3, and an ester at position 5.

Wait, no, the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, it's a pentanoic acid (five carbons) with an ethyl group on carbon 3, an isobutoxy group on carbon 5, and a ketone on carbon 5.

Wait, but carbon 5 is the last carbon (since it's pentanoic acid), so how can it have both an isobutoxy and a ketone group? That seems impossible because carbon 5 would be a methyl group (if it's pentanoic acid). So I'm probably misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Maybe the COOH is at position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5. So, position 5 would be the end. So, the structure would be:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH3) (C3) - something (C4) - C5.

But C5 can't have both isobutoxy and oxo groups. So perhaps the structure is a β-keto ester, with the ester group on C5.

Wait, but in this case, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl.

Wait, that would make sense. So, the molecule is a β-keto ester. The COOH is at C1, followed by CH2 (C2), then CH(CH2CH3) (C3), then CO (C4), and O-isobutyl (C5). So, the structure is CH2CH2-COOH with substituents? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

No, that doesn't exactly fit, but perhaps the substituents are on C3 and C5.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me move on.

Assuming the starting material is a β-keto ester, upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester group (C=O) is reduced to a CH2OH group. The β-keto group would then allow for a cyclization to form a ring. The configuration of the starting material would affect the ring's configuration.

When the starting material is treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, the ester is reduced to an alcohol. Then, the β-keto group (now a CH2OH) would form a hemiacetal with the adjacent hydroxyl group, leading to ring formation.

But the product is a ketone, so perhaps the reduction step also affects the β-keto group.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. If the starting material is a β-keto ester, reduction with LiBH4 would reduce the ester to a CH2OH group, but the β-keto group remains as a ketone. Then, the molecule could undergo a ring-forming reaction between the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl, leading to a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent but doesn't typically reduce ketones to alcohols under all conditions. Maybe in this case, the β-keto group is resistant to reduction, so only the ester is reduced.

Wait, but if the ester is reduced, the structure would have a CH2OH group, and the β-keto group would remain as a ketone. Then, the OH could attack the carbonyl, leading to a ring formation.

So, the product would be a cyclic ketone.

The configuration of the starting material would dictate the stereochemistry of the product because the reduction would create a new chiral center, and the starting material's configuration would influence the attack direction.

So, when the starting material is (R), the product is (R); when it's (S), the product is (S).

Wait, but the reagents are different. So, in one case, A is treated with LiBH4, and B is treated with BH3.

Hmm, so why would the reagent affect the stereochemistry?

Wait, maybe the reaction mechanism is different for the two reagents. LiBH4 might proceed through a certain pathway, while BH3 might proceed through a different pathway, affecting the resulting stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents affect the reduction of a different functional group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. LiBH4 could open the epoxide in a certain way, leading to a specific stereochemistry, while BH3, perhaps in a different solvent or condition, opens the epoxide differently.

But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of an ester to an alcohol, followed by a cyclization. The stereochemistry of the starting material would determine the configuration of the product.

Wait, but in that case, the reagent shouldn't affect the configuration—only the starting material's configuration would. So why would the same starting material treated with different reagents give different products?

Hmm, perhaps the reagents affect the reaction's pathway, leading to different stereochemistry.

Wait, another angle: LiBH4 is a hydride donor, and in the reduction of a ketone, it would add a hydride to the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an alcohol. The stereochemistry would depend on the approach of the hydride. But in a cyclic ketone, the ring structure would influence the approach.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an adjacent substituent. When reduced, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and the reduction forms an alcohol, which then forms the ring.

I think I'm going in circles here. Perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options provided.

The options are:

A) Both A and B are (S)-configuration
B) Both are (R)
C) A is (S), B is (R)
D) A is (R), B is (S)

The question is that A is treated with LiBH4 to give (R) product, and B is treated with BH3 to give (S) product.

So, what determines which starting material gives which product?

If the reagents affect the reaction's stereoselectivity, then perhaps the same starting material would give different products when treated with different reagents. But that's not the case here; each starting material is treated with a different reagent.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers. So, when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it gives R product. When B (S) is treated with BH3, it gives S product.

But why would the reagents not change the configuration?

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the same configuration in the product regardless of the starting material, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps the configuration of the starting material directly determines the product's configuration, regardless of the reagent. So, if the starting material is R, the product is R; if S, the product is S.

In that case, the reagents would have to be the same, but the question says they're different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents affect the configuration via their reaction mechanisms. For example, LiBH4 may lead to a certain attack direction, while BH3 leads to the opposite.

Wait, if LiBH4 causes the hydride to add from a certain face, leading to R configuration, and BH3 causes the hydride to add from the opposite face, leading to S, then the starting material's configuration would influence the product's configuration based on the reagent.

But I'm not sure if LiBH4 or BH3 would lead to such stereoselectivity in this context.

Wait, another angle: the product is a cyclic ketone, which is formed via an intramolecular aldol condensation. The starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes aldol condensation to form the ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester becomes a CH2OH, which then forms the ring via a hemiacetal with the β-keto group.

Wait, but the β-keto group would be a carbonyl, so perhaps the OH attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to ring formation.

So, the ring formation would create a new chiral center. The configuration of that center would depend on the starting material's configuration and the reagent's approach.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to make an educated guess.

The options are D) A is R and B is S.

If treating R starting material with LiBH4 gives R product, and treating S starting material with BH3 gives S product, then D would be the correct option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the configuration to invert. So, if starting with R and using LiBH4 gives R, and starting with R and using BH3 gives S. But that's not the case here.

Wait, but the question says that A is treated with LiBH4 to give R, and B is treated with BH3 to give S.

If A is R and B is S, then the starting materials are enantiomers. So, when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, gives R product, and B (S) is treated with BH3, gives S product.

That would mean option D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material is the same as the product. So, if the starting material is R, the product is R, and if it's S, product is S.

Thus, the correct starting materials would be A = R and B = S.

Looking at the options, option D is A = R, B = S.


The question involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 for reaction A and BH3 for reaction B. The starting materials are enantiomers of the compound (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid), differing in their R/S configuration.

Key points to consider:

1. **Reagents and Reaction Mechanism**:  
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces esters or ketones to alcohols.  
   - BH3 is commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which are stereoselective.  
   - The product is a cyclic ketone, suggesting that the starting material undergoes reduction and cyclization to form the ring.

2. **Stereochemistry of the Reaction**:  
   - The configuration of the starting material directly influences the stereochemistry of the product.  
   - If the starting material is (R), the product will be (R), and if the starting material is (S), the product will be (S).  
   - The reagents do not alter the configuration of the starting material but rather facilitate the reaction pathway leading to the observed stereochemistry.

3. **Analysis of the Options**:  
   - Option A: Both A and B are (S). This is incorrect because the products are enantiomers, requiring enantiomeric starting materials.  
   - Option B: Both A and B are (R). This is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.  
   - Option C: A is (S), B is (R). This is incorrect because the starting material with (S) would produce the (S) product, not the (R) product.  
   - Option D: A is (R), B is (S). This is correct because the (R) starting material with LiBH4 produces the (R) product, and the (S) starting material with BH3 produces the (S) product.

Based on the reasoning, the correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Answer: D
