Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. The problem states there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak here could mean either an alcohol (OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have a very broad and strong peak around that region. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the peak is usually broader but maybe not as strong? Hmm, not entirely sure, but I'll note that there's an O-H group present.

Then, two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is where carbonyl groups (C=O) show up. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or an amide? Or perhaps it's something else like a conjugated double bond. Wait, but the NMR part mentions vinyl hydrogens, so there's probably a double bond somewhere. Oh, but the 1650 peak could be a carbonyl group adjacent to something else. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring's stretching, but that usually is around 1450-1600. Wait, waitâ€”carbonyl groups in different environments can vary. For example, esters, ketones, aldehydes, etc., have different absorption regions. 1700 is common for esters or ketones. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester, or maybe an aromatic ring with a substituent causing the shift.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are typically in the range of about 4.5-7 ppm, and they usually give a doublet or a multiplet depending on the neighboring protons. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests there's a double bond in the structure, maybe part of an ester group or a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry (MS) part. There's
