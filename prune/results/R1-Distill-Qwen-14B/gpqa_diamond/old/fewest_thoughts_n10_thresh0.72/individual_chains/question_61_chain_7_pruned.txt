Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with benzene and going through several products, ending up with product 5, which is one of the options A to D. I need to figure out what each reaction does and then determine the structure of product 5.

Let me start by breaking down each step.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.
Hmm, I remember that nitrating benzene usually involves HNO3 and H2SO4 as the nitrating agent. So benzene gets a nitro group. Where does it go? Benzene is symmetric, so nitration typically occurs at the para position, but wait, actually, nitration of benzene tends to form the nitro group in the meta position if there's no directing group, but wait no, wait. Oh wait, benzene itself is a ring with all H's equivalent, so nitration would produce nitrotoluene? No, wait, benzene just gets a nitro group, and since the starting material is benzene, the product would be nitrobenzene. But wait, nitration of benzene can give a mix of ortho, meta, and para, but in reality, it's para and ortho, but since it's a mononitration, under certain conditions, maybe it's more para. Wait, but the product is probably nitrobenzene, but I think the nitration of benzene gives a single product because all positions are same, but wait no, nitration is a meta director? No, wait, no. Benzene is an activating group, no, wait, no, benzene is the starting material. Wait, no, the nitration of benzene gives a nitro group, which is a meta director. But product 1 is nitrobenzene, so that's the first step.

Wait, maybe I should think about the nitration of benzene. Benzene, under HNO3 and H2SO4, undergoes electrophilic substitution to form nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and Fe powder, forming product 2.
Br2 with Fe is a brominating agent.
