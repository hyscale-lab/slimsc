Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, looking at the molecular formula C9H11NO2. The molecular weight would be 159 g/mol. Let me think about possible functional groups. The presence of N and O suggests maybe amides, esters, or something like that.

The IR data shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. So maybe there's an amide or amine group. Also, a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. Let's list the peaks:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something that's split into a triplet. Usually, that's a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl. So maybe an ethyl group somewhere.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet might indicate an exchange process, like an NH group or an -OCH2- group. Wait, but if it's an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would be around 4.1 as a quartet. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH2 group, but the integration is 2H. Wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe an -OCH2- group in an ester or ether. Or maybe a methylene adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests two neighboring protons. But 4.5 is a bit upfield for a CH2 next to an oxygen. Wait, but in an ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet, but usually I think OCH2CH3 is around 4.1. Hmm, unless it's a different environment. Or maybe it's part of a carbonyl group. Wait, wait, 4.5 quartet with 2H... Maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent group, like in an amide. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a CH2 connected to another group.

Then the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm as a doublet (2H) and 8.0 ppm as another doublet (2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, since the doublets are each integrating to two protons. So the substituent is in the para position, and the H on the aromatic ring are in a para substitution pattern.

Putting this together, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene ring connected to some substituent, with an ethyl group somewhere.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the meta position. But wait, the NMR shows a doublet at 7 and 8
