Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can vibrate and rotate, and their energy levels are quantized. The question says it's using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and it's supposed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy when it absorbs a photon. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the fundamental state... I think that's the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm not entirely sure. In the quantum harmonic oscillator model, the ground state is the lowest, and the first excited state is the next. So if the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the ground state, the next state would be the first excited state.

But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, the molecule can change either its vibrational or rotational state when absorbing a photon. Since the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, maybe it's considering transitions where both rotational and vibrational states change. But I'm a bit confused now.

The problem asks for the momentum of the absorbed photon. Photons carry energy and momentum. The energy of a photon is related to its frequency: E = hν. And momentum p is related to energy by p = E/c, where c is the speed of light.

So the key is to find the energy difference between the initial and final states, then compute the momentum from that energy.

Wait, but the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that implies the smallest possible energy increase. The fundamental state is the lowest, so the next state is the one where the molecule's energy is just a little higher than the fundamental.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the ground state of both rotation and vibration. So when it absorbs a photon, it can transition either to a higher vibrational state, a higher rotational state, or a combination. But what's the next lowest state?

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". Oh, so the lowest possible energy higher than the current state. So that would be the next state in the sequence that requires the least energy. So it might be the next vibrational level (v=1) if that's lower than the next rotational state, or the next rotational state if that's lower.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is modeled using both rotation and vibration, and the next state is the first possible one in either model.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the energy levels for rotation and vibration.

For a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number (0,1,2...). The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (1/2) hω + hω ν, where ν is the vibrational quantum number (0,1,2...).

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are considered, and in the harmonic oscillator model, the vibrational levels. But the non-rigid rotor model probably includes some flexibility, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation. Maybe for this problem, it's treated as a rigid rotor
