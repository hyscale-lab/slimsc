Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

So, the setup: There are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably means their velocities are consistent and we don't have to worry about elliptical complications.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. The RV method detects shifts in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect as the star moves because of the planet's gravity. The amount of shift tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. So, we're comparing the velocities of the stars due to their respective planets. 

Wait, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1-e²)^(0.5) * (1 + (M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) )) ) ) * ( (1/(P)) )^(1/3) )

But since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and M_p is much smaller than the star's mass (since Neptune is much less than the Sun), that part might simplify. Also, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term goes away.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) )) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), where a is the orbital radius. Or wait, another way: the RV semi-amplitude K is also given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P) / (2 * pi * (M_star + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no. Let me try to recall the correct formula. Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * P) / (2 * pi * (M_star)^2 ) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is about 1/7000th the mass of the Sun, and the stars are solar mass), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, that reduces to K ≈
