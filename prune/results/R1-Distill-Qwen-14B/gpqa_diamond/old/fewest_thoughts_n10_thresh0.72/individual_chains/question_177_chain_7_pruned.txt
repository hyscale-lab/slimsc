Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. The given data is that Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2. Also, Star 1's mass is 1.5 times larger than Star 2's. Hmm, but wait, the problem is about luminosity, so maybe the mass doesn't matter directly here. I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but I'll keep moving.

The important point is that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So, if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same? Because if lambda is the same, then T must be the same. That makes sense.

So both stars have the same temperature. Now, I need to find the ratio of their luminosities. I remember that the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same T, the L would be proportional to R squared. So the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 is 1.5 times R2, that ratio would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would make L1 about 2.25 times L2. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, which seems to fit.

Wait, but there's another part about radial velocities. The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star 1 and 700 km/s for Star 2. Hmm, how does that affect the problem? Oh, right! Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, but when we observe the star, things like Doppler shift can affect the observed wavelengths. But wait, the question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So maybe the Doppler shift doesn't affect the peak wavelength because they accounted for it?

Wait a minute, let me think. If a star is moving towards or away from us (radial velocity), its spectrum is shifted. If Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength would be different. But the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. So they must have corrected for the Doppler shift when determining the peak wavelengths. Or perhaps the Doppler shift isn't relevant here because the question is about the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but the question is about the actual luminosity, not the observed flux. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property. So maybe the radial velocities don't play a role in calculating the luminosity ratio. Because luminosity is independent of how fast the star is
