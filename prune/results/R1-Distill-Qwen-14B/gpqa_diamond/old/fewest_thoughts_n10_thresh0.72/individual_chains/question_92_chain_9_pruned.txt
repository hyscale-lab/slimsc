Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through what's being asked. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. 

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. I think it's a hydrocarbon with multiple double bonds. Maybe it's some kind of polyene or something like that. 

The data provided includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element and convert it into isolated atoms. So for carbon, which is usually tetrahedral in bonds, but maybe that's not directly relevant here.

Then there are bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. Oh wait, bond energies are the energy required to break a bond, right? So when you form a bond, you release that energy, and when you break, you use it.

The question is about enthalpy of formation. Oh wait, enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for this, we probably need to figure out how many bonds are formed and how many are broken from the elements.

Wait, but this is a bit confusing because the problem gives bond energies and the atomization energy. So maybe the approach here is to calculate the enthalpy change using bond energies. I think the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by subtracting the bond energies of the reactants (elements) from the bond energies of the products (the compound).

Wait no, maybe I should consider the formation of the molecule from its constituent atoms. Let's think about the process. To form the molecule, bonds form between atoms, releasing energy. But to get the atoms into that state, we might need to break some bonds if they are in a different form. 

Wait, but the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. So, for carbon, if it's in solid form, we need to break it into gaseous atoms. The enthalpy of atomization would be 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So if the molecule is made from carbon atoms, we'd need to consider that energy.

But then, the H-H bonds are also given. So maybe hydrogen is involved. Let's count the number of carbons and hydrogens in the molecule.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons and hydrogens.

Each (CH3)2C is a substituent. Let's break it down:

The main chain has:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : that's a propene-like group. So, 3 carbons (the CH2, CH, and the C=CH part? Maybe I should just count all the carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to draw the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the formula can be simplified. Let me write it as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each element. Let's count C and H.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: So each (CH3) has 3 Hs. There are two of them, so 2*3=6 Hs. The central C is connected to the CH2 and the double bond.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: the formula can be written as C n H m.

Wait, perhaps I'll count each part:

(CH3)2C=CH- : This is (CH3)2C=CH2, but in this case, it's attached to a chain. Wait, no, looking again, it's (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2C=CH- is three carbons: two CH3 groups attached to a C which is double-bonded to CH. 

Wait, maybe I can write the entire formula.

Wait, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : So that's three carbons (the C with two CH3 groups is the central one, then the CH, then the double bond).
Wait, perhaps each "CH3" is a methyl group attached to a central carbon. So (CH3)2C=CH- is CH2-C(CH3)2=CH- ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think in terms of each atom.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count the number of C and H atoms.

Let me count all the C:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: each (CH3) has one C, so two CH3's contribute 2 C. The central C is another, so 3 C. But wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-... So perhaps I should count each part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the formula is C12H20? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to count each carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps I'll count each Carbon and Hydrogen.

Looking at the formula:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : that's (CH3)2-C=CH-. So in this part:

Each CH3 has 1 C, so 2 C from CH
