Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I need to figure out why some peaks are disappearing when using a different fixation method. Hmm, let me think about what I remember regarding ChIP-seq and the fixation process.

Wait, the question says that they did ChIP-seq on PFA-fixed samples using an antibody for IKAROS in human B cells. Then they did the usual steps—sequencing, QC, alignment, peak-calling—which gave them some peaks. But when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. So I need to find out where these peaks would be, based on the fixation methods.

I remember that PFA, paraformaldehyde, is a crosslinker that's often used in ChIP. But wait, I think PFA is a formaldehyde-based fixative, right? Oh wait, no, wait—formaldehyde is another fixative. Wait, no. Wait, PFA is actually paraformaldehyde, which is a polymerizing agent. It's used in some fixation methods, like for electron microscopy. Oh, but in the context of ChIP, I think PFA is used for crosslinking proteins to DNA. Because formaldehyde is a common fixative for that purpose.

Wait, another point: DSG. DSG stands for Dithiothreitol, I believe. It's a reducing agent. Oh right, sometimes in ChIP protocols, after crosslinking with formaldehyde (or PFA?), they treat the cells with DSG to reduce disulfide bonds in proteins. Wait, but wait. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think.

So standard crosslinking for ChIP is typically done with formaldehyde. Formaldehyde crosslinks DNA-protein interactions. But sometimes, PFA is used as an alternative. I think PFA tends to form more stable crosslinks than formaldehyde. Or wait, maybe PFA is used in some protocols to crosslink more efficiently, especially in certain cell types where formaldehyde doesn't work as well.

Wait, but when you use PFA, sometimes you need to use a reducing agent like DSG to reverse the crosslinks. Because PFA can create more stable crosslinks, which are hard to reverse, so they add DSG to break them. So when you fix with PFA and then use DSG, it's supposed to help
