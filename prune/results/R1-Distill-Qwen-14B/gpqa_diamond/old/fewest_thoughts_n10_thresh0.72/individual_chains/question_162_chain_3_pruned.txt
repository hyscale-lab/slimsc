Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Alright, let's break it down.

Hmm, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that metrics are used in general relativity and differential geometry to define the geometry of a space. So this must be a two-dimensional metric because dx and dy are the differentials.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. I'm a bit rusty on that. A pseudosphere is like a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Or wait, maybe it's a surface with a finite area but infinite in some way. Oh, right! I think the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature which has finite area but infinite in extent. Like, you can fit it into a finite space but it's still infinitely long in some direction. 

So, the area of a pseudosphere with radius r. Wait, the radius here is given as r=2. But I'm not exactly sure how that relates to the metric. Let me think about the metric's form.

The metric looks like this: ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So, this is similar to the metric for a surface of revolution, maybe like a sphere or something else. Wait, no, for a sphere, the metric would have (1/(a² - x² - y²)) or something like that, but this has 4 in the denominator. Also, the numerator is 32, which is 16 * 2. Hmm.

Wait, I'm trying to recall the metric for a pseudosphere. The standard metric for a pseudosphere, which is a model of hyperbolic geometry, has a form like ds² = dr² + (a² / (1 - (r²/a²))) dθ², where a is the radius of curvature. But in 2D, maybe it's expressed differently.

Alternatively, another approach is to recognize the given metric. Let me see. The given metric has a denominator 4 - x² - y². That looks a bit like the metric for the sphere, but the sphere metric usually has (a² - x² - y²) in the denominator, but here it's 4, which is 2 squared. So perhaps the radius is 2 here. But how does this relate to a pseudosphere?

Wait, no, the sphere metric in 2D would be something like (dx² + dy
