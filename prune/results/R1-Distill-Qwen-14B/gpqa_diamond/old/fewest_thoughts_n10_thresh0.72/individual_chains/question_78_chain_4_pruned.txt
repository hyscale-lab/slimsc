Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t. The field is observed at r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time t_r) to r. The velocity at the generating time is v.

I remember that in electromagnetism, the potentials are scalar and vector potentials. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field.

Wait, the scalar potential for a static charge (like in Coulomb's law) is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things change because of special relativity and the fields' retarded times. Oh right, the potentials involve the retarded time because the fields take time to propagate.

So the scalar potential V is given by the charge divided by (4πε₀) times something involving the distance and maybe the velocity. Similarly, the vector potential A comes from the current or the velocity somehow.

Looking at the options, option A says V is the usual Coulomb potential, and A is v squared over c² times V. Hmm, I think A is usually proportional to the velocity. Option B has A as v over c² times V, which sounds more familiar because the vector potential often has a term with velocity divided by c squared.

Wait, but when the charge is moving, the potentials are modified by the motion. The scalar potential might not just be 1/r anymore. Because the charge's position is at a different point in the past (retarded time), the distance isn't just r, but depends on d and the velocity.

Oh right, the exact expression for V involves (d c - d·v), where d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to the observation point. Because the charge was moving, the distance isn't static. So the denominator would be something like (d c - d·v), where d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r.

Looking at the options, options C and D have this structure in the denominator. So for the scalar potential, it's (d c ± (d·v)) in the denominator.

Wait, the denominator comes from the relativistic correction. The term is probably (c t - d·v), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the denominator in the potential expressions involves (c t - (d · v)/c), or something like that. Hmm.

But in the problem statement, d is the vector from the field generating point (at t_r) to r. So when you calculate the position of the charge at t_r, the charge is at s(t_r), and r is the observation point. So the vector from the charge's position (s(t_r)) to r is d. So d = r - s(t_r).

In the expression for V, I think it's (d c - v d t), where d t is the time it took for the field to reach us. Wait, not exactly. Alternatively, the
