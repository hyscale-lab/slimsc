Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that's either propene or propane. Wait, propene is C3H6, and propane is C3H8. Oh wait, no, propene has the formula C3H6. So A is propene. Because if it were propane, the formula would be C3H8. So A is propene.

Then, Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes—so that's probably an addition reaction. Since carbon tetrachloride is a solvent, and bromine is added in a non-polar solvent, it's likely an addition across the double bond. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane, which is compound B. Wait, or maybe it's 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, when Br2 adds to a double bond, it adds across the double bond. So the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. That's 1,2-dibromopropane, so B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. Since B is a vicinal dibromide (two adjacent Brs), when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it should eliminate two HBr molecules. The reaction would form an alkene again. Wait, but which alkene? The starting material was propene, and adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Then eliminating two HBr would give back propene, but wait—could it form a different isomer, like maybe a different position? Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When adding Br2, it's between the two CH2 groups. So elimination would produce the same double bond. So compound C would be prop
