Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰.

Alright, the given information is: X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are all in meters, varying from 1e-9 m to 1e-1 m.

Wait, right. So the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So I think I'll need to use the Lorentz factor gamma for that.

First, I should find the velocity of the X⁰ particle. But wait, how do I get that? Oh, right, from the energy. Because energy is related to gamma times the rest mass energy. So the total energy E is gamma * m₀c². So gamma is E / (m₀c²). But since the units are in GeV, and m₀ is given in GeV/c² (since E = mc²), I can compute gamma as E / m₀.

Wait, E is 27 GeV, and m₀ is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 27 divided by 3.41. Let me do 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41*8 is 27.28. Oh, wait, 3.41 * 8 is 27.28, which is just a bit more than 27. So gamma is approximately 7.91, maybe around 7.92 or so. Let me compute it more accurately. 3.41 * 7.91 = ?

Wait, 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 0.91 is approximately 3.41 * 0.9 = 3
