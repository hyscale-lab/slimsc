Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, let me think this through. I remember that spin states are represented by vectors, and the expectation value is like the average value we'd expect to measure if we measured the spin many times on identically prepared systems.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i,4). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh right, the spin state is usually a two-component vector, like a column vector. So I think (3i,4) would be written as a column with the first component 3i and the second 4. So the state vector χ is [3i; 4].

I need to find the expectation value of S_y, which is the spin operator along the y-axis. I remember that the spin operators are given by S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix. So for S_y, it should be (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix.

Let me write down σ_y. Oh right, σ_y is:
[0  -i;
 i   0]

So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated as χ† S_y χ, where χ† is the conjugate transpose of χ.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the expectation value is the bra-ket product: ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. So first, I'll compute χ†, which is the conjugate transpose of χ. Since χ is [3i, 4], the conjugate would be [-3i, 4], and the transpose keeps it as a row vector. So χ† is [-3i, 4].

Now, I'll compute χ† multiplied by S_y, then multiply that by χ.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, compute χ† S_y. χ† is a row vector, S_y is a 2x2 matrix.

So χ† S_y = [ -3i   4 ] * (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Let me compute the matrix multiplication first, without the (ħ/2) factor for now.

Multiply [ -3i   4 ] with the σ_y matrix:

First element: (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 0 +4i =4i
Second element: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = (3i²) +0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute each element properly.

Matrix multiplication for row times matrix: each element is the sum of products of the row elements and column elements.

So row vector [a, b] multiplied by matrix [[c, d], [e, f]] is [ a*c + b*e , a*d + b*f ].

So for σ_y:

First element (row 1, column
