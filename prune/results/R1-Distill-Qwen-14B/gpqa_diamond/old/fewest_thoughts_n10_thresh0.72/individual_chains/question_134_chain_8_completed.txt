Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps to calculate this. Let me think.

The problem says we mix some HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. All three are being mixed together. So the first thing I need to do is figure out what reactions are happening here. I'm a bit confused because there are three different substances, but I think each acid will neutralize the base.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too but it's diprotic, right? And Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So each mole of acid will react with the base. But wait, no, because the base is a strong base, and the acids are also strong. So the reaction should proceed until one of them is all used up, I suppose. Or maybe they all react together?

Wait, no, maybe all the acid and base will react. Let me think about the moles. Because when you mix solutions, the total moles of acid and base will determine how much neutralization occurs.

So first, I need to calculate the moles of each acid and the base.

Let me start with HCl. Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl.

Next, H2SO4. It's 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL, 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. When you mix an acid with a base, the H+ from the acid reacts with OH- from the base to form water. So total H+ from acids is HCl and H2SO4.

HCl contributes 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles of H+.

Total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the reaction will go until either H+ or OH- is used up. Since OH- is 0.2 and H+ is 0.28, OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of OH- will react.

So all the OH- (0.2 moles) will react with H+ from the acids.

But wait, how much H+ is consumed? Each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of H+.

So 0.2 moles of H+ will be neutralized, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ (because 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08). Hmm, but wait, the excess H+ will come from where? Because the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid but only the first dissociation is complete, and the second might not be as strong? Or wait, no, I think in aqueous solution, H2SO4 is a strong acid and both protons are released. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+.

Wait, but when in solution, the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second may be as well. So for our purposes, we can consider all H+ from both acids to be available.

So, the total H+ is 0.28 moles, as I thought before.

OH- is 0.2 moles.

So all OH- will react, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain.

So the neutralization reaction will produce water from all 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but neutralization enthalpy is calculated per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

But wait, I've heard that the enthalpy of neutralization is typically around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (but that's for strong acids and strong bases). Wait, but wait, what's the standard value? Oh right, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ when an acid donates one H+ (like a monoprotic acid) and a strong base is used. For diprotic acids, like H2SO4, the first neutralization step is around -57 kJ/mol, and the second is about -43 kJ/mol because the second H+ comes from a weak acid (or maybe because the conjugate base is weaker), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, wait, no. H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both protons are strong. So when mixing with a strong base, each mole of H+ gives off about -57 kJ, but wait, no, because the second H+ is from a weaker acid. Or perhaps, for H2SO4, the first H+ is considered as a strong acid, and the second isn't? Or maybe it's because the second H+ comes from the bisulfate ion, which is a weaker acid.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

So when H2SO4 reacts with a base, the first H+ is released with a large enthalpy change, and the second H+ may have a different value. So the first neutralization step (acid: H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-) has a ΔH of about -57 kJ/mol. The second step (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) has a ΔH of about -43 kJ/mol. So each H+ ion contributes to the total enthalpy change.

But in this case, since we're mixing HCl (a monoprotic strong acid) and H2SO4 (a diprotic strong acid), the total H+ is 0.28 moles. But when reacting with OH-, each H+ will react, so each mole of H+ from HCl and H2SO4 contributes to the enthalpy change.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, the OH- is 0.2 moles, which is the limiting reagent. So only 0.2 moles of H+ will react with OH- to form water.

So the enthalpy change would be (moles of H+ reacting) × (ΔH per mole of H+).

But what is the ΔH per mole of H+?

Hmm. For strong acids and strong bases, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol H+. So each H+ gives off 57 kJ when neutralized.

But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so the first H+ is from H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (which has ΔH around -57 kJ/mol), and the second H+ is from HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- (ΔH around -43 kJ/mol).

So when H2SO4 reacts with a base, the first H+ neutralization gives -57 kJ, and the second gives -43 kJ.

So, in our case, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

But in the neutralization, all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with H+ from all sources.

Wait, but perhaps the order doesn't matter. Each H+ gives off its own ΔH.

But let me think about this. The total H+ available is 0.28 moles, but only 0.2 moles react with OH-.

Wait no, because the OH- is only 0.2 moles. So 0.2 H+ will react.

But these 0.2 H+ can come from either HCl or H2SO4.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes 0.1 moles of H+. H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles of H+.

So when the OH- comes in, which H+ reacts first? Maybe the strongest acids go first, but in reality, since they're both strong, all H+ is available.

Wait, perhaps it's best to calculate the total H+ and total OH- to find the neutralization.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with OH-.

The question is, which H+ are these 0.2 moles? Are they all from HCl, or a mix?

Wait, but for the purpose of calculating enthalpy, each H+ contributes according to their source.

Ah, so the 0.2 moles of H+ that react are from both sources.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of which H+ are used.

HCl provides 0.1 moles H+ (monoprotic, so each mole gives 1 H+).

H2SO4 provides 0.18 moles H+ (diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+).

So, when we have 0.2 moles of OH-, they will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

The H+ can come from HCl and H2SO4. So the enthalpy change would be the sum of the contributions from each H+.

But wait, each H+ from HCl contributes -57 kJ, and each H+ from H2SO4 (the first H+) contributes -57 kJ, but the second H+ from H2SO4 contributes -43 kJ.

Wait, but in this case, since all the H+ that reacts are from both, but let's think about how much H+ is used from each source.

So, the total H+ available is from HCl: 0.1 moles, and from H2SO4: 0.18 moles.

The OH- is 0.2 moles, so we can use up 0.2 H+.

Which H+ is used first? Hmm, perhaps the stronger acids are neutralized first, but since both are strong, it doesn't matter. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to assume that all H+ from HCl is used first, then from H2SO4.

Wait, HCl is 0.1 moles of H+. So if we use all 0.1 H+ from HCl, then the remaining 0.1 moles of OH- would come from H2SO4's H+.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe the approach is to consider that all the OH- will react with the available H+ from any source, regardless of which acid it comes from, and each H+ contributes its own enthalpy change.

So, the total enthalpy change is the sum of each H+ reacting multiplied by their respective enthalpy of neutralization.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that each mole of H+ contributes -57 kJ, except for the second H+ from H2SO4, which contributes -43 kJ.

But how do we know which H+ are being neutralized?

Wait, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should compute how much H+ is taken from each acid.

So, the OH- is 0.2 moles.

HCl provides 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 provides 0.18 moles H+.

So, the OH- will take the H+ from both sources.

First, it will take all 0.1 moles from HCl, leaving 0.1 moles of OH- to react with H2SO4's H+.

Wait, but H2SO4's H+ comes in two steps. The first H+ from H2SO4 is stronger, so it would donate it first. So, perhaps the OH- would first react with the HCl's H+, then with the first H+ from H2SO4, then the second.

So, first 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl react with 0.1 moles of OH-.

Then, 0.1 moles of OH- remain, which will react with H2SO4's H+.

H2SO4 can provide 0.18 moles of H+ (since each mole gives 2 H+).

So, the 0.1 moles of OH- can take 0.1 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

But which H+ from H2SO4? The first H+ is stronger, so it's used first.

So, the first 0.1 moles of H+ from H2SO4 (the first H+) would react, giving off -57 kJ/mol each, and the second H+ would be the remaining, but we don't react it here because only 0.1 moles of OH- are left after using HCl.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

The total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.2 (from H2SO4) = 0.3 moles H+.

Wait, no, H2SO4 is 0.09 moles, each giving 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

HCl is 0.1 moles H+.

So total H+ is 0.28.

OH- is 0.2.

So, the 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So, the 0.2 moles could be any combination from HCl and H2SO4.

But perhaps the HCl's H+ is used up first, since it's a monoprotic acid, and then the H2SO4's first H+ is used.

So:

First, 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl react with 0.1 moles OH-.

Enthalpy change: 0.1 * (-57) kJ = -5.7 kJ.

Then, the remaining 0.1 moles OH- will react with H2SO4's H+.

H2SO4 gives 2 H+ per mole. So 0.18 moles H+ in total.

The first H+ (0.18 moles) is stronger, so the OH- will take 0.1 moles of H+ from this first H+.

So, 0.1 moles H+ from H2SO4's first dissociation.

Enthalpy change: 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

Wait, but wait, each H+ from H2SO4 in the first dissociation gives -57, and the second gives -43.

So, if we have 0.1 moles of the first H+ reacting, that's -5.7 kJ.

So, the total enthalpy change is -5.7 (from HCl) + (-5.7) (from first H+ of H2SO4) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait, that's in kilojoules. The options have kcal and kJ. Oh, right, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, but the options are a mix. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184≈47.8). Option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the total is -11.4 kJ. So that would be approximately -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal because 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me compute that.

11.4 kJ is equal to how many kcal? Since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ.

So 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the total is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.2 kJ. So my calculation was -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, this is if each H+ contributes -57 kJ. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when you have H2SO4, the first H+ is considered as a strong acid (ΔH = -57 kJ/mol), but the second H+ (from HSO4^-) is weaker, so ΔH is about -43 kJ/mol.

So in our case, the 0.2 moles of H+ reacting are:

0.1 from HCl (each -57 kJ)

0.1 from H2SO4's first H+ (each -57 kJ)

So total ΔH is (0.1 * (-57) ) + (0.1 * (-57)) )= -11.4 kJ.

So, that's -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps the total H+ reacting is 0.2 moles, each giving -57 kJ, so 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So the answer would be A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another possible approach is to consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and each mole contributes two H+.

Wait, but let me think again: when H2SO4 reacts with a base, the first H+ neutralization releases about -57 kJ, and the second releases about -43 kJ.

So for each mole of H2SO4, the first H+ gives -57, and the second gives -43. So for a mole of H2SO4, the total is -100 kJ.

But in our case, the H+ from HCl and the first H+ from H2SO4 are the ones reacting.

Wait, but in the calculation, we used 0.1 moles from HCl and 0.1 moles from H2SO4's first H+.

So each of these contributes -57 kJ, so total is -11.4 kJ.

So the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

Looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches.

So the answer should be option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.2 M.  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, moles of H⁺ = 0.1 moles.
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity = 0.3 M.  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L, Molarity = 0.5 M.  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - Total H⁺ available = 0.28 moles.  
     Total OH⁻ available = 0.2 moles.  
     OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it will be completely neutralized by 0.2 moles of H⁺.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol H⁺} \).  
     Since 0.2 moles of H⁺ react with OH⁻, the total enthalpy change is:  
     \( \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert to kcal (if required):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \).  
     \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Match with the options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
   - Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) corresponds to \( -48.5 \, \text{kJ} \), which is incorrect.  
   - Option C (\( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \)) and Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) are also incorrect.

**Answer: A**
