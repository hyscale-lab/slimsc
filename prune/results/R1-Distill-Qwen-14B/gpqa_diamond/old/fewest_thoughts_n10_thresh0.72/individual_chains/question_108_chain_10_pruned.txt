Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The magnetic field is along the Oz axis, and it's small values of m. The field is 1 Tesla, which is pretty strong, I think. The hydrogen atom has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that's the wavelength corresponding to a particular energy transition, right?

Wait, paramagnetic coupling term... Oh, right, in the context of atoms in a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian has terms like the Zeeman term. The paramagnetic term is probably the contribution from the electron's orbital motion, and the diamagnetic term is from the spin, but I'm not entirely sure. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh, the paramagnetic term comes from the orbital magnetic moment interacting with the magnetic field, while the diamagnetic term is from the spin. No, wait, no—actually, I think the paramagnetic term is due to the orbital angular momentum and the diamagnetic is due to the spin. Or maybe the other way around. Hmm. Or perhaps in this context, the paramagnetic coupling is the part that depends on the magnetic quantum number m.

Wait, the problem says 'paramagnetic coupling term', so that's probably the term H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, the magnetic moment due to orbital angular momentum is μ = (e/(2m_e)) * L, right? So the orbital magnetic moment is proportional to L, which is related to the quantum number l.

The magnetic field is B, and the term in the Hamiltonian would be something like H = -μ·B. Let me think about the expression. Oh, right, the Zeeman term is H = -μ·B, which can be written as H = (μ_B * m_l) * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Because the orbital magnetic moment is μ = μ_B * m_l, where m_l is the orbital magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but the problem says 'small values of m'—so I think m here refers to m_l, the orbital magnetic quantum number. So m can be 0, ±1, etc., up to l. But in this case, m is small, so maybe m=0? Or perhaps m
