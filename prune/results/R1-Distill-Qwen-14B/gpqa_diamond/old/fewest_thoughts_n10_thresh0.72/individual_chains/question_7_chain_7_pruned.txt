Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by this process. Hmm, I remember that high-energy particles can interact with the CMB, and their lifetimes are affected by such interactions. 

The reaction in question is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs: γγ → e+ e-. So the problem is about finding the gamma-ray energy where this process becomes significant enough to limit the gamma's lifetime.

I think I should start by considering the cross-section for this process. The cross-section (σ) depends on the energy of the gamma-rays. Wait, how does it scale with energy? I recall that for pair production via the CMB, the cross-section increases at higher energies because the photon density is higher? Or is it the other way around? Or maybe it's a specific energy dependence.

Wait, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- has a certain dependence on the center-of-mass energy. Oh right, the threshold energy for this reaction is when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so the threshold would be twice that, 1.022 MeV. But the problem is about high-energy gamma-rays, so they're way above the threshold.

But wait, the question is about the energy where the annihilation process limits the gamma-ray's lifetime. So the lifetime is determined by how quickly the gamma interacts with the CMB photons. That makes me think of the photon's mean free path. The mean free path λ is the inverse of the photon density multiplied by the cross-section. So the lifetime τ would be λ divided by the speed (since τ = distance / speed, and with speed c, τ = λ/(c)).

So τ = 1/(n σ v), but wait, let me think. The mean free path is λ = 1/(n σ), where n is the number density of target CMB photons. The cross-section σ is for the gamma-photon interaction (since each CMB photon is a target). 

So the gamma-ray's lifetime τ is the mean free path divided by the speed of light, τ = λ / c = (1/(n σ)) / c.

But wait, the number density n of CMB photons... The CMB has a temperature of about 2.7 K. The photon number density can be calculated using the formula for a blackbody. The number density is given by n = (8 π g / (c^3 h^3)) * (k_B T)^4 / (e^{E/(k_B T)} - 1), but for photons, each mode is g=2 (since two polarizations). Wait, but more accurately, the average energy is given, which is 1e-3 eV. 

Wait, the problem states that the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV. Hmm. Since for a blackbody, the average energy is about 2.7 k_B T, where k_B is the Boltzmann constant. But maybe I don't need to get
