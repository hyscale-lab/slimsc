Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is about.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions with two unknown compounds, A and B, using different reducing agents. The products are given as (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The task is to figure out what the starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, okay. So both reactions produce a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one derivative, but with different configurations—R and S. The reducing agents used are LiBH4 and BH3, which I remember are different in their reducing capabilities. Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. LiBH4 is commonly used to reduce ketones to alcohols, but wait, BH3 is typically used for more selective reductions, maybe in the presence of certain catalysts or in specific conditions.

Wait, no, wait. I'm a bit confused. Let me think. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters or ketones. BH3 is usually used in the form of BH3·THF or something, and it's a milder reducing agent, perhaps for aldehydes and ketones but maybe with different regiochemistry or stereochemistry.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro pyran
