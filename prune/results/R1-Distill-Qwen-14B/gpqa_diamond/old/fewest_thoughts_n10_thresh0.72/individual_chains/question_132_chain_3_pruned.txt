Okay, so I have this NMR question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, each with the molecular formula C10H14. Their 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different pairs of compounds, and I need to figure out which pair matches the NMR data.

Hmm, okay. Let me break down the given information.

First, the molecular formula is C10H14. For aromatic compounds, the degree of unsaturation would be 4 (since C10H14: each degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. 2n +2 = 2*10 +2=22; 14 is 8 less, so 8/2=4, so four degrees. So one benzene ring (3 degrees) and one double bond or a ring? Wait, benzene is three degrees, so the fourth would be another ring or a double bond elsewhere, but in this case, I think it's another substituent on the benzene. Wait, no, wait, the molecular formula: for benzene, it's C6H6. So if we have C10H14, then subtract C6H6, we get C4H8. But wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, molecular formula for benzene is C6H6. So C10H14 is C4H8 more than benzene. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the degree of unsaturation calculation: each ring or double bond is one degree. So for C10H14: 2C +2 = 2*10 +2=22. 22-14=8, so 8/2=4 degrees. One benzene ring gives three degrees, so the remaining one degree could be another ring or a double bond. But since the compounds are aromatic, maybe it's another ring. Wait, but if the compound is a substituted benzene, like with methyl groups, then maybe the extra degrees come from substituents. Oh wait, perhaps the substituents are alkyl groups, which might add more hydrogens but not more degrees of unsaturation. So perhaps the compounds are disubstituted or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should focus more on the NMR data.

The aromatic protons are in two singlets at around 6.7 ppm, each a singlet. So each compound must have equivalent aromatic protons that give a singlet. Wait, but wait: the spectrum shows two singlets, and the ratio is 1:1 between them. So each singlet corresponds to one of the compounds. That suggests that each compound has a single type of aromatic proton, leading to a singlet.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if one compound has two sets of equivalent protons (like a para-substituted compound), maybe they would give a singlet if they're all equivalent. Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, all the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes except one, which is diethyl. Let's list the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene has each ethyl group attached to the benzene at positions 1 and 4. So its structure would be two ethyl groups para to each other.

Wait, but I'm supposed to figure out which two compounds fit the NMR data. Let me think about each possible pair.

The NMR has two singlets in the aromatic region, each at 6.7 ppm. So each compound must have only one type of aromatic proton, leading to a singlet. So each compound would be highly symmetrical, or perhaps each has equivalent protons.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the aromatic regions. If a compound has equivalent protons in all aromatic positions, that would result in a singlet. So for example, in para-substituted diethylbenzene, the aromatic protons would be at the ortho and meta positions, but perhaps they are equivalent, so a singlet.

Wait, but diethylbenzene would have substituents at 1 and 4 positions. So the aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6 positions. Are they equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. Positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and 3 and 5 would be equivalent. But if the substituents are at 1 and 4, then positions 2 and 6 are ortho to the substituent at 1, and meta to 4. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 are meta to 1 and ortho to 4. I'm getting a bit confused, but perhaps in this case, the aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving a singlet.

Alternatively, let's think about the tetramethylbenzenes. For example, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. The remaining positions are 3 and 6. So the aromatic protons would be at 3 and 6, which are equivalent due to symmetry. So the NMR would show a singlet for those protons.

Wait, but wait. Let me imagine the structure. For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: the substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to substituents. Let's see: in such a structure, would the protons at 3 and 6 be equivalent? Because the substituents are at 1 and 2 (so adjacent), and 4 and 5 (also adjacent). So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between positions 1 and 6, perhaps. Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a certain symmetry that
