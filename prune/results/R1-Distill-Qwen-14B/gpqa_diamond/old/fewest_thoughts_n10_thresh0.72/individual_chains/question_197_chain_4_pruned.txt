Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question carefully. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product based on the IR and NMR data provided.

Let's start by looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-¹, which probably indicates an O-H stretch because that region usually corresponds to alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, also a strong peak at 1720 cm-¹. That's a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. Oh, but carboxylic acids have their O-H around 2500-3300 usually, but that's a broad peak. Wait, but the IR here has the 3400-2500 region, which is a broad area, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid, which is usually around 1700. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ring attached, which could shift the peak up. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl with electron-withdrawing groups.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or, wait, could it be a carboxylic acid proton? Because carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, but they're usually broad. So this might be a carboxylic acid. Because 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde, but sometimes aldehydes can be that high. Alternatively, maybe an enolic proton or something else. Hmm.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. So maybe there's a substituent on the benzene ring. The doublets suggest a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. For example
