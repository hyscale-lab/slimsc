Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These infinities can cause problems because they don't give meaningful physical results. Regularization helps to make these calculations finite so that you can renormalize them, right?

So, the question is asking which theory doesn't need this regularization when dealing with high energies. Let's go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't really have the same issues with divergences as quantum theories do. I mean, in classical electromagnetism, you don't have the same kind of infinities because everything is deterministic and governed by Maxwell's equations. Oh wait, but waitâ€”there are some issues, like the infinite charge density at a point charge, but those are more conceptual and don't require regularization in the same way as in quantum field theories. Because in classical physics, you can just use the equations without needing renormalization techniques. So maybe classical E&M doesn't require regularization? That could make sense.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I know that QED does require renormalization. When you calculate loop
