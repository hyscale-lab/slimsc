Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed. They compare this to the effect of an exoplanet, and we need to find the exoplanet's radius relative to the star.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They mention that the spots cause brightness variations due to rotation, and this is similar to what an exoplanet would do. We need to find the radius ratio of a planet that would produce the same light curve amplitude.

Wait, so the amplitude of the brightness variation is what we're after. When a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the light, and the drop in brightness is what we detect. Similarly, the spots on the star would cause a variation as the star rotates and the spots come into and out of view.

But wait, the problem says that the star's signal is due to spots, but if it were a planet, how big would the planet be to cause the same amplitude. So, we need to compute the amplitude caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same drop.

Let me think about how the brightness variation works. For a planet transit: the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the drop is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk divided by the star's area.

Now, for the spots: each spot is cooler, so when it's facing us, it contributes less light. The total brightness variation will depend on the area covered by the spots and the temperature difference.

Wait, but how do we calculate the change in brightness due to spots? I remember that the flux from a star is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its temperature. When spots cover a part of the star, the total flux is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area, each contributing according to their temperatures.

So the star's normal flux is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (Rstar^2 * pi), but wait, actually the
