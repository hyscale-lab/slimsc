Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me see. The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n, and the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. I'm supposed to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab frame. The options are A to D, with B being 1, which I think is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the light is in glass, so its speed should be c/n, right?

Wait, but the glass is moving. Does that affect the speed? I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Like, if you have a car moving at velocity u relative to the ground, and inside the car, a ball is thrown at velocity v relative to the car, the ground observes the ball's velocity as u + v, but only if v is much smaller than the speed of light. But wait, when velocities are significant fractions of c, you can't just add them like that. You have to use the velocity addition formula from relativity.

But wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Oh wait, no, that's in a vacuum. But the glass is a medium, so the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the rest frame of the glass. But when the glass itself is moving, does the speed of light as observed change? Hmm. So the lab frame sees the glass moving at velocity v. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. So how do we transform that into the lab frame?

I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall that formula. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ² ), where u is the velocity of an object in the original frame, and u' is its velocity in the frame moving at velocity v relative to the original. But wait, in this case, the light's velocity in the glass's frame is c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving towards the observer at v),
