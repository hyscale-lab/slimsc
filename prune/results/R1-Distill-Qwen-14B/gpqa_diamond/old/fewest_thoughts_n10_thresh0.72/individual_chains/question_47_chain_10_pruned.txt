Okay, so I have this question about identifying a compound using spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can figure out.

The compound has the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. The formula is C9H11NO2. The general formula for degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so it's (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Wait, because N adds as +1. So (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) plus a double bond or two rings, but more likely a benzene and maybe an ester or amide group.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide because a ketone would be around 1700 maybe, but depends. Wait, amides have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1650-1700, while esters are higher, 1720-1760. So 1720 is more ester-like, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, could it be a carboxylic acid? But the IR might show a broad O-H stretch for that, which I don't see here. So maybe an ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's a typical ethyl group attached to something else. Like OCH2CH3 or something similar. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons, so maybe a CH2CH2 group. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Broad suggests exchange or maybe NH protons? But wait, a singlet with 2H. If it's NH2, but in that region? Or maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps it's
