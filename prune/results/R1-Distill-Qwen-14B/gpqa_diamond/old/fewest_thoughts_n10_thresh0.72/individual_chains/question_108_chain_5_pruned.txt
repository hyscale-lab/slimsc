Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. Oh right, in the hydrogen atom, the magnetic field direction would affect the energy levels through the Zeeman effect. But wait, the problem is about paramagnetic coupling. Oh right, paramagnetism is when the magnetic moments of electrons interact with an external magnetic field.

The problem gives m as a small orbital magnetic quantum number. So m is small, maybe 1 or 2? I'm not sure, but I guess m being small means the electron's angular momentum projection is low. But how does that affect the coupling term?

The question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment and the field) to the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition energy has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that's the wavelength for the Lyman series or Balmer series? Oh, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about 486 nm, which I think is the Balmer-alpha line, the H-alpha emission. So that corresponds to a transition in the hydrogen atom, probably between n=2 and n=1? Or maybe n=3 to n=2? Let me think. The Balmer series is transitions to n=2, so H-alpha is from n=3 to n=2. So the energy difference ΔE is the energy of that photon.

Now, the paramagnetic term is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. The magnetic interaction energy is given by the Zeeman term. The formula I remember is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is related to the spin or orbital angular momentum. Oh wait, but in the hydrogen atom, the paramagnetic effect is due to the electron's orbital angular momentum and its spin. But in this case, since it's a magnetic field applied (the paramagnetic coupling), I think it's the orbital contribution. Alternatively, maybe in this context, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, so we're considering the orbital Zeeman effect.

Wait, the orbital Zeeman effect is when the magnetic field perturbs the energy levels based on the orbital angular momentum. The energy shift is given by ΔE_zeeman = (μ_B * B * m) / (something), where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, the exact formula is ΔE = (μ_B * B * m) / (something else?) Let me recall. The orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (eħ)/(2m_e) * L_z/(ħ) )? Wait, no, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e), right? So the energy due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B. If the magnetic field is along the z-axis, then H = -μ_z B. So, μ_z for orbital angular momentum is m * μ_B. So H =
