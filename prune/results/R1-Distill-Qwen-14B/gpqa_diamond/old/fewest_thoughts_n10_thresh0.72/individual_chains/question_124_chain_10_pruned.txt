Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20 on average. The detector's radius is 30 meters. 

The key point given is that, on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The question asks what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

Hmm. So I think I need to relate the Lorentz factor to how far the particles travel before decaying. Since the detector is spherical and the particles are moving in all directions, I guess the distance they need to travel to reach the wall is the radius, which is 30 meters.

Wait, right. The particles are produced at the center, so they have to travel a distance equal to the detector's radius to reach the inner walls. So the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying determines whether it reaches the detector's walls.

But particles decay over time, so the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) would influence how far they can travel. The proper lifetime is the average lifetime, I think. So the actual lifetime from our perspective (lab frame) would be gamma times the proper lifetime, because of time dilation.

So the distance a particle travels before decaying is its speed multiplied by its lifetime. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is roughly the speed of light, so distance ≈ c * gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but for a given particle, the distance it travels before decaying depends on gamma. So for a particle to reach the wall, the gamma multiplied by tau must be at least equal to the radius of the detector.

Wait, but the problem says that on average one third reach the walls. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Suppose the proper lifetime is tau. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. The particle's speed is approximately c (since they're ultra-relativistic, so beta ≈ 1). So the distance the particle travels is c * gamma * tau.

If the particle doesn't decay before reaching the wall, then c * gamma * tau should be greater than or equal to the radius R (30 meters). But wait, no. Because if the particle's lifetime is such that it decays before reaching R, then it doesn't make it to the wall.

Alternatively, the particles have a certain probability of decaying before traveling distance R. So the fraction that reaches the detector walls is the probability that they don't decay within the time it takes to reach R.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the decay process is exponential. The probability that a particle doesn't decay before time t is exp(-t / tau), where tau is the mean lifetime (proper time). But wait, no, in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper mean lifetime. So the time in the lab frame is gamma tau_0.

Wait, let's get this right. The proper lifetime is tau_0. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau_0. So the time it takes for the particle to reach the detector's wall is t = R / (beta c). Since beta is approximately 1, t ≈ R/(c). 

So the probability that a particle doesn't decay before time t is exp(-t / (gamma tau_0)), because the decay follows an exponential distribution. Wait, no, the decay rate is gamma (from the particle's perspective), but in the lab frame, the decay rate is adjusted due to time dilation. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, the mean proper lifetime is tau_0. The lab frame measures the lifetime as gamma tau_0. So the decay probability is based on the lab frame time.

So the time to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c). Since beta is close to 1, t ≈ R/c.
