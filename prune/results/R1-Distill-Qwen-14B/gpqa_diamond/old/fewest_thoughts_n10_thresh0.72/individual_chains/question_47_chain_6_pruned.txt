Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about identifying an organic compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see. The options are A to D, each a different compound. I'll need to break down the data step by step.

First, the IR data. It shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. But the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or amide. Since it's around 1720, that's more likely an ester or amide. Because amides typically have lower wavenumbers for the carbonyl, but wait, maybe it's an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR now. Let's list the peaks:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, like an ethyl group. Because a triplet at around 1.2 usually comes from a CH2CH3 group where the CH3 is next to the CH2.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad usually means exchange or maybe an NH group, but wait, if it's singlet and 2H, maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps an NH2? Hmm, but in the IR, we didn't see a very strong N-H stretch that would correspond to a broad peak in the NMR. Wait, the IR has two bands around 3400, which could be from two N-H stretches, maybe an amine or amide.

- 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H suggests maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Like, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have a quartet at around 4.1, but here it's 4.5. Wait, maybe it's an ester group, like OCH2 connected to another group. Or perhaps a CH2 that's adjacent to an electronegative atom, causing it to split into a quartet.

- 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each a doublet of 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield shift at 8.0 could be due to electron-withdrawing groups. So maybe a substituent like -NO2, -COOH, or something else. But in the molecular formula, there's an O2, so maybe a carbonyl group attached.

Let me think about the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the meta position. The benzamide has a CONH2 group. The IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1680 (amide is lower than ester), but here it's 1720. So maybe not an amide then? Alternatively, could it be a different group?

Option B
