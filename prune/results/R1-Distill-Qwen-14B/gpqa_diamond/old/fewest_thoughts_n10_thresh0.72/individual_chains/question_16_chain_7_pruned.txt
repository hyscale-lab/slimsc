Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Then, based on that count, choose the correct option from A to D.

Optical activity, right, that's when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which means it has chiral centers. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. Alternatively, the compound might have an element of symmetry or a plane of symmetry; if it does, it's not chiral and won't be optically active.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Hmm, wait. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, noâ€”wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw that. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene has the double bond starting at carbon 1. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-Cl? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH2-C=
