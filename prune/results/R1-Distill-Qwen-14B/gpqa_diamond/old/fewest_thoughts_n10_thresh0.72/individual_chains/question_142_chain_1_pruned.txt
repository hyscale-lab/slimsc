Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in qubit space. Hmm.

Alright, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that the density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So, this particular ρ looks like it's a mixture of the states |0> and |1>.

Wait, what do I know about the Bloch sphere? Oh right, qubits can be represented on a unit sphere called the Bloch sphere. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a pure state, but for mixed states, it's a bit different. There's something about the density matrix being diagonal and how that affects the position on the Bloch sphere.

So, the density matrix for a pure state is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But when you have a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture. In this case, the density matrix is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. So it's an equal mixture of the two basis states. I think this should be the completely mixed state for a qubit.

I remember that the completely mixed state is represented by the state (0,0,1) in the Bloch sphere coordinates. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Bloch vector is (x,y,z), where z is the expectation value along the z-axis. For the density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector components are given by certain expectation values.

The density matrix for a single qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (rx, ry, rz). So if ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, let's compute that.

Wait, |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Multiply by 1/2, so ρ is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. 

So the
