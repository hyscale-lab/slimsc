Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, that's written as 1/plx^5. So, Number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. Got it.

And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So, I think they want to know the relationship between the number of stars and the distance r. The options are various powers of r: r cubed, r to the fifth, r squared, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Or wait, plx is in arcseconds, right? So the formula is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So if distance r increases, plx decreases.

So if the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, let's write that as N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, that means 1/plx is r. So substituting, 1/plx^5 is (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Parallax plx = 1/r. So 1/plx = r. So (1/plx)^5 = r^5. Therefore, N = k * (1/plx)^5 = k r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of r.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Does the question mean how does the density or the count per some volume change, or the total number in a certain distance range?

Wait, let's think about it. The number of stars in a region—assuming that these stars are spread out, and considering that the way we observe them is based on their distance.
