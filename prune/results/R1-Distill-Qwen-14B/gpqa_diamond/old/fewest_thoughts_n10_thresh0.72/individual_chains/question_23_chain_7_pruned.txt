Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about what happens when a specific compound reacts with hydrogen bromide (HBr). 

The compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, I should probably draw that structure to visualize it better. Let's see, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether part is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), right? So breaking that down: but-3-en-1-yl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think again. But-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, but but is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but has four carbons, so the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 3. Oh wait, that can't be right because position 3 would be the third carbon, so but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O- attached to the benzene?

Wait no, perhaps I got the substituents wrong. The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is: the butenyl group is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But with substituents. Wait, but the substituents are on C2, two methyl groups. So the structure is:

The group is (but-3-en-1-yl) with two methyl groups on C2. So the structure is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me think again.

But-3-en-1-yl is
