Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that someone has prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So that means the ring has two substituents attached. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an O in the ester linkage. So the compound probably has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum description: there are six signals. Let me break those down. Two signals are for aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern can affect the NMR signals. For example, if the substituents are para, there would be two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, but if they're meta, there might be more signals. Wait, but the substituents might not both be the same. Hmm.

Wait, the compound is di-substituted, but the substituents could vary. Like one could be a methyl and another an ester group, but I don't know yet. But the ester group itself is a substituent.

Then, two signals correspond to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets or maybe multiplets depending on the structure. Wait, vinyl could be from an ethylene group, like an alkene. So perhaps the compound has an ethenyl (vinyl) group attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the ester. The ester group is usually something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait no, ester is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. So if the aromatic ring has an ester substituent, that would be a COO group attached.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR signals:

- Aromatic-H: two signals. So maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two sets of aromatic protons. Like if it's para-substituted, but with two different substituents. Or perhaps another substitution pattern.

- Vinyl-H: two signals, one a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. That suggests split due
