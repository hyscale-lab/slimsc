Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and figure it out step by step. 

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But more importantly, it's about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm. I need to figure out which compounds don't show tautomerism and which show optical isomerism.

The problem states: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism (that's part A). Then, among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism (that's part B). The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possibilities for A and B.

Let me tackle part A first. So, what's tautomerism? I remember that tautomerism involves the migration of a hydrogen atom along with the shift of a double bond or lone pair. It's a type of isomerism where two compounds have the same molecular formula but different structures, but more specifically, tautomerism is when a hydrogen atom and a lone pair shift positions, leading to different structures, like in keto-enol tautomerism.

Looking at benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone groups, right? It can exist in two forms: para-benzoquinone and ortho-benzoquinone. Alternatively, benzoquinone might refer to 1,4-benzoquinone, which is the para form.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, it's a fully symmetrical structure, all positions are equivalent. 

Tautomerism requires that the structure can shift to another structure with the same connectivity but different arrangement. So, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Well, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. For tautomerism to occur, I think you need conjugated systems where H and lone pair can shift. Benzoquinone has two ketones; perhaps it can tautomerize, but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's more about whether the structure allows for keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, another angle: if a compound has multiple ketone groups, maybe it can't undergo tautomerism because the necessary hydrogen isn't present. Alternatively, maybe the presence of conjugated double bonds or lone pairs allows for it.

Wait, I remember that tautomerism is seen in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups. Because in such cases, a hydrogen can shift from an adjacent carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, leading to a different structure. For example, in 3,4-diketones, tautomerism
