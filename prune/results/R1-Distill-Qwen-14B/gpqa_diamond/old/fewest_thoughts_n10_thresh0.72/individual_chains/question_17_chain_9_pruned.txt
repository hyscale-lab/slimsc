Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25Â°C, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is a complex ion where EDTA is bound to calcium. The K here is the formation constant, which tells us how strong the complex is.

Wait, the formation constant (K) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for the formation constant is something like K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Right, because EDTA in solution exists in different protonated forms, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe we don't have to worry about that. Maybe they're assuming that the majority of EDTA is in the form that can form the complex, like Y^4-.

So the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. That means [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M at the start. But because the complex can dissociate, some of it will break down into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, wait. The problem is about the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So I need to find [Ca^2+].

The K expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, if we start with 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, and it dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, how much of each do we get?

Let me think. Let's denote the change. Let's say that the concentration of CaEDTA^2- decreases by x, so it becomes 0.02 - x. Then, the concentration of Ca^2+ would be x, and EDTA^4- would also be x. Because the stoichiometry is 1:1:
