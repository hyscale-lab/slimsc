Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a particle of mass m in a three-dimensional isotropic potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this is a harmonic oscillator potential because it looks like the potential energy for a spring, which follows Hooke's law. So, the force acting on the particle is like a spring force, F = -m ω² r, which makes sense because F = -k r where k is the spring constant, and here k would be m ω².

The question asks about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving an energy expression and a number.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the 3D harmonic oscillator is a good example of a system where each degree of freedom (x, y, z) contributes to the total energy. Oh wait, but in spherical coordinates, it's actually treated in terms of radial and angular parts. But wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels for a harmonic oscillator are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Because in 3D, each direction (x, y, z) is a 1D harmonic oscillator. The energy is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2 ), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So the total quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, but wait, another thought. In 3D, the energy levels are actually quantized such that each level corresponds to a certain n, which is n_x + n_y + n_z. For each n, the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħ ω, because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħ ω.

So the ground state is the lowest energy, which is when n = 0. So n_x = n_y = n_z =
