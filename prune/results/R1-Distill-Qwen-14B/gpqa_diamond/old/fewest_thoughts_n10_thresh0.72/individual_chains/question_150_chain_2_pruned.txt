Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO is reacted with three reagents in sequence. The reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. The task is to identify the final product from the given options based on the NMR data.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR shows the following peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's think about what these signals could represent. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet, and that's a high chemical shift. That usually suggests an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. The triplet (t) suggests that the aldehyde proton is next to two other equivalent protons. Wait, but aldehydes are usually at the end of the chain, so maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

Looking at the other peaks: the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each integrating to 2H. Those are probably aromatic protons. Since they're doublets, maybe they are part of a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para-substituted ring, each set of protons would be a doublet. Wait, but if it's para substitution, each set would be a pair of doublets. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ortho substitution, but that would give more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe they're part of a meta substituted ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the integration is 2H each. Maybe each is a pair of aromatic protons, perhaps from two different benzene rings. Let me think. Another possibility is that they're from a substituted aromatic ring, like a para-substituted ring. Wait, but if the molecule has two benzene rings, that would account for more protons. But in this case, each is 2H. So maybe each is a pair from a monosubstituted benzene ring. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons on the ring would be equivalent and give a doublet.

The peak at 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet. Broad suggests exchange or perhaps coupling with multiple protons. Maybe this is an enol proton or something like that. Alternatively, it might be adjacent to an electronegative atom, but that's less likely. Or perhaps it's a vinyl proton that's part of a conjugated system.

The peak at 3.66 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H. That's around where you'd expect protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or an ester. Or maybe it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like
