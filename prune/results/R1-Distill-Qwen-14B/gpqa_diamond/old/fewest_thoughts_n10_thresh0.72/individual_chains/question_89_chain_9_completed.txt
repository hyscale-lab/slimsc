Okay, let me try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

So the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, a light yellow solid. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably E2, forming an alkene. So, the product should be an adamantene derivative with a double bond. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, but wait, elimination usually forms alkenes, not carbonyls. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely. Oh, but substitution would form an epoxide? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, another thought: could it be a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, but then maybe something else? Oh wait, perhaps I misread the IR part. Because if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe the IR is from an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo—so two bromines on adjacent carbons. KOH in heat would likely lead to elimination, so forming an alkene. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps 1,3-dibromo to 1,3-epoxide? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a dihalide elimination to form a diene. So, product 1 would be the diene, adamantadiene.

But the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a substitution leading to a carbonyl. No, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH... wait, in such conditions, maybe it's a double elimination, but perhaps leading to a diketone. Oh! Because if each Br is replaced by an OH, but wait, that would be diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination forming an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps I got the reaction wrong. Let me think again. KOH is a strong base, so when vicinal dihalides react with it, they eliminate to form alkenes. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But where does the IR peak at 1720 come in? Oh, unless I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the product isn't an alkene but an epoxide? No, because epoxides would show an IR peak around 1200-1250 for the C-O-C stretch, not 1720. So that's not it. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But with KOH, for vicinal dihalides, substitution would not happen; elimination is more likely. So I'm a bit confused about the IR. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, no, how? Unless the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else. Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a very rigid molecule. When you have vicinal dihalide, elimination would form a double bond within the adamantane structure. So product 1 would have a double bond.

But the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Maybe the product isn't an alkene. Alternative pathway: perhaps it's an epoxide. But no, I don't think so.

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 1 is a ketone. How? Could the reaction be a nucleophilic substitution leading to a carbonyl group. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons. If KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a double bond. So product 1 is a diene, which would have an alkene. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl absorption.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a diketone. But how? That would require two substitutions, replacing Br with O groups. But with KOH, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but that doesn't fit the elimination mechanism. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 is probably a triplet or something, but the integral is 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 group attached to something deshielding, like an oxygen. Oh! Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, but earlier I thought that would be an elimination. Wait, no, epoxides are formed from alcohols via acid catalysis, not KOH. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretches. Or perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, another approach: think about the IR. 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

How could 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone with KOH? Wait, maybe via a double elimination, but that would form an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of elimination followed by some kind of oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not seeing the connection to a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product isn't a ketone. Another possibility: maybe the IR peak is from an ester or an ether. Ethers have C-O stretches around 1100 cm-1, which the problem doesn't mention. Ester carbonyls are around 1720, so that's possible. So maybe product 1 is an ester. But how do we get an ester from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? I don't think so, unless there's another reaction. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride, but no, product 1 was formed with KOH, which wouldn't give an acyl chloride. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, but I don't see how.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, then treating it with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 might cause ring-opening via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. But I'm not sure if that leads to anything specific that would help in the next step.

Wait, perhaps the first step is elimination to form an alkene. Then product 2 is formed by reacting with Al isopropoxide. Maybe it's a diene undergoing some cycloaddition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Let's see: a dihalide reacting with KOH could form an epoxide, but I think that's more for vicinal dihalides with aqueous acid. Wait, no, KOH is a base, so perhaps it's elimination, not epoxide formation. So maybe I'm stuck on this first product.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a ketone. Let me imagine that. If the 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice, perhaps the two adjacent Brs are eliminated, forming a carbonyl group. Wait, no, that would require each Br to be replaced by an O group, which isn't straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the structure rearranges, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. Then, product 1 is 1,3-diene adamantane. Then, the IR peak at 1720 doesn't make sense. So maybe that's not correct.

Wait, maybe the initial product isn't an alkene but a carbonyl. How? Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is on adjacent carbons, maybe each Br is removed, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. But that would require two eliminations, each producing a carbonyl group. That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. But how? Maybe if a Br is removed, and the adjacent hydrogen is abstracted by the base, leading to formation of a carbonyl. Wait, maybe that's possible.

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the base causes an oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But for vicinal dihalides, substitution is less likely than elimination. So I'm going in circles here.

Maybe I should move on to the next steps and see if that helps. So, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. As I thought before, this could be a Friedel-Crafts reaction. So if product 1 is an alkene, perhaps it's used to form a cyclohexane ring via some addition, but I'm not sure.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into smaller carbonyl-containing fragments.

Looking at the product 3's 1H NMR: we're supposed to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with solvent. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone or has a conjugated carbonyl group. The most deshielded proton would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

Hmm, but let me try to reconstruct the entire pathway.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Assuming elimination, product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene. Then, product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe this is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but adamantadiene isn't an aromatic compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diene undergoing some kind of cyclization or addition.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a diol. If KOH causes the dihalide to substitute both Br atoms with OH, giving a 1,3-diol. Then, product 1 is 1,3-adamantane diol. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps this diol undergoes some kind of dehydration to form a diene or a cyclic ether. Or maybe it's a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid. If product 1 is a diol, the Lewis acid could catalyze its dehydration to form an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the alkene into two carbonyl groups.

Let me try that path. So:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → 1,3-adamantane diol (product 1). Wait, but the IR has 1720 cm-1, which isn't a diol's O-H stretch. Diol IR would have broad peaks around 3300. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe the initial product is an epoxide. Then, treating it with Al(OiPr)3 could cause ring-opening. But epoxide ring-opening usually needs acid, and Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. So product 2 could be an alcohol or something else.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let's say that 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts via elimination to form a ketone. How? If two adjacent Brs are eliminated, perhaps forming a carbonyl.

Wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Brs on adjacent carbons. If both Brs are eliminated, perhaps as HBr, but that would require two eliminations. Wait, elimination would require a β-hydrogen. Hmm, for each Br, maybe elimination would form a double bond, but how would that form a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a conjugated diene, which upon treatment with Al(OiPr)3 undergoes some addition or cyclization.

Wait, perhaps the first step is elimination to form an alkene, then product 2 is an addition product from Al(OiPr)3. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a ketone. Let's imagine that. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diketone. But how? Maybe via oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps a double elimination, but I don't see the mechanism.

Wait, another approach: look at the NMR of product 1. The NMR shows signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Let's think about what this could be.

The 4.79 ppm is likely a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. For example, an ether or a carbonyl group. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 near an electronegative group, perhaps adjacent to the 4.79 group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be a series of CH2 groups in a ring, perhaps part of an adamantane structure.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, the CH2 next to the oxygen would show up around 4 ppm. So the 4.79 (2H) might be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen in an epoxide. Then, the rest are the ring CH2 groups.

So product 1 could be 1,3-epoxyadamantane. How? Because 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with a base, could form an epoxide. Wait, but normally epoxides are formed from diols, not dihalides. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile. Wait, but the reaction is heating with KOH, which is a strong base.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of the dihalide to form an epoxide. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double substitution, but with KOH, which is a strong base, I think elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a ketone. But how?

Wait, maybe the structure of product 1 is a cyclopropane, but that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR of product 1. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a ketone or ester group.

So, the product 1 is a diketone? Then, 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, the NMR would show the ketone's neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, but a diketone would have two carbonyl groups. How would the NMR look? There would be two sets of CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls, possibly appearing around 2.5 ppm. The 4.79 may not fit here. Alternatively, the 4.79 could be something else, perhaps an oxygen-bearing CH2.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a geminal diol, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination, forms a conjugated diene, which then undergoes some reaction to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone and a double bond, making the molecule a diketene or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is not elimination but substitution. Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, forming a diol. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, it could cause dehydration to form a double bond. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would be a diketone.

In that case, the NMR of product 3 would show the carbonyl-adjacent CH groups.

But wait, the problem says that the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR is the one we're considering. The most deshielded would likely be next to a carbonyl group.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each carbonyl group is formed. So, in product 3, the structure would have two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to CH2 groups.

So, the NMR would show signals for the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls. Let's say each carbonyl is at the end of a chain. Then, the CH2 groups adjacent would be deshielded, perhaps as triplets due to coupling with neighboring groups.

Wait, but if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl group, the two protons would be equivalent and split into a triplet if coupled with another CH2 group.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl and then perhaps connected to another CH2, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, in ozonolysis, the alkene is cleaved, and each end becomes a carbonyl. So, if the alkene was between two CH2 groups, each would become a CH2 connected to a carbonyl. So each of those CH2 groups would have two protons each. The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the adjacent CH2 groups.

For example, suppose the structure after ozonolysis is (CH2)C=O and O=C(CH2). Wait, no, the ozonolysis of a diene would give something else.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, say 1,3-diene. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond, but wait, 1,3-diene would have two double bonds? No, a 1,3-diene would have a conjugated diene with one double bond spanning carbons 1-2 and 3-4? No, wait, that's not possible. Oh, wait, 1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene.

Wait, ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would typically cleave each double bond, but I'm not exactly sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is a single double bond, and ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a mono-alkene, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is a mono-alkene, like 1,3-adamantadiene (a single double bond between carbons 1 and 3), ozonolysis would break that into two fragments with carbonyl groups.

But in any case, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be next to a carbonyl group. The splitting would depend on neighboring protons.

In the NMR of product 3, each CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl would have two protons. These would couple with the adjacent CH2 groups.

Assuming that each CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2, the coupling would be a triplet due to the two neighboring protons.

Wait, but if each CH2 is next to another CH2 which is next to another group, the splitting could be more complex. Let me think: the CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's call this CH2A) is adjacent to another CH2 (CH2B). The protons on CH2A would be split by the two protons on CH2B, leading to a triplet. Alternatively, if CH2A is next to CH2B, which is next to another CH2 (CH2C), then the splitting could be higher order.

But in product 3, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is at the end of a chain, each connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group. So, for example, structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-O-C=O. Wait, but that would require the ozonolysis to form two ketones connected by a two-carbon chain.

In that case, each CH2 group near the carbonyl (positions 2 and 3) would have two protons. The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl (position 2) would be split by the adjacent CH2 (position 3), which has two protons. So each proton on position 2 would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But wait, position 2's protons are equivalent, and they couple with position 3's two protons. So each H in position 2 would be a triplet. Similarly, the protons in position 3 would couple with the position 2's two protons and perhaps any other neighboring protons, but if position 3 is at the end, then they might only be coupled to position 2's two protons, making them triplets as well.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. The deshielding would be greatest for the protons closest to the carbonyl groups. So the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be the most deshielded.

So their coupling would be a triplet. Looking at the options, option A is triplet. But wait, the options also include triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some branching or another coupling partner. If each of the CH2 groups is adjacent to more than one set of protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another thought: if the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl is also adjacent to another CH2 group which is in turn adjacent to another CH2 group, then the splitting could be a triplet of triplets. For example, each proton on CH2A couples with two protons on CH2B, and each proton on CH2B couples with two protons on CH2C. So the CH2A's protons would be a triplet (from CH2B), and CH2B's protons would be a triplet of triplets (from both CH2A and CH2C). But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH2 is only adjacent to one other CH2, then it's a simple triplet.

So, considering all this, the most deshielded protons in product 3 would be the ones next to the carbonyl groups, likely appearing as triplets due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group.

Therefore, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C likely results in an elimination reaction (E2 mechanism), forming 1,3-adamantadiene (product 1). The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the initial assumption of forming a diene might be incorrect. Instead, the reaction could involve the formation of a ketone or another carbonyl-containing compound.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid. This step likely involves a Friedel-Crafts-like reaction or dehydration, forming product 2. If product 1 is a diol, this step would dehydrate it to form an alkene. If product 1 is a ketone, this step might lead to further functionalization.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl compounds. If product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl-containing fragments, forming product 3.

4. **¹H NMR of Product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons. If the hydrogen is adjacent to a CH₂ group with two protons, it would appear as a triplet. If there are additional couplings, the pattern could become more complex (e.g., triplet of triplets or doublet of triplets). However, based on the analysis, the simplest coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen is a triplet.

**Conclusion**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a coupling pattern of a triplet.
