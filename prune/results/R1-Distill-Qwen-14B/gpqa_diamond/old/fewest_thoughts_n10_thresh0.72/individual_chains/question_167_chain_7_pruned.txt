Okay, so I have this question here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The state given is |ψ> = (cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>)/N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant, right? The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) * exp(-2α²)). 

The problem asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) when φ is -π/4 and alpha is 0.5. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which include coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's definitely non-Gaussian. But the question is about measuring how non-Gaussian it is using relative entropy.

The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is given by del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the state in question. Wait, wait, actually, isn't the relative entropy of distinguishability sometimes written as S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho - rho ln tau)? Oh wait, that's the formula I'm thinking of. But here, the del_b is given as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Hmm. That doesn't look like the standard relative entropy, which is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). So perhaps in this case, del_b is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau. Or maybe it's the mutual information? I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I can proceed.

Wait, the question says it's the relative entropy measure, so perhaps del_b is the relative entropy between rho and a Gaussian state. But the way it's written, trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) would actually be the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau. Because the entropy of a state rho is S(rho)
