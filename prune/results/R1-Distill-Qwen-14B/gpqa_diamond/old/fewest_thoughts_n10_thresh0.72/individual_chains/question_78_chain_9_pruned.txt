Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The setup is a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at a point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The charge's velocity at that time tr is v. We need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr.

I remember that potentials are generally solutions to Maxwell's equations. For static charges, the scalar potential is straightforward, but when charges move, things get more complicated because you have to consider the retarded time and possibly the motion of the charge.

Wait, the retarded time concept... Oh right, in electrodynamics, when you have a time-varying charge distribution, the fields at a point depend on the state of the charges at an earlier time (tr). That's the retarded time. So the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at that earlier time.

The scalar potential V for a static charge is (1/(4πε₀)) q/r. But for a moving charge, I think the expression changes due to the motion. Or wait, maybe not the scalar potential itself but how it's expressed when considering the retarded time.

Wait, no—the scalar potential for a moving charge in the static approximation might still look similar, but perhaps the vector potential comes into play when considering the dynamics.

Wait, let me think. The scalar potential is given by the Coulomb potential, but when the charge is moving, we have to use the Lienard potentials. Oh right, the Liénard potentials describe the fields due to an accelerated charge.

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(r' - (v·r')/(c²) + (v²)/(2c²)))] or something like that. Or more precisely, V is (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(r - (v t_r)/c²)] or similar. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, in terms of the vector d, which is from the source point (at time tr) to the observation point r. So d is the vector between the
