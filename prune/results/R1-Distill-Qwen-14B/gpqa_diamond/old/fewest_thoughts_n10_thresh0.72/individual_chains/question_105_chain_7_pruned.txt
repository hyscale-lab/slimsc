Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it out.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it compares to the signal from an exoplanet. Hmm. So the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They mention that photometric observations would show brightness variations due to rotation, which can mimic an exoplanet transit. But the question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that produces the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star?

Oh right, when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. So the goal is to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip caused by the planet is equal in amplitude to the dip caused by the star's spots.

Wait, but the spots are not uniformly covering the star. They are on one hemisphere. So the brightness variation comes from the star's spots rotating into and out of view. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star's overall brightness is lower than when the other hemisphere is visible.

I think I should model the brightness variation caused by the spots and set that equal to the variation from the planet transit, then solve for Rpl/Rstar.

Let's break it down.

First, the star's total brightness without any spots would be L = 4πRstar²σTeff^4. But when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, so the total brightness changes.

The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Here, it's 20%, so 0.2. Each spot is cooler by 1000 K, so the spot temperature is 5000 K.

Wait, no, the temperature difference is 1000 K. Does that mean the spots are 5000 K or 6000 K minus 1000 K? I think it's 5000 K because the star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So spots are at 5000 K.

So the total brightness when a hemisphere is covered with spots would be the star's normal flux minus the flux lost due to the spots plus the flux from the cooler regions.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star's surface has some parts (spots) at a lower temperature. The total luminosity is the sum of all the surface elements' contributions.

Without spots, L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But with spots, the spots contribute less. The filling factor is 0.2, so 20% of the surface is spots. So the total luminosity with spots is L = (1 - f) * L_unspotted + f * L_spots, where f is 0.2.
