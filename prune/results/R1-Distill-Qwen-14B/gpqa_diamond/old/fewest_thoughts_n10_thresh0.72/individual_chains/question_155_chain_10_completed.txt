Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z for a given quantum state. Let's start by recalling what I know about uncertainties and quantum operators.

First, the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). Here, A is the operator in question, which in this case is P_z.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So, I need to compute the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, and then plug them into the uncertainty formula.

Wait, but to compute these expectations, I need to know how P_z operates on the given state. Let me look at the matrix form of P_z. The matrix is diagonal, right? Let me write it out:

P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. That makes sense because P_z is diagonal in its eigenbasis, which is given as the basis of the problem.

The state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me check if this state is normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Compute: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. So it's normalized. Good.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Since P_z is diagonal, this is the same as the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z.

So let's compute each term:

First component: (-1/2)^2 * ħ = (1/4) ħ.

Second component: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0.

Third component: (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Adding these together: (1/4)ħ + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. Oh, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Next, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will have the squares of the diagonal elements.

So P_z² is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0;
  0, 0, 0;
  0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ², 0, 0;
  0, 0, 0;
  0, 0, ħ² ]

Wait, is that right? Because each element is squared. Yes, because (P_z)^2 = P_z * P_z, and since P_z is diagonal, each diagonal element squares.

So now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z squared.

So:

First component: (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

Second component: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0.

Third component: (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

Adding these: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (ħ²)/2.

Now, putting it into the uncertainty formula:

ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which is what I got. So the answer should be option B.

Hold on, let me think again. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations?

Wait a second, the given state is an eigenstate of P_x, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh, right, because the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis, which is correct for the calculation we did.

So computing the expectation values as I did is appropriate.

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is ħ/sqrt(2), so option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The given state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix},
\]

and the matrix form of $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
Since $P_z$ is diagonal, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 P_z^{(i)},
\]

where $c_i$ are the components of $|\psi\rangle$ and $P_z^{(i)}$ are the diagonal elements of $P_z$. Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 (P_z^2)^{(i)}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
