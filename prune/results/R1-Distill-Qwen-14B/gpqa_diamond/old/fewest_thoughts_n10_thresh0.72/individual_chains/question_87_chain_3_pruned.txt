Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Hmm, first, let me break down the information. A di-substituted aromatic ring means there are two substituents on a benzene ring. It's a 6-membered ring, so benzene is the base. The total carbon count is 8, which includes the benzene (6 carbons) and the substituents. So the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Wait, but wait, each substituent is attached to the ring, so maybe each substituent is one carbon group? Or maybe one is two carbons and the other is zero? No, that doesn't make sense because a substituent can't be zero. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a single carbon and the other is another group. Let me think: 6 (benzene) + substituent carbons = 8, so substituent carbons total 2. So perhaps each substituent is one carbon, but that would make two substituents each with one carbon. Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero, but that's not possible because substituents have to be attached. Wait, maybe the substituents are like -OCH3 or something. No, wait another approach.

Wait, the substituents can be groups that have more than one carbon. Let's think: the two substituents could be, for example, a carbonyl group and another group. But what's the structure here?

The IR shows a carbonyl (C=O) peak, which suggests a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so one of the substituents is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.), and another is a carbonyl group.

So the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a halogen (Cl, Br, I) and another is a carbonyl-containing group. Let me think about possible substituents. For example, one could be a hal
