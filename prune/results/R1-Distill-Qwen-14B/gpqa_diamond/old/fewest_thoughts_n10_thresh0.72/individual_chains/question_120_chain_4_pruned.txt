Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right! Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) is approximately 1 over parallax, like d = 1/plx, where plx is in parsecs and d is also in parsecs. But wait, I think it's d ≈ 1 / plx for small angles in parsecs. Right, because the parallax in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (so per unit plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws like 1/plx^1, 1/plx^2, etc. So I need to find the relationship between the number of stars and the range of parallax.

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Does that mean their positions are uniform in space, or just on the celestial sphere? I think it's uniform in space. So number density is uniform. Let me think about how that translates into parallax.

The number of stars in a certain volume depends on how that volume relates to parallax. Because parallax relates to distance, we can model this in 3D space. Let's imagine a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of this shell is 4πd² dr. But since parallax plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dr = - (dr/dplx) dplx. Wait, I should express everything in terms of plx.

If d = 1/plx, then dr = derivative of d with respect to plx times dplx. Let me compute that. dr = d/dplx (1/plx) dplx = (-1/plx²) dplx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since plx decreases as d increases, when plx increases, d decreases.

The number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to the volume of the shell times the number density. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So the number of stars N in a shell is N = n (4π d² dr), where n is the number density.

Substituting dr
