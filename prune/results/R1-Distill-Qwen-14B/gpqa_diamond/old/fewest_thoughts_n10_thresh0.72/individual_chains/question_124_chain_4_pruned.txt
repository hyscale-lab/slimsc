Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking: What Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls?

Hmm. So I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime as measured in the lab frame. Because if they're moving quickly, they might decay before reaching the wall. But wait, wait, no, the problem says they are fast-decaying particles, so maybe their lifetime determines how far they can travel before decaying.

Wait, right. The idea is that the particles are produced at the center of the detector. They need to travel from the center to the inner wall, which is 30 meters away. If the particle's lifetime is such that, under a certain Lorentz factor, only a third reach the wall when the Lorentz factor is 20. We need to find the Lorentz factor that allows two-thirds to reach the wall.

Wait, but the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so we can approximate their speed as the speed of light, right? So the time it takes for them to reach the wall is roughly the distance divided by the speed of light. Let's compute that.

The radius is
