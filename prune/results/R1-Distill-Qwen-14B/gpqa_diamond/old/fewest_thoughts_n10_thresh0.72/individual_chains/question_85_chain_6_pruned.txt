Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star's properties are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

Wait, the next part talks about the Doppler shifts. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. But I'm not sure how this directly relates to the temperature. Oh, right, the Doppler shift is used in the radial velocity method to detect planets. The shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. So a larger shift would mean a larger velocity, which might tie into the mass or orbital period of the planet.

But the question is about equilibrium temperatures. The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula I remember is:

Te = [ ( L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π² * σ
