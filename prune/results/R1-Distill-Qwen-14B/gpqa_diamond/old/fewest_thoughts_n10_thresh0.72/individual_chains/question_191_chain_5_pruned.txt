Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So the cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so a -CH(OH)CH3 maybe?), wait no, wait. Wait, hydroxymethyl is -CH2OH. Oh, no, wait, the formula is 3-(hydroxymethyl), so that's a -CH2OH group at position 3. And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The group is prop-1-en-2-yl, which would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2. So wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- attached where? Wait, the substituent is attached to the cyclohexane at the 2 position of the propene. Oh wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but attached at the middle carbon. Wait, maybe it's the structure where the substituent is CH2-C=CH2, but attached via the middle carbon. So the group is CH2-C(CH2-... Hmm, actually, maybe it's isopropenyl. Because prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH2-) something. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, maybe it's the same as isopropenyl group. So, the substituent at position 5 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=CH-CH2- but attached at the second carbon. Wait, no, perhaps it's (CH2)CH2 with a double bond. Maybe it's (CH2)CH–CH2, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to a methyl. Like CH2=CH-CH2- attached at the middle carbon? Wait, maybe I should just proceed, because sometimes the exact structure isn't the first thing to determine, but the reaction steps.

So the first step is treatment with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used to deprotonate things, especially in alkylation reactions. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent, usually an SN2 reagent. So probably, the OH in the starting material is being deprotonated by sodium hydride, turning into an oxide, which then attacks benzyl bromide in an alkylation.

Looking at the starting molecule, I see a hydroxymethyl group. So position 3 has a -CH2OH group. Sodium hydride would deprotonate

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is. It's about a series of reactions starting with a specific compound, and I need to figure out the final product. Hmm, I remember that each step involves a different reaction, so I'll need to go through each step carefully.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexanone with a ketone at position 1. Then, position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a substituent where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 2. So the prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2–C(CH2–)–, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–CH2– but with a substituent on the second carbon. Wait, no, the structure is CH2–C(=CH2)–, perhaps? Let me think. Prop-1-en-2-yl group is actually (CH2)C=CH2. No, wait, perhaps it's the group that's CH2–CH(CH2–) with a double bond. Hmm, maybe I should draw this.

Wait, the structure of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let's think:

Cyclohexanone with the ketone at position 1. Then, position 3 is a hydroxymethyl (–CH2OH), and position 5 is a propenyl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–CH2–CH2 group with the double bond between 1 and 2, but the substituent is on carbon 2. Wait, no. Prop-1-en-
