Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. They mentioned constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the arrangement of atoms, like different connectivity, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, let me tackle part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which of these doesn't undergo tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different tautomers, like between a keto form and an enol form. For tautomerism to occur, there should be a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. Because when that happens, the hydrogen can shift, causing the carbonyl to move.

Benzoquinone is a di- or para-quinone. Wait, benzoquinone can be either 1,2 (ortho) or 1,4 (para). I think para-benzoquinone is more common. The structure has two carbonyl groups (or ketone groups) on the benzene ring. Wait no, benzoquinone is actually a ring with two ketone groups, but connected in a way that they're conjugated. Wait, no, benzoquinone is an aromatic compound where two oxygen atoms are part of the ring. Oh wait, no, maybe it's a cyclohexadienedione? Or perhaps I'm getting it mixed up.

Wait, benzoquinone has the structure where a benzene ring is connected to two ketone groups. No, wait, quinones are typically cyclohexadienedione structures. Oh wait, no, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in the ring, making it a quinone structure. For example, 1,4-benzoquinone has two ketone groups at opposite positions on the benzene ring. So the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. So in the case of para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygens attached, each as carbonyl groups. So the structure is similar to two ketones on the benzene ring, para to each other.

Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is attached to the benzene ring. The ring is conjugated, so maybe the adjacent carbons are connected to other carbonyls or to the ring. Let me think: for tautomerism, a hydrogen must be alpha to the carbonyl. So if the adjacent carbon to the carbonyl has a hydrogen, then tautomerism is possible. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to the benzene, which is a ring. So each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the aromatic ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are probably part of the ring, which doesn't have hydrogens attached because they're part of double bonds in the ring. Wait, no: in the structure of para-benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4, and the adjacent positions are 2 and 3, which are part of the conjugated double bonds. So each carbonyl is at a position where the adjacent carbons are double-bonded to other carbons in the ring. So, the carbons next to the carbonyls don't have hydrogens because they're in a conjugated double bond system. So no hydrogens are alpha to the carbonyl groups in benzoquinone. Therefore, tautomerism isn't possible because there's no H to shift. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait another thing. Benzoquinone is also a dienophile, like in Diels-Alder reactions, but that's about reactivity, not tautomerism. So back to the point: without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism can't occur. So benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism.

Looking at the other compound: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the ring is 1,3,5-tricyclohexanone. Each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. Wait, no, in a cyclohexane ring, each position is a carbon. So in 1,3,5-trione, each of those positions has a carbonyl group. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-C around the ring.

Wait, actually, the structure would be more like a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at alternating positions. So each of those carbons (1,3,5) has a carbonyl group. For each of these carbonyls, the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6, 4 and 2, etc.) would have CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are CH2, meaning they have two hydrogens each. So, each carbonyl is next to a CH2 group, which has hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl. So tautomerism could occur here. Because each carbonyl has adjacent hydrogens, so the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism.

So part A is which doesn't show tautomerism. So the answer would be benzoquinone (A) is the one that doesn't show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. So for part A, the answer is benzoquinone is A.

Wait, the question says: among the two, which does not show tautomerism. So if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, then the one that doesn't is benzoquinone. So part A is: A is benzoquinone.

Now, part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning a carbon with four different substituents. Alternatively, it can arise from other forms of asymmetry, like in allenes or certain stereoisomer arrangements.

Let me look at each compound.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is: it's an ester. The formula is CH3CO-O-CH2OH? Wait, wait. Let me write it. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be (CH3)CO-OH, but wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would have the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to CH2-CH2-OH. So the carbonyl is on the end, then two CH2 groups, each with a hydroxyl on the second. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but the actual structure is:

The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CHOHCOOH? No, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is HOCH2CH2COOH. So when esterified, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is O
          ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-OH

No, wait, the structure would be O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH2CH2OH group. So the ester would be (CH2CH2OH)COOCH3, but wait, the 2-hydroxy is on the second carbon of the propanoate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. 2-hydroxypropanoate is: the carboxylic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when esterified, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is: the ester group is O=C-O-CH3, connected to CH2-CH2-OH. So the carbonyl is at position 1, the adjacent is CH2-OH at position 2, and CH2-OH at position 3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-OH

Wait, no, the carboxylic part is the end. So the structure is: O=C-OCH3 connected to CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the ester group is on the end, and the two adjacent carbons are each CH2 groups, with a hydroxyl on the second carbon.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no: wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl on the middle CH2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, in that structure, the central carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- One CH2(OH),
- One CH2COOCH3,
- Two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

The carbonyl is at position 1, then a CH2 group at position 2, which has a hydroxyl, and another CH2 at position 3? No, wait, I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The molecule is (HOCH2)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is: COOCH3 attached to CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, no, perhaps it's COOCH3 connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(OH) group. So the ester is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

No, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should think about the central carbon.

Looking for chiral centers, which are carbons attached to four different groups. So in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (position 2) would be connected to:

- One hydroxyl group (OH)
- Two CH2 groups (one adjacent to the COOCH3, the other to another CH2)
Wait, perhaps not. Let me actually try to write the structure.

2-hydroxypropanoate ester is an ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Oh wait, no: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

The central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- One OH,
- Two CH2 groups (one leading to the COOCH3, the other leading to the CH2(OH)),
Wait, no. Let me number the carbons from the COOCH3 end.

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2.

Carbon 3: CH2(OH).

Wait, maybe it's:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2 (connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3).

Carbon 3: CH2(OH).

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (COOCH3),
- Carbon 3 (CH2OH),
- Two CH2 groups? No, wait, wait: each carbon is connected to four bonds. Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (COOCH3),
- Carbon 3 (CH2OH),
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, that can't be right. No, each carbon must have four bonds. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

In this case, the middle CH2 is attached to two CH2 groups. So carbon 2 is CH2, attached to:

- Carbon 1 (OH),
- Carbon 3 (CH2),
- Two H's.

Wait, that would mean carbon 2 is CH2, which is symmetrical, so it can't be a chiral center. Because it's attached to two same groups (CH2 groups), so any possibility of chirality?

Wait, in this structure, the COOCH3 is on the end, followed by a CH2, then another CH2 with OH. So the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

So the central CH2 (carbon 2) is between two CH2 groups? No, perhaps Carbon 2 is CH2 between carbon 1 (COOCH3) and carbon 3 (CH2OH).

In this case, carbon 2 would have:

- COOCH3 (attached to carbon 1),
- CH2OH (attached to carbon 3),
- Two H's.

Wait, so carbon 2 is CH2, but in that case, it's not a chiral center because it has two identical groups (the two H's). So carbon 2 can't be a chiral center.

Wait, but maybe that's not the case. Let me think again. The structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH2-CH2-OH.

So the central CH2 is attached to the COOCH3 on one side and another CH2 on the other. That CH2 is attached to the OH group.

Wait, but in that case, the central CH2 (carbon 2) is connected to:

- COOCH3 (on one side),
- CH2-OH (on the other side),
- And two H's.

So, substituents on carbon 2: COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H.

Wait, that would mean carbon 2 is CH2, with two H's, so it's not a chiral center. So the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, hence no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought maybe the OH is on the second carbon. So perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate, perhaps.

Wait, wait, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is (CH2CH2O)O-C-OCH3, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the formula.

2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2-OH.

Wait, no, the order is O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2 group with OH.

So the chain is: O=C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2-OH.

In this case, the central CH2 (the one between the COOCH3 and the CH2OH) has:

- One bond to COOCH3,
- One bond to CH2OH,
- Two bonds to H.

So substituents are: COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So the central carbon isn't a chiral center because two of the substituents are same (H's), so no optical isomerism in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the hydroxyl is on a different carbon. Let me think again. Maybe the structure is:

The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the middle CH2 has:

- One OH,
- One CH2COOCH3,
- And two H's.

Wait, but that would make the middle CH2 have substituents: OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So again, two H's, so no chiral center.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center; thus, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Now, let's look at dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with a trans double bond. So fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, that's maleic acid. Fumaric acid is (E) HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, the structure is:

The double bond is between the two CH groups, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CO-OCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH? No, no, wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E) HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, the two carboxylic acid groups become COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Let me get the structure right.

Fumaric acid structure: it's 2-butenedioic acid, with the trans configuration. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH in a cis arrangement? No, no, wait: fumaric acid is an (E) isomer of butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester. Each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CHCOOCH3, but in the (E) configuration.

So the molecule is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CH2
|     |
COOCH3

Wait, no. No, the structure is:

O
|| 
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH group, which is double bonded to another CH group, which is connected to another O-C-OCH3.

So the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, wait, fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl ester would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3). No, that can't be right because the double bond is between the two CH groups.

So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, the correct structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)=CH-CH2(COOCH3)? No, that's not right either.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. No, that's not correct. Let me think differently.

In fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are on either end of the double bond, and their substituents are on opposite sides. So when esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, that doesn't look right because the double bond is between the two CH groups, each attached to COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3?

No, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond (CH=CH), with each CH attached to a COOCH3 group on one side and a CH3 on the other? No.

Alternatively, it's (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So each of the CH groups in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group attached. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that would have a double bond between the two CH groups, each connected to COOCH3. So structure is O
                        ||
O-C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH=CH - CH2 - O-C-OCH3.

No, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is O
                        ||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, which is connected via a double bond to another CH2 group, which is attached to O-C-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's not correct because that would be a single bond, not a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I'm not visualizing it correctly. Let me look it up mentally. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, that's maleic acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the structure is two COOH groups on either end of a double bond, with the substituents (in this case, the COOH groups) on opposite sides.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester of fumaric acid. So each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the double bond is between the two CH groups, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is:

HOOC
   \
CH2=CH
   /
COOH

Wait, no, that's not correct. Fumaric acid is (E) configuration, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides. So the structure is:

COOH
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOH

No, that's not right either. I think I'm getting stuck because I can't visualize it. Let me think about the double bond. Fumaric acid has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with COOH groups on carbons 1 and 4.

So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2.

Wait, no, that's maleic acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, meaning the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2.

Wait, no, wait, but no. Let me confirm: butenedioic acid can be either cis (fumaric) or trans (maleic). Wait, actually, maleic acid is cis, and fumaric acid is trans. So the structure of fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

So the structure is: 

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that would make it maleic acid. No, wait, no. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the two COOH groups are on the same side, but wait, no, E means opposite sides.

Wait, here's another approach. For butenedioic acid, the four-carbon chain has double bonds. The positions are 1,2; 2,3. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is the trans isomer. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, that would be a single bond. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of dimethyl fumarate as having a central double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. So the structure would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

In this structure, each of the CH groups in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. Wait, no, perhaps each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. No, I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O
                             ||
O-C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH=CH - CH2 - O-C-OCH3.

But that would be a single bond, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CH2
             |
             COOCH3

No, that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between CH and CH, each attached to COOCH3 and CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with COOCH3 groups attached to C1 and C4.

Wait, that can't be because the chain would be too long.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-CH2
             |
             COOCH3

But that's a four-carbon chain, but with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck and should move on. The key is that dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, which could lead to geometric isomerism (E/Z), but the question is about optical isomerism, which requires a chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

Wait, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it may not be chiral. Alternatively, if the molecule has a double bond with substituents on opposite sides, can that lead to optical isomerism?

Wait, no. Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which requires a chiral center (a carbon with four different substituents) or another form of asymmetry, like in allenes or certain ring structures. In this case, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, but the substituents on each end are the same. Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a methyl ester group. Let me think: if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule may not be chiral.

Wait, let's think: if the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, then each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Or perhaps each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, in any case, if the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus not be chiral. So, unless there's a chiral center elsewhere, the molecule wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of a chiral center in dimethyl fumarate. If the molecule has a carbon with four different groups attached, then it's chiral.

Wait, looking at the structure again, perhaps one of the carbons adjacent to the double bond has four different substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, that can't be right because I remember that fumarate esters can have cis and trans isomers, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong and dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center. So neither of the compounds would show optical isomerism. But that can't be the case because the question is asking which one does.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in the analysis of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me go back to that.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the OH is on the second carbon. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- One OH,
- One CH2COOCH3,
- Two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the central carbon (carbon 2) would be connected to:

- Carbon 1: which is CH2 (from the COOCH3),
- Carbon 3: which is CH2 (with OH),
- And two H's.

Wait, no, that's not possible because the central carbon would have four bonds. Let me re-express it. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that would make the central carbon a CH(OH), connected to:

- COOCH3,
- CH3,
- OH,
- and one more CH3? No, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3.

Wait, that would mean two CH3 groups attached to the same carbon, making it not a chiral center. So, the substituents would be: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and CH3. So two CH3 groups, so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so neither of the compounds would have optical isomerism. But that can't be right because the options suggest one of them does.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, because 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH2. So, it's attached to:

- Carbon 1: CH2COOCH3,
- Carbon 3: CH2OH,
- Two H's.

So substituents: COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H.

That would mean two H's, so no, no chiral center.

But wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe it's (R)- or (S)-configured, but without a chiral center, that's impossible.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake about the structure. Let me think again. Maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the structure where the central carbon is a CH connected to four different groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

In that case, the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- CH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because then two substituents are CH3, so it's not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group? Or another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)C(OH)COOCH3. No, that's a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is a three-carbon chain. So the middle carbon is attached to:

- CH2COOCH3,
- CH2OH,
- two H's.

So substituents are: CH2COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So again, two H's, so not a chiral center.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. I must be missing something. Let me think about dimethyl fumarate again.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond with substituents on either end. If the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, if the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), then each end of the double bond has a CH2COOCH3 group. But in this case, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. So it would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents on each end are different, then the molecule would have a chiral center. But if the substituents are the same, then it's symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Wait, so perhaps neither of the compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism, but that can't be the case because the question states that one of them does.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Maybe the structure is different. For example, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3.

Wait, no, that would have two CH3 groups, so it's not a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is different. Suppose the molecule is (R)- or (S)-configured because the central carbon is attached to four different groups. How?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH2COOCH3,
- CH2OH,
- H,
- and H.

No, that's two H's, so no.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong carbon. Let's think about the carbon attached to the OH. In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the OH is on the second carbon.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, so the second carbon is CH2, connected to:

- COOCH3,
- another CH2 (which is connected to OH),
- and two H's.

So substituents are COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So no, no chiral center.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possibility of another isomerism, like in the case of allenes. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the substituents.

Wait, another approach: which of the two compounds has a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's connected to three same substituents, then it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the OH is on a carbon with four different groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. In this case, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3.

Wait, no, that would mean two CH3 groups, so not four different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2OH)COOCH3, meaning the central carbon is CH2, but that's not a chiral center.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate also doesn't. But that can't be, as the options would suggest otherwise.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possibility that dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center elsewhere. For example, maybe the ester groups are on carbons that have four different substituents.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each ester group is on a CH2 group. So each of those CH2 groups is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two H's,
- and another CH2 group.

So substituents are: COOCH3, H, H, CH2 (from the double bond or the other side). So no, those are not chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the double bond is in a different position. Maybe the structure is such that one of the carbons in the double bond has four different substituents.

For example, if the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, that would make each end of the double bond have a COOCH3 group. So each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and another group.

Wait, perhaps in this structure, each CH in the double bond is attached to COOCH3, H, and two CH2 groups. No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Which one of the two compounds has a chiral center? 

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the central carbon (CH2) has two H's, so no chiral center.

Dimethyl fumarate: Let's think about the structure again. If the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), then each CH in the double bond has:

- COOCH3,
- a CH2 group,
- and a H.

Wait, perhaps in this case, each CH is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- CH2 group,
- H,
- and another CH2 group.

Wait, but that's still two CH2 groups, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, and neither does methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. But that can't be the case because the question says one of them shows optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Maybe its structure allows for a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the structure is (R)- or (S)-configured because the central carbon has four different substituents.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH2, connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2COOCH3,
- Carbon 3: CH2OH,
- Two H's.

So substituents are CH2COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So no, not a chiral center.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for alternative information or another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the possibility of enantiomers. So, if a molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: perhaps the molecule is in the form of a meso compound, which would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having stereocenters.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereocenters, thus no optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism, but methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does. But that contradicts my earlier analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part A. Let me ensure I didn't.

Part A: Which doesn't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: no alpha H's, so no tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: has alpha H's, so tautomerism occurs.

So part A: A is benzoquinone.

Part B: Which shows optical isomerism.

If methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, then it would show optical isomerism. But according to my analysis, it doesn't. Therefore, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does.

Wait, but I'm not seeing a chiral center in dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents that create a chiral center elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- CH2OH,
- two H's.

So substituents are COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So no, it's not chiral.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options to see which combination makes sense.

The options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

From earlier analysis, part A: A is benzoquinone. So options B and D are possible.

Part B: which shows optical isomerism.

If methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (option B's B) doesn't show optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate (option D's B) does, then the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggests that neither shows optical isomerism, which can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism because it has a chiral center. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in thinking that the substituents on the double bond are the same. If the substituents are different, then the molecule could have a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does, making option B the answer.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the carbonyl groups.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a ketone group. No, it's an ester. The structure is an ester, which is a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

The structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to CH2-CH2-OH.

In that case, the central CH2 is between the ester and the OH.

So the central carbon is CH2, with substituents:

- OCOOCH3 (from the ester),
- CH2OH,
- two H's.

So substituents: OCOOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So again, no chiral center.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is actually (R)- or (S)-configured because the structure is such that the central carbon has four different substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3 group.

No, that's two CH3 groups, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, but that would be a different compound.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

From what I've deduced:

Part A: Benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Part B: Dimethyl fumarate might have a double bond that allows for geometrical isomerism, but optical isomerism requires a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

But methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate also doesn't have a chiral center, so neither shows optical isomerism. But that can't be the case because the options suggest one does.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Maybe its structure allows for a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Let me count the substituents on the central carbon.

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3.

So two CH3 groups, so no, not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, attached to:

- COOCH3,
- CH2OH,
- two H's.

So substituents: COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. Again, no chiral center.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to proceed with what I have.

So part A: A is benzoquinone.

Part B: Which shows optical isomerism.

If neither shows it, but the options suggest one does, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center in one of its carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, where each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. If the substituents on each end are different, perhaps one of the carbons is a chiral center.

Wait, for example, if one CH is attached to COOCH3 and a CH2 group, and the other CH is attached to COOCH3 and a different group, perhaps it's a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the double bond are chiral centers.

Wait, I'm not seeing it. Maybe I should conclude that dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and hence no optical isomerism, while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate also doesn't. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Maybe the structure allows for a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. In this case, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3.

No, two CH3 groups, so no.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CO-O-CH2-OH. No, that's not correct.

I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll have to make a choice. Based on my earlier analysis, I think part A is benzoquinone, and part B is dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for other possibilities.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)=CH-COOCH3. So each end has a CH2COOCH3 group. Wait, no, that would be (E) configuration with substituents on each end.

Wait, perhaps each of the CH groups in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So each CH is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- CH2 group,
- H,
- and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps one of the carbons has four different substituents.

If one CH is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- CH2 group,
- H,
- and another CH2 group,

then it's not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbons has different substituents, making it a chiral center.

I think I'm stuck and need to proceed. Based on the options, the correct answer is D: A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the question.

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
1. **Benzoquinone**: Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group). Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring, but the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring and do not have hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls have hydrogens, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is attached to:
   - CH₃,
   - COOCH₃,
   - OH,
   - and another CH₃.
   Since two substituents (CH₃ groups) are identical, this carbon is not a chiral center, and the compound does not show optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂(COOCH₃)-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This compound has a double bond with two identical ester groups (COOCH₃) on opposite sides. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **neither compound shows optical isomerism**, but based on the options provided, the correct pairing is:

- **A = benzoquinone**
- **B = dimethyl fumarate**

---

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **D**.

**Answer: D**
