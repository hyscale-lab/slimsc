Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll walk through what I remember.

First, I think I need to draw the structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Cyclopentene would be a five-membered ring with one double bond. Since it's cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, right? Because the numbering starts at the oxygen. Wait, no, wait. Enol structure: the double bond is between the alpha and beta carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group. Oh wait, no, wait—enol is where the double bond is between the carbonyl carbon and the alpha carbon. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So cyclopentene ring with substituents. The 'enol' part suggests an alcohol adjacent to a carbonyl group. Wait, no, wait. Enol is a compound where the hydroxyl group (OH) is attached to a doubly bonded carbon, making it an enol (like an alcohol with adjacent double bond). So structure-wise, cyclopentene with an OH group on a carbon that's part of the double bond.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formula for enols is R2C=CH-OH? Or is it RCH2-C(OH)=CH2? Hmm. No, actually, enol is an alcohol with an adjacent double bond. So in a cyclopentene ring, the OH would be on a carbon that's part of the double bond, right? So the structure would be a cyclopentene ring where one of the double bond carbons has an OH group. And since it's 4,4-dimethyl, those methyl groups are on carbon 4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the ring. Let's number the ring. Carbon 1 is where the double bond starts. So, cyclopentene is a five-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents are on C4. So the structure is: C1 is part of the double bond (C1=C2), and C4 has two methyl groups.

So the enol has an OH on C1. So structure would be: cyclopentene ring, with C1-OH and C4 has two methyl groups. Wait, is that right? Or is the enol structure where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1? That would make it a cyclopentenol with the OH on the double bond carbon.

Wait, but enol is a tautomer of a ketone or aldehyde. So maybe the starting material is a ketone, and the enol form is formed. Alternatively, the starting material given is an enol, perhaps in equilibrium with a ketone.

Wait, but the question is about reacting with bromine. Bromine is typically a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions, but wait, here it's more about addition reactions.

Wait, when an enol reacts with bromine, what usually happens? Enols can undergo bromination. The reaction typically adds bromine across the double bond, leading to dibromide. But wait, because the enol is an alcohol, perhaps it's more about allylic bromination?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So it's a cyclopentene ring with an OH group on carbon 1 (the same as the double bond). So the structure is a ring with C1=C2, and C1 has an OH group. Then, C4 has two methyl groups attached.

When bromine (Br2) reacts with an enol, the reaction can proceed via different mechanisms. One possibility is that the double bond (C1-C2) is brominated. Since bromine is a diadduct, it would add across the double bond, forming a dibromide.

Wait, but the enol is a conjugated system, so the addition would be via the allylic position or maybe via some other way. Alternatively, it could be a dihalogenation. But wait, the starting material is an enol, and bromine might add to the double bond, but let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, considering that the enol is acidic, perhaps the OH would deprotonate, making a conjugate base. Then, the base could attack bromine. Wait, but Br2 is a dienophile. Or perhaps the enol would react via an electrophilic addition.

So, when you have an enol (like cyclopentenol), adding bromine would add across the double bond. The double bond between C1 and C2 would react with Br2, adding Br atoms to each end. So the product would have Br on C1 and Br on C2.

Wait, but the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So after adding Br2, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. But looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, and option D is (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Wait, so the reaction would add Br across the double bond. Then, the new structure would have Br on C1 and C2. So the product would be a diastereomer, depending on the addition.

Wait, but the starting material is an enol. When Br2 adds to a double bond, it's a dihalogenation. The addition is typically in a trans fashion because Br adds across the double bond with anti addition.

Wait, but wait—cyclopentene rings are small. The addition of Br2 would open the ring, but no, wait, no, the cyclopentene ring is five-membered. Adding Br2 across the double bond would form a dibromide without breaking the ring. So the ring remains intact, but with Br atoms on C1 and C2.

Wait, but in the starting material, the OH is in the ring. So after adding Br, the OH is now on C1, which has a Br, and C2 has a Br as well.

Wait, but in the options, the substituents are on C1 and C2 as Br, and the OH is on C1 as well. So the product would have OH and Br on C1, and Br on C2.

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and D have the two Brs on C1 and C2. So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Wait, but the options A and D are different in their stereochemistry. So the question is: what's the configuration of the Br atoms after the addition?

In the addition of Br2 to a double bond, the bromine atoms add with anti stereochemistry. So, for a trans double bond, the addition would lead to a cis dibromide? Or wait, no, the starting double bond is in a ring. Let's think about the geometry.

Wait, in a cyclopentene ring, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ring is planar around the double bond. So upon addition of Br2, each Br adds to opposite faces. So the two Br atoms will be on opposite sides of the ring, leading to a trans configuration.

But wait, in a five-membered ring, the addition of Br across the double bond would lead to a ring with Brs on adjacent carbons in a trans configuration. So in the product, the two Brs would be on C1 and C2 with trans stereochemistry.

But looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), which would be trans, because the OH is on C1 (R configuration) and Br on C2 (S). Option D is (1R,2R), which would be cis because both Brs are R configuration.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is an enol, which is in a certain configuration. The OH is on C1 adjacent to the double bond, so the enol is in a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has the OH in a specific position that affects the addition. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't a simple addition but something else. Wait, another possibility is that the enol could undergo bromination at the allylic position.

Wait, allylic bromination. So in the presence of a base like HOBr or using NBS (N-bromosuccinimide) with light, allylic bromination can occur. But here, the reagent is just Br2. Hmm.

Wait, the reaction of an enol with Br2 could lead to either addition across the double bond or possibly substitution at the allylic position.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. The options include some cyclopentanone derivatives as well.

Wait, some of the options are cyclopentanone derivatives. So maybe the initial enol reacts to form a ketone, and then a bromine adds elsewhere. But I thought the initial reaction of bromine with an enol would be addition to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive towards bromine because of the adjacent hydroxyl group. Maybe the OH acts as a nucleophile or something.

Wait, wait, another angle: if the enol is treated with bromine, which is a good electrophile, the conjugated system might allow for some kind of electrophilic attack. The enol has conjugated double bonds, so the alpha position could be susceptible to bromination.

Wait, but in this case, the double bond is part of the ring, so adding Br across the double bond would form a dibromide. Alternatively, the OH could get involved in a reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't with the double bond but the hydroxyl group. Maybe it's an acid-catalyzed process where the OH loses a proton, making the adjacent C more electrophilic, leading to bromine addition.

Alternatively, considering that enols can form ketones upon tautomerization, but I don't think that's the case here. Wait, but the product options include cyclopentanone derivatives. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a bromohydrination. But bromohydrination usually involves adding Br and OH across the double bond, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol reacts to form a carbocation, which would then be attacked by Br-.

Wait, but bromine is a diatomic molecule; in solution, it can generate Br+ and Br- radicals or ions. Wait, perhaps it's a radical mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let me think about the options. The options are:

A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

So, the options are either cyclopentanol with two Brs (A and D) or cyclopentanone with a single Br (B, C).

So, the reaction could either be adding Br to the double bond (leading to A or D) or substituting a hydrogen with Br in the ketone form.

Wait, wait, but the starting material is an enol. Enols can tautomerize to ketones. So if the enol converts to a ketone, then the ketone could undergo bromination, possibly at the alpha position.

Ah! That makes sense. So, the enol (4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol) can tautomerize to the ketone form, which would be 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, right? Because the enol tautomer is in equilibrium with the ketone. So when you add bromine, it would react with the ketone.

But wait, reacting a ketone with bromine—how? Bromine can react with ketones in a nucleophilic addition, but usually, that's when the ketone is under specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha bromination.

Wait, alpha bromination of ketones occurs under certain conditions, like in the presence of a base, using NBS, or via some radical mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: in the presence of a base, the enol could deprotonate to form an enolate, which then reacts with bromine. But in this case, the question is about the reaction with bromine, which is a dienophile, but maybe not.

Wait, but if the enol converts to the ketone, then the ketone can undergo bromination at the alpha position. So in 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, the alpha carbons are C2 and C5 (if the ketone is on C4). Wait, but the starting material is 4,4-dimethyl, so the ketone would be on C4? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, wait. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. That would tautomerize to cyclopentanone, but where would the ketone be?

In the enol form, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the ketone tautomer would have the carbonyl group on C1, with C2 being a single bond. So the structure would be a cyclopentanone with the carbonyl on C1, and C4 has two methyl groups.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because in a five-membered ring, the carbonyl would be on a specific position. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the ketone is on C3.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structures.

Enol form: cyclopentene ring with double bond between C1 and C2. OH is on C1.

So the enol structure is:

O
|
C1=C2 - C3 - C4 - C5 (with C4 having two methyl groups)

When it tautomerizes to the ketone, the OH moves to C2, and the double bond breaks. So the ketone would be on C1, so:

O=C1 - C2 - C3 - C4(CH3)2 - C5

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, that would make the structure a cyclopentanone with the carbonyl on C1.

So the ketone is 1-oxo-cyclopentane, but with substituents on C4.

Hmm, but in any case, the ketone would have alpha carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group. So maybe C2 and C5 are alpha carbons.

So reacting this ketone with bromine would typically lead to bromination at the alpha position. So, the alpha carbon (say C2) would have a Br added.

So the product would be 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the Br is added to C3, but that's not an alpha position. So the major product would likely be the alpha brominated ketone.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is an enol. So does bromine add to the double bond, or does the enol tautomerize to the ketone first, and then bromination occurs?

Which reaction is more favorable? I think that when an enol is treated with a reagent that reacts with both the enol and the ketone, the enol form would react faster. But bromine is a dienophile; wait, maybe it's about dienol reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an addition across the double bond. So, the enol has a conjugated double bond, and bromine adds to the double bond, leading to a vicinal dibromide.

But then the product would be a dibromide with the OH on C1 and Br on C1 and C2. That would be options A or D.

But why are there ketone products as options? Because perhaps the enol can tautomerize after addition.

Wait, but in the addition, the double bond would turn into a single bond with two Brs. So the ring would still have a hydroxyl group on C1, and Brs on C1 and C2.

But wait, in that case, the product would have three groups on C1: the OH, the Br, and two ring bonds. Wait, is that possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the addition of Br2 leads to the formation of a bromohydrin. But in that case, the OH and Br would be on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible products again.

If the reaction is an addition of Br2 to the double bond, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. The configuration of the Brs would depend on the addition.

Since the double bond is in a ring, the addition would likely be anti. So the Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring.

So the resulting molecule would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH on C1.

Looking at the options, A is (1R,2S) and D is (1R,2R). So which one is it?

Wait, the starting enol's configuration would influence the product's configuration. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Let's imagine the structure in a chair-like or boat-like conformation.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of chair conformations, but the ring is five-membered, so it's more like a boat or a puckered structure.

But for stereochemistry, the key is the configuration of the starting enol. The OH is on C1, which is part of the double bond.

In the enol form, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is C1-C2. So the substituents on C1 would be: the OH, the double bond to C2, and two ring bonds to C5 and C2.

Wait, perhaps the addition of Br2 forms a trans diastereomer.

Assuming the starting double bond is in a certain configuration (E or Z), but in a small ring like cyclopentene, the double bond is usually in a trans configuration because of the ring strain. Hmm, but cyclopentene is less strained than cyclopropane, so the double bond is typically cis.

Wait, no, I think in cyclopentene, the double bond is typically cis. Because in the five-membered ring, the substituents are on the same side to minimize strain.

Wait, if the double bond is cis, then adding Br2 would add the Brs on the same side, leading to a cis dibromide. But in a ring, same side would mean that the Brs are adjacent in a way that may not be possible due to ring structure.

Alternatively, considering the ring's planarity, the Brs would add across the double bond, leading to a trans arrangement in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the addition is not possible without some ring opening. But cyclopentene is a stable ring, so the addition would occur without opening.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diastereoselectivity. When Br2 adds to a double bond, it proceeds via a cyclic bromonium intermediate, leading to anti addition.

So in the case of the cyclopentene ring, the two Brs would add to opposite faces, leading to a trans configuration around the single bond.

So in the product, the Br on C1 and C2 would have opposite configurations.

Now, the starting material's configuration: the enol has an OH on C1. Let's imagine that the OH is on the same side as the methyl groups on C4.

Wait, but without the structure, it's a bit hard. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a specific configuration, but the options A and D have different configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a vicinal diol with Br, but no, I think Br adds as Br2.

Wait, another approach: the options for cyclopentanone suggest that the product is a ketone with a Br. So perhaps the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, and then alpha bromination occurs.

In the ketone form, the alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl. So for 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, the alpha carbons would be C2 and C5 (assuming the ketone is on C1). So if bromine adds to either C2 or C5, the product would be 2-bromo or 5-bromo.

But in the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, and option C is 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Wait, but in the ketone, the substituents are on C4. So if the Br is added to C2, that's the alpha position, which makes sense. So option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

But wait, why would the enol tautomerize to the ketone before reacting with bromine? Because the ketone is less reactive towards Br2 than the enol is.

Alternatively, maybe the bromine would react with the enol's double bond, adding Brs, but the presence of the OH group might lead to some reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could undergo an acid-catalyzed reaction where the OH is protonated, making the adjacent C more electrophilic, leading to attack by Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromohydrination, where Br and OH are added across the double bond. But that would produce a diol with Br and OH groups.

Wait, but the product options don't include that. So maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps the major product is the cyclopentanone with a Br added at the alpha position. So the answer would be option B.

But why would the enol tautomerize to the ketone before reacting with bromine? Enol and ketone are in equilibrium, but the reactivity might favor the ketone's reaction.

Wait, but in the presence of a base, the enol would be more prevalent. But if the reaction is with bromine, which is a dienophile, perhaps the enol would react faster.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds to the enol, leading to the formation of a diol with Br.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. But no, Br2 is not typically a conjugate base.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible mechanisms again.

Enol structure: cyclopentene ring with OH on C1 and double bond between C1 and C2. The other substituents are two methyl groups on C4.

When Br2 is added, the reaction is likely an electrophilic addition across the double bond. Since the enol is a conjugated diene, but wait, no, it's a single double bond.

So the addition would lead to Br on C1 and C2. So the product would have two Brs, leading to options A or D.

But why are options B and C present? Unless the reaction is leading to a ketone with a single Br.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is the addition of bromine to the double bond, making a diol with Brs. Then, the diol could tautomerize to a ketone, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another angle: the enol's double bond is more reactive than the ketone's. So the reaction would proceed via the enol, adding Br across the double bond.

But how does that lead to the ketone product options? It doesn't. So perhaps the reaction is not an addition but a substitution.

Wait, but where is the leaving group in the enol? The OH is on C1, but that's not a good leaving group unless it's activated.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a radical bromination. In that case, the most stable radical would form. But I don't know enough about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol reacts with bromine in a way that the OH group is involved. Maybe the OH is replaced by Br via some kind of substitution.

But that would require the OH to be a good leaving group, which it isn't typically. Unless under acidic conditions, but the question doesn't specify.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but that's with something like OsO4.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck on this. So perhaps I should look for a mnemonic or a rule of thumb. I remember that enols can undergo bromination at the alpha position when in the ketone form.

Wait, if the enol converts to the ketone, then the alpha position (C2) can undergo bromination. That would produce a brominated ketone, which is option B.

So, the reaction would involve the enol tautomerizing to the ketone, and then bromine adding to the alpha position.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the enol's double bond is more reactive, leading to dibromide addition, giving options A or D.

But the presence of the ketone options suggests that the product is a brominated ketone.

Wait, but how would bromine add to the alpha position without the enol tautomerizing first.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol doesn't react with bromine, and the reaction is with the ketone. But how would the enol convert to the ketone under these conditions.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when enols react with HBr, they typically add to the alpha position. But that's under specific conditions, like in the presence of acid.

But in this problem, the reagent is just bromine. So perhaps the reaction is not straightforward.

Alternatively, considering the possible products, and the most likely reaction, I think the enol would react with bromine via addition across the double bond, leading to a dibromide. So the product would be a diastereomer, either A or D.

Now, the question is about the major outcome. So which stereochemistry is more favorable.

In the addition of Br2 to a double bond in a ring, the stereochemistry of the addition depends on the starting material's geometry.

Wait, in a cyclopentene ring, the double bond is typically in a cis configuration because of the ring strain. So when Br adds across, it would add trans, leading to a cis or trans diastereomer in the product.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe thinking about the chair-like transition state, but perhaps it's better to look for the major product based on the options.

If the initial structure is cis, then the addition of Br would place the Brs on opposite faces, leading to (1R,2S) or (1S,2R) configurations. Looking at options A and D, option A is (1R,2S), which would be trans, and option D is (1R,2R), which is cis.

Wait, but in a five-membered ring, the trans addition would lead to a certain configuration. Maybe the major product is the trans diastereomer.

Alternatively, I'm not too confident, but perhaps the major product is option D, (1R,2R), if the addition leads to a cis configuration because of the ring's constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to retention of configuration, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, the dibromides (A and D) are cyclopentanol derivatives, while the others are ketones. So if the reaction adds Br across the double bond, the product is a diol with two Brs. But the enol is an alcohol, so the product would have OH on C1 and Brs on C1 and C2.

Wait, but that can't be because C1 can't have three substituents: OH, Br, and two ring bonds. Wait, no, in the ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons. So C1 would have an OH, a Br, and two single bonds to adjacent carbons. So that's possible.

So the product would have OH on C1, Br on C1 and C2. Wait, but that would mean C1 has two Brs? No, because Br adds across the double bond, each Br is on a different carbon.

Wait, no, each Br is on a different carbon. So C1 has OH and one Br, and C2 has one Br.

So the product is 1-bromo-2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol? Wait, that's not correct. Wait, each Br is on C1 and C2 respectively. So the structure would be 1-bromo-2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

So which configuration is more likely?

The addition of Br2 would lead to trans addition. So if the starting double bond is cis, the Brs will be on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration in the product.

But in a ring, the trans configuration might lead to a certain diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is the trans diastereomer, which would correspond to option A: (1R,2S).

But without knowing the exact configuration of the starting material, it's hard to be certain.

Alternatively, the enol could have a certain configuration that leads to a specific diastereomer upon bromine addition.

Wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the substituents on C4 are two methyl groups, which are bulky. This might influence the approach of Br2, leading to a certain stereochemistry.

But without knowing more, perhaps the best approach is to choose the option where the Brs are added in a trans fashion, leading to (1R,2S) configuration.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but another thought: the addition of Br2 to an enol could also lead to the formation of a bromohydrin. Wait, no, bromohydrin is when Br and OH are added across the double bond, but the starting material already has an OH on C1.

Wait, perhaps the OH attacks the Br2, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but that's not the case here.

I think I've spent enough time thinking, and I need to make a decision. Based on what I've thought, the major product is likely the dibromide with OH on C1 and Brs on C1 and C2.

Given the options, the dibromides are options A and D.

Assuming the addition is trans, the configuration would be (1R,2S), which is option A.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, if the starting material is such that the addition leads to (1R,2R), then option D would be correct.

But I think that the addition of Br2 would lead to a trans configuration, so the answer would be option A.

Wait, but another possibility: after adding Br across the double bond, the molecule can tautomerize to a ketone, but that's not mentioned in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is the ketone with a Br on C2, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Hmm. Let me think about what each option represents.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

So the starting enol would have to tautomerize to the ketone, and then Br adds to C2.

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

So the Brs are added across the double bond, and the OH remains.

So without more information, I think the correct answer is option B, because the ketone is a more stable structure and bromination would occur at the alpha position.


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br₂). The starting material is an enol, which is a compound with a hydroxyl group (OH) adjacent to a double bond. Enols are in equilibrium with their ketone tautomers, and the reaction conditions likely favor the ketone form for bromination.

When the enol tautomerizes to the ketone, the structure becomes 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. In the ketone form, the carbonyl group is at C1, with two methyl groups on C4. Bromination typically occurs at the alpha position (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), which are C2 and C5 in this case. The major product is therefore 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, as the alpha position at C2 is more reactive.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Option A** and **D** represent dibrominated cyclopentanol derivatives. These would result from bromine addition across the double bond in the enol form. However, the ketone is more likely to react under these conditions due to its greater stability and reactivity at the alpha position.
- **Option C** suggests bromination at C4, which is not an alpha position and is therefore unlikely.

Thus, the major outcome of the reaction is the formation of 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Answer: B
