Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of the compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's see, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a good starting point. 

Looking at the IR data first. The strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably N-H stretches because they’re in that region. Oh wait, but wait—those could also be from alcohols or amines. But the fact that there are two bands close together might suggest either amide N-H or maybe a secondary amine? No, wait, in amides the N-H is usually around 3300–3500, and if it's a primary amine, it might split into multiple bands. But I'm not too sure yet.

The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a big clue. That’s in the region for carbonyl groups. So maybe an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone? But the presence of O2 in the formula suggests it's not a ketone because that would only have one O. So likely an ester or an amide. 

Now let's look at the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm as a triplet integrating for 3H. Usually, a triplet around 1.2 ppm is indicative of a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded. Maybe an ester's ethyl group? Or perhaps part of a propyl chain.

Then there's a peak at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad singlet around 4 ppm makes me think of an N-H, but wait, the integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Oh wait, maybe an OCH2 group? Like in an ester, but I'm not sure.

The next peak is at 4.5 ppm, a quartet for 2H. Quartet usually suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe an OCH2CH2 group? Or an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen. So perhaps an ethyl ester where one CH2 is next to the oxygen and the other is attached to something else.

Then we have the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm as a doublet (d) for 2H, and 8.0 ppm as another doublet for 2H. This suggests a disubstituted benzene ring, probably para-substituted since the doublets are of similar integration (2H each). So like two substituents on opposite positions. So perhaps a group attached as para to another group, like OCH2CH2CO... something.

Putting this together, the aromatic protons being doublets suggests that they are next to substituents. So maybe a structure where the benzene ring has substituents in the para positions. For example, one substituent could be an amino group (NH2) and another an ester group (like OCO
