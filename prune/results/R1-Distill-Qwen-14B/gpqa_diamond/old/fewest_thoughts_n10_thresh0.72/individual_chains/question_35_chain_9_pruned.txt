Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, let's read the question again carefully.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, A_y. It's given by a 2x2 matrix A_y which is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h divided by 4π. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. And then determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct.

First, I remember that the eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues.

But wait, since A_y is c times S, maybe I can first find the eigenvalues of S and then multiply them by c to get the eigenvalues of A_y.

Let me write down the matrix S:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues of S, I'll compute the determinant of (S - λ I). So,

|S - λ I| = |(0-λ)   (-i)|
           |(i)    (0-λ)|

Which is ( -λ )^2 - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - (i * i*(-1))? Wait, let me compute that correctly.

The determinant should be (0-λ)(0-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - [ (-i)(i) ].

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1, so (-i)*i = -i^2 = 1.

So the determinant is λ² - (1) = 0.

Thus, λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of A_y = c*S are c*(+1) and c*(-1).

Given that c = h/(4π), so A_y's eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but the options mention things like 2πh and h/(4π). So let's compute.
