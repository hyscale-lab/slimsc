Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about a quasar's spectrum and figuring out its comoving distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question says that when observations are made in near-infrared and optical, there's a peak at about 790 nm. At shorter wavelengths than that, the flux drops a lot. Wait, what does that tell me? Oh right, I remember that the Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines blueward (i.e., shorter wavelength) of the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is at about 121 nm. But wait, the peak here is at 790 nm. Wait, that's longer than optical, right? Because optical is roughly 400-700 nm. So 790 is near-infrared.

Wait, but 790 nm is significantly redshifted from the rest wavelength if it's an emission line. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm. If that line is observed at a longer wavelength, that implies redshift. So if the observed wavelength is longer, the shift is z = (observed - rest)/rest. So for Lyman-alpha, say the observed wavelength is λ_obs. If the quasar is at a high redshift, the Lyman-alpha line would be redshifted into the optical or infrared.

Wait, wait, the problem says that the flux drops at wavelengths <790 nm. So perhaps the peak is at 790, which might be the Lyman-alpha line. So if the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm, then the observed wavelength is 790 nm. So z = (790 - 121.6)/121.6. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5. So 790/121.6 ≈ 6.5. So z is about 5.5? Because z = (λ_obs - λ_rest)/λ_rest, so (790-121.6)/121.6 = 668.4/121.6 ≈5.5. Wait, wait, no: 790 is the observed, which is longer. Wait, 790 is much longer than 1
