Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem states: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the mu(+) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the mu(+) and the neutrino from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since Pi is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the mu(+) and the neutrino should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me write down the given data:

Mass of Pi(+) = m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
Mass of mu(+) = m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
Mass of neutrino (assuming it's a neutrino, which is very light, but in reality, for pion decay, the neutrino is a muon neutrino, which has some mass but it's negligible compared to the other particles. Wait, but I think in this problem, since the neutrino's mass is not given, it's probably considered massless. Because for pion decay, the muon neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible, so treating it as massless might be the way to go here. Or maybe it's a different type of neutrino? Well, the problem doesn't specify, but I'll proceed with the given info.)

Wait, the neutrino's rest mass isn't given, so I'll assume it's negligible. So, for the neutrino, m_nu ≈ 0.

So, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of Pi(+):

E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino: E_mu + E_nu.

And since energy is conserved, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Also, the total momentum must be zero, so the magnitudes of their momenta are equal and opposite. Let's denote the momentum of mu(+) as p, then the momentum of neutrino is -p.

The energy of each particle is given by the relativistic energy formula: E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

So for mu(+) (which has mass), E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, the correct formula is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). Units can get a bit tricky, but in particle physics, it's often convenient to use units where c=1, so energy is in MeV, mass in MeV/c², and momentum in MeV/c.

So, in natural units (c=
