Okay, so I've got this problem where a chemist found a white solid and is trying to identify it using some spectral data. Let's see what I can figure out here.

The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, and there's another peak at 158 with 32%. Hmm, that suggests maybe some kind of isotope pattern. Wait, molecular weight is 156. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the IR data: there's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad usually means O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 probably indicates a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 or so, but maybe a bit higher if it's another type of carbonyl like an ester or acid chloride. Wait, but the broad peak suggests -OH. So likely a carboxylic acid because their O-H is broad and strong. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde or ketone, but the broad peak makes me think of O-H.

Now the 1H NMR:
- 11.0 ppm singlet, integrating to 1H. That's really high. Aromatic protons are usually lower, like around 7 ppm. 11 ppm is super high, like an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but 11 is even higher. Oh, but wait, sometimes in certain environments, like if it's an acidic proton, maybe a carboxylic acid. Because the carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But in the NMR, this is a singlet, which would fit a -OH in a carboxylic acid because the exchange might make it a singlet.

Wait, but wait, the other peaks are at 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are in the aromatic region. The doublets suggest two sets of two equivalent protons each, probably para-substituted. So the structure probably has a benzene ring with two substituents that are para to each other. Let me think: if it's a benzoic acid, then the substituents would be the COOH group and another group, like Cl, in the para position?

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So structure would be Cl in para, and COOH in another position. So the benzene ring would have Cl and COOH groups on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl in position 4 relative to the COOH, which is position 1. So Cl is at position 4, which is para to position 1. So then the benzene would have two substituents: COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4?

Wait, no, wait. Benzoic acid is a benzene ring with a COOH group attached. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl would be in the para position relative to the COOH. So the benzene ring would have COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. The H's ortho to COOH would be deshielded and appear downfield. Wait, for benzoic acid, the substituents are COOH and Cl. The aromatic protons would be in the meta and para positions?

Wait, benzoic acid is:

O
||
COOH attached to benzene.

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, Cl is attached at the para position relative to COOH. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl).

So the remaining two protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) and positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOH, but para to Cl). Wait, but if substituents are at 1 and 4, the ring would have H's at 2,3,5,6. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 and 4. So the H at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and H at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH, but para to Cl.

Wait, but in such a case, the H's at positions 2 and 6 would be deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing COOH group, so they would appear downfield. The H's at 3 and 5 would be next to Cl, which is electron-withdrawing, so they might also be deshielded but perhaps less so.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have two doublets: one at 8.02 (d, 2H) and another at 7.72 (d, 2H). Each is integrating to 2H, so perhaps two sets of two equivalent H's each.

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent due to symmetry, and the H's at positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So each set would be a doublet. Let me think, the H at 2 would be next to COOH and Cl (since Cl is at 4). Hmm, no, wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the H's at 2 and 6 are meta to Cl, and ortho to COOH. The H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH.

So the H's at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH, which is a strong EWG, so they would be more downfield. The H's at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to Cl, which is slightly EWG as well, but perhaps less so than COOH. So in the NMR, the H's closer to COOH (at 2 and 6) would be downfield, maybe around 8.02 ppm, as a doublet. The H's at 3 and 5 would be at a slightly lower ppm, say 7.72, also a doublet.

That matches the NMR data.

Now, the IR: strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700, so 1720 might be a bit high. Wait, but benzoic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1680-1720 cm^-1. Wait, maybe it's a bit higher. Alternatively, if it's an acid chloride, the carbonyl is around 1800, but that's not the case here. So 1720 could fit a carboxylic acid.

The broad peak from 3500-2700 is likely the O-H stretching of the carboxylic acid. That's broad because it's hydrogen bonded.

So putting that together, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is option B.

Wait, but let's check the molecular formula. Molecular ion at 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Molecular weight: (12*7)+(1*6)+(16*2) = 84 +6 +32=122. The molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid would be 122 +35.5 (Cl) = 157.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at m/z 156. That would be 156, but 157.5 is around 158. So maybe the molecular ion is at 156, but the molecular formula would be (probably) Cl is 35.5, so the total would be 157.5, which would round to m/z 158 as the molecular ion. But in the data, the molecular ion is at 156, but there's a peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula is such that the molecular ion is 156, and the peak at 158 is the M+2 isotope. Let's think of the possible molecular formula.

Assuming it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So molecular weight around 156.5. Then the M peak would be at m/z 157? Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecular formula is C8H7ClO2. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight is 7*(12) =84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, 2*(16)=32. So 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32= 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at 156.5, which would appear at m/z 156 or 157. But in the problem statement, the molecular ion is at m/z 156, and there's a peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, so perhaps the molecular formula is such that the M is 156, and M+2 is 158.

Wait, Cl has a natural abundance of about 34.9% for Cl-35 and 65% for Cl-37. So the molecular ion would be at M = 156 (for Cl-35) and M+2 =158 (Cl-37). The ratio should be about 65% for M+2 (since Cl-37 is about 65% abundant). The given data is M at 100%, and M+2 at 32%. That doesn't fit because for Cl, it's about 78% M (Cl-35) and 22% M+2 (Cl-37), but the M+2 would be about 32% of M+2. Wait, no: the abundance is about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So the ratio of M to M+2 is roughly 75% : 25%, so 3:1. But in the data, M is 100% (so maybe it's the base peak), and M+2 is 32%. So that suggests that M is 156, and M+2 is 158, which is at 32% of M. But I'm a bit confused because Cl's M+2 is usually about a third of the M peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't contain Cl. But the options have Cl in all except option C, which is phenyl chloroformate. Wait, option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is OCl-CO-O-phenyl?

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2. Same as option B, but different structure. Molecular weight would be same, 156.5.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid, C7H5ClO2, same formula as A.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is ClCO-O-phenyl. Molecular formula: C7H5ClO3. Molecular weight: (7*12) + (5*1) +35.5 + (3*16) = 84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +48=172.5. So molecular ion would be around 172 or 173. But in the problem, it's 156. So option C is probably not correct.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 2 relative to COOH. Molecular formula C7H5ClO2, same as A and B. Molecular weight 156.5.

So the mass spec shows M at 156, and M+2 at 158 (32%). Let's calculate the possible molecular weight of the compound.

If it's C7H5ClO2, molecular weight is 156.5. So the M peak would be at 157 (rounded), but the given M is 156. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C8H8O2Cl, but that would be a higher molecular weight.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the molecular weight. The molecular ion is at 156. So the molecular formula must sum up to a molecular weight of 156.

Let me calculate for each option:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid: C7H5ClO2.

12*7 =84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 16*2=32.

84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So M is around 156.5, so the molecular ion is at 156 (the integer part). The M+2 would be at 158 (because Cl-37 is 24.2% abundant). So the peak at 158 is 32%, which is close but a bit lower than expected (24.2% would be about 24% of the base peak, but in the data it's 32% of the base). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecular weight is 156, and the formula is C8H8O2? Let's calculate that.

C8: 12*8=96, H8:8, O2:32. Total 96+8=104 +32=136. That's way lower than 156. So no.

Another option: C6H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 6*12=72 +5=5 (H5?), wait, wait, 6*12=72, Cl=35.5, O2=32. So 72+5 (H5)=77 +35.5=112.5 +32=144.5. No, that's lower than 156.

Wait, perhaps it's C8HClO3. Let's see: 8*12=96, 1*1=1, Cl=35.5, O3=48. So 96+1=97 +35.5=132.5 +48=180.5. So that's higher than 156.

Hmm, maybe the molecular formula is C9H10O2. 9*12=108, 10=10, 32. 108+10=118 +32=150. Still lower than 156.

Wait, maybe the formula is C7H7ClO2. Let's calculate: 7*12=84, 7=7, 35.5, 32. So 84+7=91 +35.5=126.5 +32=158.5. So M would be 158, but the given M is 156. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a molecular weight of 156, which would mean that either the Cl is not present, but that's not possible because all options except C have Cl.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C7H6ClO2. Let's compute: 7*12=84, 6=6, Cl=35.5, O2=32. 84+6=90 +35.5=125.5 +32=157.5. So the molecular ion would be at 157, but the data says 156.

I'm getting a bit stuck on the mass spec. Let's think about the options again.

The options have either Cl and a carbonyl group, possibly in benzoic acid or chloroformate.

Looking at option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure with COOH and Cl. The NMR has two doublets, which matches the para substitution. The IR has O-H and carbonyl. The molecular weight is 156.5, which would match a molecular ion at 156 and M+2 at 158 (32% of base). Wait, but the M+2 should be approximately 24% of M because Cl-37 is about 24% abundant. But in the data, M+2 is 32% of the base, which is higher than 24%. Maybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion is at 156, and the M+2 is at 158. The ratio is about 32%. So, what's the natural abundance of Cl-37? Approximately 24.2%. So the M+2 should be about 24% of the M peak. But the data says 32%. Hmm, that's a bit of a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula includes another element like Br, but the options don't have Br.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the molecular formula would be C7H5ClO3. Let's calculate the molecular weight:

7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 3*16=48. Total: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +48=172.5. So molecular ion would be at 172, but the data is 156. So option C is probably not correct.

So, going back. So options A, B, and D have the same molecular formula (C7H5ClO2), so same molecular weight of 156.5. So the mass spec would show M at 156 (base peak) and M+2 at 158 (about 24% of M, but in the data it's 32%).

Hmm, perhaps the data is an approximation, and it's close enough. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have Cl, but that can't be because all options except C have Cl.

Another point: looking at the NMR, the 11 ppm singlet is probably the -OH proton in the carboxylic acid. The two doublets in the aromatic region suggest a para-substituted benzene, which fits 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

So despite the slight discrepancy in the mass spec, the IR and NMR data fit option B. So I think the correct answer is B.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. The molecular ion peak is at **m/z = 156** (100%), with a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%). The IR spectrum shows a **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes a **singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H)**, likely corresponding to a carboxylic acid proton, and two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)**, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains a benzaldehyde group with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. However, the NMR data does not match this structure, as the singlet at 11.0 ppm is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, not an aldehyde. Additionally, the IR data does not strongly support an aldehyde. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound consists of a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 4 (para-substitution). The IR spectrum matches this structure, as the broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid, and the strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR data also aligns: the singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the acidic proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene. The molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid is **156.5**, consistent with the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**. The secondary peak at **m/z = 158** corresponds to the M+2 isotope (Cl-37), which is expected at ~24% abundance. While the observed 32% is slightly higher than expected, it is close enough to suggest this is the correct structure.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   Phenyl chloroformate has the structure Cl-CO-O-Ph. Its molecular formula is **C₇H₅ClO₃**, giving a molecular weight of **172.5**, which does not match the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**. This option is inconsistent with the data.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound is similar to 4-chlorobenzoic acid but with the chlorine atom at position 2 (meta to the carboxylic acid group). The NMR data does not support this structure, as the aromatic protons would not produce the observed doublets. The IR and molecular weight are consistent, but the NMR mismatch eliminates this option.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular weight, IR, and NMR, strongly support **4-chlorobenzoic acid** as the correct structure. The slight discrepancy in the M+2 isotope abundance is likely due to experimental variations.

**Answer: B**
