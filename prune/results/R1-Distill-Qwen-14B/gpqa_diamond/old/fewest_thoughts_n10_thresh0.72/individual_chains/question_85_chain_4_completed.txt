Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2, each with their own masses and radii. Both have the same albedo, which probably means I don't have to factor that into the temperature ratio, since it's the same for both.

The planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. But wait, the question is about their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star, as well as its albedo. Since albedo is the same, I can ignore that for the ratio.

The question gives me some data about the Doppler shifts from each planet. Wait, how does that relate to their orbital periods or distances? Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The amount of shift tells us about the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star in orbit around the barycenter.

The RV shifts are given as 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2 in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Wait, but how does that relate to the planets' masses and orbital periods? Oh, because the RV method gives us the velocity of the star, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, but equilibrium temperature is primarily dependent on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. So I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which depends on the ratio of their distances to the star raised to the ½ power, and the square root of the ratio of their albedos (but albedos are same, so that's 1).

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, no, wait. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)

Since albedo is same, the ratio of T_eq for Planet1 to Planet2 is sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt(a2/a1)

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So I need to find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes of the two planets. Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the radius of the orbit.

How can I find a1 and a2? Well, from the radial velocity method, the velocity of the star is given by the formula:

v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but I also know that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v_star) = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

But wait, another way is to use the relation between the Doppler shift and the velocity. The Doppler shift (delta lambda) is given by delta lambda / lambda = v / c.

Wait, but they gave the shifts in terms of Angstroms. The [OI] line is at 6300 Å. So for each planet, the shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

So delta lambda = 0.03 Å for Planet1, 0.04 for Planet2. The velocity v (of the star) can be calculated using the formula:

v = c * (delta lambda) / lambda

Where c is the speed of light. Let's compute that.

But wait, the speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s, but more precisely, about 2.9979e5 km/s. For small shifts, we can approximate c as 3e5 km/s.

So for Planet1: delta lambda = 0.03 Å, lambda = 6300 Å.

v1 = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300) = (3e5) * (0.03/6300) km/s.

Let me compute that. 0.03 is 3e-2. 6300 is 6.3e3.

So 3e5 * (3e-2)/(6.3e3) = 3e5 * (3e-2)/(6.3e3) = 3e5 * (3/(6.3e5)) ) = 3e5 * (3)/(6.3e5) ) = 3e5 * (1/210,000) * 3.

Wait, let's compute 3e5 * 3e-2 = 9e3. Divide by 6.3e3: 9e3 /6.3e3 = 9/6.3 ≈ 1.4286.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3e5 * (0.03 / 6300) = 3e5 * (0.0000047619) = ?

Wait, 0.03 /6300 = 0.03 / (6.3e3) )= 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = (3e-2) / (6.3e3) )= (3)/(6.3e5) )= approx 4.7619e-6.

So 3e5 km/s * 4.7619e-6 = 3e5 * 4.7619e-6 = 1.42857 km/s.

So v1 (velocity semi-amplitude for Planet1) is approximately 1.4286 km/s.

Similarly, for Planet2: delta lambda is 0.04 Å.

v2 = 3e5 * (0.04 /6300) = 3e5 * (4e-2)/(6.3e3) = 3e5 * (4/(6.3e5)) )= 3e5 * (4)/(6.3e5) )= (3e5 *4) / (6.3e5) )= 12e5 / 6.3e5 = 12/6.3 ≈ 1.9048 km/s.

So v1 ≈ 1.4286 km/s, v2 ≈1.9048 km/s.

But wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, perhaps there's a simpler formula when M_planet << M_star, which is the case here, since the star is 1.5 solar masses and the planets are 7 and 5 Earth masses. Earth's mass is about 3e-6 solar masses. So 7 Earth masses is about 2e-5 solar masses. So M_planet << M_star.

So the approximation for K is:

K ≈ ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P * (2 pi) )^(1/3) )) )

But wait, wait, the exact formula when M_planet is much smaller than M_star is:

K ≈ ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( ( M_star )^(2/3) ( P )^(1/3) ) )

Which can be rearranged to find P.

But wait, perhaps a better approach is to express the ratio of the velocities.

Because the star's velocity is proportional to (M_planet / M_star^(2/3)) / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but for two different planets, we can write:

v1 / v2 = ( M1 sin i / M2 sin i ) * ( (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) * ( M_star^(2/3) / M_star^(2/3) ) )

Wait, but M_star is same for both, so it cancels. So:

v1 / v2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )

But without knowing the period, this might not help. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the RV method gives the mass function, but maybe I can relate the velocities to the semi-major axes.

Wait, another approach: the mass function for a planet is given by:

f(M) = (M_planet^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^2 ) ) = ( (4 pi^2) / (G P^2) ) ) * (a * (1 - e^2)^1.5 )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it simplifies.

But perhaps that's getting complicated. Another approach: the star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The velocity of the star is v = (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) * V_planet, where V_planet is the planet's orbital speed. But since M_planet << M_star, this is approximately v ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * V_planet.

But V_planet is sqrt( G (M_star + M_planet) / a ) ≈ sqrt( G M_star / a ), since M_planet is much smaller.

So v ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star / a )

Which simplifies to v ≈ (M_planet / sqrt( a )) ) * sqrt( G / M_star )

So v is proportional to M_planet / sqrt(a).

So for Planet1 and Planet2:

v1 / v2 = (M1 / sqrt(a1)) ) / (M2 / sqrt(a2)) ) = (M1 / M2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

From earlier, v1 is 1.4286 km/s, v2 is 1.9048 km/s.

So (1.4286) / (1.9048) = (M1 / M2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses. So M1/M2 is 7/5 = 1.4.

So 1.4286 / 1.9048 ≈ 0.75.

So 0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Then sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357.

So a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

Wait, but wait, I'm trying to find a1 and a2. Or, since I need the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, which is sqrt(a2/a1) as I found earlier.

Wait, earlier I thought T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Because T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

So T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2a1) ), T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2a2) )

So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So from the previous calculation, sqrt(a2/a1) is approximately 0.5357.

So T_eq1/T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357. So the ratio is approximately 0.5357, which is about 0.53. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the velocity ratio is v1=1.4286, v2=1.9048.

v1/v2 = 1.4286 / 1.9048 ≈ 0.75.

M1/M2 =7/5=1.4.

So 0.75= (1.4) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.75 /1.4 = 0.5357.

So a2/a1= (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

So a1 = a2 / 0.287 ≈ 3.48 a2.

Wait, but T_eq ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.5357, which is about 0.536.

So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 is 0.5357, so T_eq1 is about 0.53 times T_eq2.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So T1/T2 is 0.53, which is option C.

But wait, let me think again: if a planet is farther from the star, its equilibrium temperature is lower, because it receives less flux.

So Planet2 has a higher velocity shift, which implies a larger velocity, which would mean either higher mass or larger a, or a combination.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggests that a2 is smaller than a1, because sqrt(a2/a1) is less than 1. So a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

But if Planet1 is farther, then its equilibrium temperature would be lower than Planet2's. So T_eq1 < T_eq2, so the ratio T1/T2 is less than 1. Which is what I calculated, 0.53.

So that would make option C correct.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}}
\]

where \(T_{\text{star}}\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance. Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) can be inferred from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV method measures the star's velocity semi-amplitude \(v\), which is proportional to \(M_{\text{planet}} / \sqrt{a}\) for a given star. From the problem, the RV shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. Using the Doppler shift formula:

\[
v = c \cdot \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}
\]

where \(c\) is the speed of light (\(3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\)) and \(\lambda = 6300 \, \text{Å}\), we calculate:

\[
v_1 = 3 \times 10^5 \cdot \frac{0.03}{6300} \approx 1.4286 \, \text{km/s}, \quad v_2 = 3 \times 10^5 \cdot \frac{0.04}{6300} \approx 1.9048 \, \text{km/s}.
\]

The ratio of the velocities is:

\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{1.4286}{1.9048} \approx 0.75.
\]

Since \(v \propto M_{\text{planet}} / \sqrt{a}\), we have:

\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}.
\]

Given \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), the mass ratio is:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4.
\]

Substituting into the velocity ratio equation:

\[
0.75 = 1.4 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}.
\]

Solving for \(\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75}{1.4} \approx 0.5357.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx 0.5357.
\]

This corresponds to approximately 0.53, making the correct answer:
