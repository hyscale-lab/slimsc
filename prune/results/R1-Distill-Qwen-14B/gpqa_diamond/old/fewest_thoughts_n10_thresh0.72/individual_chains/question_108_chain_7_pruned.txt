Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that we have a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. The values of m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) are small. The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla. We need to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm, I remember that the paramagnetic coupling term is related to the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect is when an atom's energy levels split in a magnetic field. The paramagnetic term is like the energy due to the magnetic interaction of the electron's orbital motion with the external field.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m determines the orientation of the angular momentum relative to the magnetic field. Since m is small, maybe the effect is not too large, but I'm not exactly sure how that plays into this.

The transition energy ΔE is given through the wavelength. I think the energy of a photon is related to wavelength by E = hc/λ. So I can calculate ΔE using that formula. Let's note down the values: λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.

Calculating ΔE:
ΔE = hc / λ
λ = 486.1e-9 meters
So ΔE ≈ (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9)
Let me compute that step by step.

First, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 486.1e-9 m:
1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = (1.9878 / 486.1) * 1e-16 ≈ (0.004089) * 1e-16 = 4.089e-19 J.

Wait, but wait, another way to compute. Let me check the exponents again. 3e8 is 3*10^8, 6.626e-34 is 6.626*10^-34. Multiply them: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then, λ is 486.1e-9 m, so 4.861e-7 m. Oops, I think I miscalculated earlier. Let me redo:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / 486.1e-9 m
= (1.9878e-25 J·m) / 486.1e-9 m
= (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) J
= (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 J
≈ 0.4088 * 1e-18 J
≈ 4.088e-19 J.

So ΔE is about 4e-19 J.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. The energy H is given by the Zeeman term, which is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is due to the orbital angular momentum L. The formula is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m, but wait, the orbital magnetic moment is given by μ_L = (μ_B) * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. The Bohr magneton is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.

Wait, the magnetic moment μ is μ = g * μ_B * m, where g is the Landé g-factor. For orbital angular momentum, g is approximately 1. So H = -μ·B = -g μ_B m B.

Wait, but wait, the energy H is the expectation value, so ⟨H⟩ = -g μ_B m B. But m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can take values from -l to +l in integer steps. However, the problem states that m is small, but I think in this context, m could be any value, but maybe the magnitude is small, but perhaps we don't need to worry about the exact value because we're comparing the order of magnitude.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that m is small. So maybe m is zero or a small integer, but I'm not sure how that affects the comparison yet. Let me think about the magnitude of ⟨H⟩.

So, the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ = g μ_B m B. Wait, but m is an integer (0, ±1, ±2, etc.), and let's say m is small, but B is 1 T.

So let's compute ⟨H⟩. The Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T. Let's take m as a small integer, say m=1 (since the problem says small m, maybe even m=0, but if m=0, then ⟨H⟩ would be zero
