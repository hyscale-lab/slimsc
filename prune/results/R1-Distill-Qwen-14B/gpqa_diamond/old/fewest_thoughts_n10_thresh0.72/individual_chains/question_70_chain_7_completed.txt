Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see... the question is about a series of reactions, and the end goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, symmetry groups can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I need to parse all the reactions given. Let's list them out.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

I think I should start by figuring out what the substances could be. Let's go reaction by reaction.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Bright red product makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, but 8 equivalents of B... that's a lot. If B is a diatomic gas, like Cl2 or O2, maybe. Let me think about the reactions.

Another approach: Reaction 3 is C + H2O → A + F + G. So C is reacting with water to produce acids. So perhaps C is a salt, and when it dissolves, it forms the parent acid and another acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide? Because when metal oxides react with water, they form metal hydroxides (but that's bases) unless it's a non-metal oxide forming acids.

Wait, F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a nitride or a more complicated compound. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide? Because when sulfides react with water, they can produce H2S (which is a weak acid) and maybe some other acid if it's a more complex sulfide.

Wait, but another thought: Reaction 4 is D + B → H (solvent). Solvents are usually things like water, ethanol, ether, etc. Hmm. If D and B are gases reacting to form a solvent, maybe B is H2O and D is something else? Or perhaps B is another gas.

Wait, let me think about the possible compounds. Let's try to find possible candidates for E because that's the product whose symmetry we need.

E is produced when C reacts with D. So first, what's E? Let's try to figure out what C and D could be.

From reaction 3: C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G is weak. So if C is a salt, maybe a sulfite or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Wait, if C is a nitride, then reacting with water would give NH3 and maybe another acid. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to reaction 1: 8 equivalents of B. Let's think of a reaction where a solid reacts with multiple equivalents of a gas. For example, something like the formation of Na2O2? Or perhaps the reaction of a metal with chlorine gas. Like Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. But 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe something like aluminum reacting with chlorine? Or perhaps something else.

Wait, another angle: the product C is bright red. That's a strong clue. What's bright red in chemistry? Sulfur is bright yellow, so that's not it. Maybe a copper compound? Copper(II) sulfate is blue. Hmm... Maybe a manganese compound or something else. Alternatively, lead dioxide is dark brown. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: If C is a sulfide, maybe when it reacts with D, which is a halogen, it produces H2S or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate? Wait, but nitrates don't typically form bright red products.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a compound like Na2O2. Wait, sodium peroxide is a bright white solid, but perhaps in a different context... Not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). D and B are gases, reacting in 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Common gas reactions to form solvents... Maybe B is O2 and D is H2? Because O2 and H2 can form H2O, but H2O is a solvent. But wait, if H is water, then D would be H2 and B would be O2. But in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2). So then, A + 8 O2 → C. What solid reacts with O2 in such a way? Maybe a metal reacting to form an oxide.

Wait, what metal reacts with O2 in a 8:1 ratio? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2. Because A reacts with 8 Cl2. Let's think: perhaps A is sodium (Na), but 8 Cl2 would give NaCl2? Wait, sodium typically forms NaCl, not NaCl2. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, think of another reaction. Maybe A is S (sulfur), reacting with 8 equivalents of O2? That would produce SO4^2- or something? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: reaction 3. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So C must be a salt. Let's think of a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is sodium nitrate (NaNO3). When it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into Na+ and NO3^-; but that doesn't produce any acid. So that's not it.

Another thought: perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water? No, it would just dissociate. Hmm.

Wait, what about if C is something like (NH4)2Cr2O7, the chromate? When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, like NH4NO3. Wait, that's ammonium nitrate. When it reacts with water, it would dissolve, but I don't think it produces acids. Or maybe decomposes upon heating, but in the presence of water.

Wait, another angle: If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a metal carbonate that reacts with water to produce a weak acid (like HCO3^- which is weakly acidic) and a strong acid (like H+ from H2CO3, but that's not right), or maybe a metal bicarbonate? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like phosgene (but that's COCl2, which is a gas, but perhaps not), or sarin gas, but that's more of a nerve agent. Or maybe chlorine gas? No, because D is a gas, and perhaps E is another gas.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic compound like hydrogen cyanide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to reaction 4: D and B form H, which is a solvent. Possible solvents could be H2O, ethanol, methanol, perhaps. If D and B are gases reacting to form H2O, then D and B would be H2 and O2, but that would require a catalyst. Or maybe D is CO2 and B is H2O? No, because B is a gas, and D is another gas. Another option: D is NH3 and B is something else. But NH3 is a gas, and when it reacts with a gas, perhaps HCl? Wait, but then H would be NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe D is CO2 and B is NaOH (but that's a solid, not a gas). No, B is a gas. Hmm. Alternatively, D and B could be SO3 and H2O, forming H2SO4, which is a liquid (but more of a viscous liquid, so maybe a solvent). But SO3 is a gas, H2O is a liquid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, think about D and B forming an alcohol. Like D is CO2 and B is something else. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: What if H is methanol (CH3OH)? Then D and B would be CO and H2, reacting via some catalyst. Like CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. That's a possibility. So D is H2 and B is CO. So in reaction 4, H2 + CO → CH3OH (methanol, which is a solvent). That fits because methanol is a solvent.

So if B is CO (carbon monoxide) and D is H2, then reaction 4 is CO + H2 → CH3OH. So that would make H as methanol.

Wait, but B is a gas in reaction 1 as well. So in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 equivalents of CO. Hmm, what solid reacts with CO in such a way? Maybe a metal, like iron reacting with CO to form an iron carbonyl? But that might not produce a bright red product.

Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe D is Cl2 and B is C. Then H would be CCl4, which is a solvent (carbon tetrafluoride is CCl2F2, but that's another story). Wait, but C reacting with Cl2 in 1:1 ratio? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then H would be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps D is NH3 and B is HCl. But then H would be NH4Cl, which is a solid. Hmm, not a solvent.

Wait, maybe B is SO3 and D is H2O, but then SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (which is a liquid, a strong acid). But I don't think that's a common reaction. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4, but that would form CO or CO2 and H2O, depending on conditions.

This is a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let's look at reaction 3 again: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a nitride salt. For example, NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate) when reacted with water gives NH4OH (weak acid) and HNO3 (strong acid). Wait, but when ammonium nitrate dissolves in water, it actually absorbs heat and can decompose. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, if C is ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), then reaction 3 would be: NH4NO3 + H2O → NH4OH + HNO3. But NH4OH is a weak acid (since it's a weak base as ammonium hydroxide, but in water it can act as an acid, but I'm not certain). Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces NH3 and HNO3? No, because it's with water.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate or sulfite. Let's see: if C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water would give 2 NaOH (a strong base) and H2SO3 (which is weakly acidic). Wait, but F and G are acids. Hmm, so that might not fit because NaOH is a base, not an acid.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal bicarbonate, like NaHCO3. Reacting with water would just dissociate, but maybe heating? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a complex salt that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis. For example, something like (NH4)2Cr2O7. When it reacts with water, it might decompose into Cr(OH)3, NH4OH, and possibly other products. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide like FeS. Then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 and H2S. H2S is a weak acid, and Fe(OH)2 is a base. Hmm, but F is a strong acid, G is weak. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate), then reaction with water would produce NH4OH (a weak acid) and HNO3 (a strong acid). So F could be HNO3, G is NH4OH. But wait, NH4OH is a weak base, but in water, it can donate a proton to become NH3 and H3O+. So maybe in this case, it's acting as a weak acid. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonamide or something else, but this is getting too speculative.

Let me think about reaction 2: C reacts with D in 2 equivalents to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. If C is NH4NO3 and D is something like H2, then reaction could produce something like N2 and H2O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is PbO2 (lead dioxide), which is a bright brown solid. Wait, but the product is bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The bright red product C. What about a compound like CuO? No, that's black. Wait, maybe it's a different copper compound. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a vanadium compound, but vanadium(III) oxide is green. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, maybe it's a nitrobenzene derivative. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe a different oxidation state. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction where a solid reacts with a large amount of a diatomic gas. For example, sulfur reacting with oxygen to form SO3. But sulfur is bright yellow, not red. Alternatively, perhaps it's phosphorus reacting with something. Hmm, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps reaction 1 is the reaction of a metal with chlorine gas. For example, if A is iron and B is Cl2. Then, Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But FeCl3 is yellow, not red. Alternatively, if A is sodium, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would form NaCl, but that's colorless. Hmm, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum and B is Cl2. 8 equivalents of Cl2 would form AlCl3. AlCl3 is white, but maybe in some form, it's colored? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible structure of E and its symmetry.

E is the product of C and D. If E has a certain symmetry group, what could it be? The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v.

Wait, D∞h is the symmetry group of a molecule with an infinite number of symmetry planes, like a straight chain of identical units. For example, HCN has D∞h symmetry because the linear chain can be mirrored along any plane perpendicular to the axis. Alternatively, O2 has D∞h symmetry. Wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, D4h is a point group with a four-fold axis plus horizontal mirror planes. Examples include molecules like SO4^2- (but that's a tetrahedral ion). Wait, SO4^2- has Td symmetry, not D4h. Hmm. D4h is also the symmetry of some transition metal complexes, like octahedral complexes with certain ligands.

C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. Molecules like H2O have C2 symmetry because they can be rotated 180 degrees and look the same.

C2v has a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. For example, molecules like H2O have C2v symmetry because they have a C2 axis (along the O atom) and two mirror planes (each containing the O and a hydrogen).

Wait, but wait: H2O has C2v symmetry. Because when you rotate 180 degrees, the H's swap places but the molecule looks the same. Also, there are mirror planes through each H and the O.

So if E is H2O, then its symmetry group would be C2v. But whether that's the case depends on what E is.

Alternatively, if E is O2 (oxygen gas), which is diatomic, its symmetry group is D∞h. Because a diatomic molecule like O2 has a main C2 axis, and an infinite number of mirror planes perpendicular to it, leading to D∞h symmetry.

But wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, the symmetry group would be D∞h.

But how would E be O2? Let's see.

Looking back, E is produced when C reacts with D. So if C is a compound that upon reaction with D releases O2, or perhaps D is O2 and C is something that reacts with O2 to produce another compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, reaction 2 is C + 2D → E. If E is O2, then D should be a compound that when reacted with C produces O2. But that's not making sense because O2 is a gas, and D is also a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2? Cl2 has D∞h symmetry as well since it's a diatomic molecule. But I don't know if that's relevant.

Wait, what if E is a different diatomic molecule? Let's think. If E is CO, which is a diatomic, then its symmetry group is D∞h. Or perhaps E is O3, which is a triatomic molecule with C2v symmetry.

Wait, let me think about reaction 2 again. If C is a sulfide and D is oxygen, then C + O2 → SO2 or something. But SO2 is a bent molecule with D2h symmetry, I think. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule with a higher symmetry. Let's see, what are the options given.

Options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's probably a diatomic molecule like O2, Cl2, etc. If it's a linear molecule, then it's D∞h.

Another possibility is that E is a linear molecule with multiple atoms but identical ends, like HCN, which has D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, what if E is a benzene molecule? No, benzene is planar with D6h symmetry.

Wait, but E is the product of C and D. Let's see what C and D could be.

If C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Let me think of a reaction that produces a diatomic gas. For example, if C is a metal oxide and D is a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, perhaps C is something like H2S and D is Cl2. Then, H2S + Cl2 → 2HCl + S. But that's a possible reaction. HCl is a strong acid, and S is a solid. But E in this case would be HCl, which is a gas. Wait, but HCl has a symmetry group of C2v, I think.

Wait, but in the problem, when C reacts with D, it's 2 equivalents of D. Let's say C is H2S, D is Cl2. The reaction is H2S + Cl2 → 2HCl + S. So E would be HCl gas. But HCl is a linear molecule, so its symmetry group is D∞h.

Wait, but then E would be HCl, which is a molecule with D∞h symmetry. Hmm.

But let's think about the other reactions. Reaction 4: D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If D is Cl2 and B is something else, maybe H is HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. So that's not possible.

Wait, earlier I thought maybe D is H2 and B is CO, making H as methanol (CH3OH). So D is H2, B is CO. So in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 equivalents of CO. What could A be?

If A is Fe (iron), then Fe + CO could form Fe(CO)5, which is a liquid. But Fe(CO)5 is a known compound, a liquid at room temperature, but I'm not sure about the reaction. Fe(CO)5 is bright yellow, not red, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is Na (sodium), reacting with CO to form sodium carbonyl (Na2CO). But I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that reacts with CO to form a different compound. For example, Ni(CO)4 is a liquid, but again, that's not a bright red product.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me try to think of another angle. Let's go back to reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis produces two acids. For example, a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to form NaOH (strong base, which would act as a weak acid in solution) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). Wait, but F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So maybe C is something like Mg(NO3)SO4. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a carbonate. For example, a mixed salt. But that seems complicated.

Wait, another thought: what if C is ammonium dichromate, (NH4)2Cr2O7. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into Cr(OH)3, NH4OH, and possibly H2O. But I'm not certain about the products.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is RSO3Na, then reaction with water would produce RSO3H (a strong acid if R is a good leaving group) and NaOH (a base, which can act as a weak acid). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrite salt. For example, NaNO2. When it reacts with water, it might produce HNO2 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base, which can act as a weak acid). But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the reaction produces two different acids because C is a metal carbonate. For example, if C is CaCO3, then CaCO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + CO2. But CO2 is a gas, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to figure out what E could be, given the options for symmetry groups.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a diatomic molecule. So what extremely hazardous diatomic gas could be formed?

Hmm. Let me think about possible dangerous diatomic gases. Cl2 is dangerous, O3 (ozone) is dangerous, but O2 isn't. SO2 is a gas, but it's triatomic. HCN is a gas, but it's linear and has D∞h symmetry. Wait, but HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. But is HCN extremely hazardous? Yes, it's highly toxic.

Wait, but in the reaction, C reacts with D to produce E. If E is HCN, then what's C and D?

Wait, HCN can be produced from reactions like the reaction of cyanide salts with strong acids. But in this case, D is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is phosgene (COCl2), but that's a triatomic molecule. Its symmetry group is C2v. Wait, because the structure is O=C(Cl)Cl, which is a trigonal planar molecule with a C2 axis and two mirror planes. So its symmetry group would be D3h, I think.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the symmetry groups of all these molecules. For example, HCN is a linear molecule, so it's D∞h symmetry. O2 is D∞h as well. Cl2 is D∞h.

So, if E is a diatomic molecule, its symmetry group is D∞h (option C).

But how does that tie into the rest of the reactions?

Let me try to piece this together.

Assume E is O2. Then, reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O2.

But O2 is produced from C and D. So what reaction produces O2 from a solid C and a gas D?

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, but that would require C and D to react to form Cl2. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which is a triatomic molecule with C2v symmetry (option D).

Wait, but O3 has a bent structure, which falls under the C2v symmetry group.

Alternatively, maybe E is a different molecule. Wait, another extremely hazardous gas is H2S, but it's a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. But H2S is not that dangerous compared to others.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is SO2, which is a bent triatomic molecule. Its symmetry group is D3h. But D3h isn't one of the options, so that can't be.

Hmm. Alternatively, if E is CH4, but that's not extremely hazardous. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps E is a different type of molecule. Let me think: What about H2O? It has C2v symmetry. But is H2O extremely hazardous? No, it's a common molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a more complex molecule, but that would complicate things.

Wait, perhaps E is a benzene derivative, but that's not a gas.

Wait, I'm going to try to make some assumptions here.

Let me assume that E is O2, which has D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.

Then, reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O2.

But what reaction produces O2? Decomposition reactions, or reactions where a compound releases O2.

If C is a metal oxide and D is another oxide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if C is a peroxide, like H2O2. When H2O2 decomposes, it produces O2. But in that case, D would be H2O2, but D is a gas. H2O2 is a liquid, so that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about what else could E be.

If E is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry, then reaction 2 must be C + 2 D → HCN.

But what would C and D be? Maybe C is a cyanide salt, and D is something like H2O or another acid.

Wait, but D is a gas. So if D is H2O, then perhaps C is NaCN. But NaCN + H2O would produce HCN and NaOH. So reaction would be NaCN + H2O → HCN + NaOH. But that's a 1:1 reaction, but reaction 2 uses 2 equivalents of D. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and C is a nitrile. But I'm not sure.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to proceed based on the information that E's symmetry is D∞h, which implies it's a diatomic molecule. So, the most likely candidates are O2, Cl2, HCN, etc.

In the problem, E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. If E is O2, then perhaps C is a compound that, when heated with D, releases O2. For example, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, and D is a strong acid. But then D would be a liquid, not a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate, and D is something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, and D is something like H2O, but as I thought earlier, H2O is a liquid.

Wait, another angle: reaction 4 says D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is methanol (CH3OH), then D is H2 and B is CO, which are both gases. So D is H2, B is CO.

Then, reaction 1 is A + 8 CO → C (bright red). What reacts with 8 CO to form a bright red solid?

Wait, perhaps A is iron. Fe reacts with CO to form Fe(CO)5. Iron pentacarbonyl is a liquid, not a solid, and it's yellow, not red. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is chromium. Cr(CO)6 is a volatile liquid, not a solid.

Hmm. Perhaps A is a metal that forms a bright red solid when reacting with CO. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is copper, and B is CO. Cu reacts with CO to form CuO and CO. But CuO is black, not red. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe A is lead. Pb reacts with CO to form PbO and CO. But PbO is yellow, I think.

Wait, perhaps A is a different substance. Let's think: 8 equivalents of CO. If A is sodium, 8 CO would give Na2(CO)4? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think in terms of the reaction products.

In reaction 3, C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

If F is HNO3 (strong acid) and G is H2SO3 (weak acid), then C could be (NH4)2SO3NO3, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, if C is NaNO3·H2SO4, but that's not a typical compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a carbonate. For example, NaNO3 and Na2CO3. But that's not a single compound.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal hydroxide. But that would produce a base, not acids.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that E has D∞h symmetry, making the answer option C.

So, the answer would be C) D∞h.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form a bright red product C. The bright red color suggests a specific compound, but the exact identity of A, B, and C is unclear. However, the reaction involves a solid and a gas, producing a colored product.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. This reaction suggests that E is likely a diatomic or linear molecule, as such reactions often produce simple gases or small molecules.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates that C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to form acids, such as a nitride or sulfide.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests that D and B are gases that react to form a liquid or low-boiling solvent, such as methanol (CH₃OH).

From the options provided, the symmetry group of E is determined by its molecular structure. If E is a diatomic molecule, it would have **D∞h symmetry**, which is characteristic of linear molecules like O₂, Cl₂, or HCN. Among these, O₂ is a plausible candidate for E, as it is a diatomic gas with **D∞h symmetry** and is extremely hazardous in certain contexts.

Given the evidence and the symmetry groups provided in the options, the most likely symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
