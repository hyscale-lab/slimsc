Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, but they have some differences, right? Like, maybe they have a varying magnetic field? Wait, in a regular cyclotron, the magnetic field is constant, but in a synchrocyclotron, I think the magnetic field increases over time. Oh right, because the particles get heavier in mass when they're accelerated, so to keep the cyclotron frequency the same, the magnetic field needs to change.

The problem states a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy. So T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Does that mean it goes through two acceleration phases, or maybe two cycles? I'm not entirely sure, but maybe it's about the number of times the voltage changes direction, which would relate to the number of revolutions.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. I'm trying to connect this to the number of revolutions the proton makes. 

Wait, in a cyclotron, the time for one revolution depends on the magnetic field. But since this is a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field changes, so the frequency of revolution might change too. Oh, but
