Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I need to figure out which one matches the given spectra.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The problem states that there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. I remember that the broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Wait, but waitâ€”carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because the -OH group is more acidic and can hydrogen bond extensively. Alcohols also have a broad peak, but sometimes it can be a bit less broad. In this case, if the peak is very broad, it's more likely a carboxylic acid, because those O-H stretches are indeed very broad. So that suggests the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is another clue. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. In a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits. If it were an ester, maybe a bit higher, but this is probably a carboxylic acid.

Now onto the 1H NMR. The problem says there are several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, which makes sense because all the options don't seem to have any vinyl groups. The structures are all branched with substituents but no alkenes, I think.

In the NMR, there are two specific signals mentioned: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let's dissect that.

So, splitting in NMR arises from neighboring protons. Each neighboring set of protons can split the signal into a certain number of peaks. The notation tells us how each split occurs. For example, a doublet is split by one neighboring group, a triplet by two, etc. When you have multiple splits, you apply them in order. So a doublet of triplets would first be split into a doublet, and each of those peaks is then split into triplets. Similarly, a doublet of triplets of quartets is even more splitting.

Looking at the structures, each option has a certain arrangement of substituents around the central carbons. Let me try to visualize each structure.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly. The structure would be more like:
CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the central two carbons each have two substituents (one CH3 and one C2H5?), but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Looking at the formula:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH

So, the molecule has two central carbons, each attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 (ethyl group), and also each connected to each other. Then there's a CH2 group connected to COOH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like this: The main chain is -CH2-COOH, but before that, there are two central carbons each bearing two substituents. Each of these central carbons has a methyl (CH3) and an ethyl (C2H5) group attached. So, the molecule is symmetric? Because each of the two central carbons has the same substituents.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

So, this structure would be CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the central two carbons each have a CH2CH3 (ethyl) group and a C2H5 (another ethyl?), or perhaps a CH2CH3 and something else. Wait, maybe each central carbon has an ethyl group and a hydrogen. So, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. I'm getting a bit confused, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

So, each central carbon has a CH3 (m
