Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's equal to c multiplied by S. Oh, wait, c is h/(4π), and S is given with its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S is a 2x2 matrix. 

Wait, I remember that spin matrices for particles like electrons or muons, which are spin-½ particles, have their spin operators represented by Sx, Sy, Sz. These are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So I think S is probably related to the Pauli matrices. Let me think: the standard form for Sy, the y-component of spin, is (ħ/2) times the Pauli y matrix. Because the spin matrices for a spin-½ particle are (ħ/2) σ.

Wait, in this problem, S is given, and the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, let me compare that to the standard Pauli matrices. The Pauli y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right. So S is exactly the Pauli y matrix. So S = σy.

But the operator Ay is given as c times S. So c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but the spin matrices are usually (ħ/2) σ. Let me confirm, because ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) would be ħ/2. So c is h/(4π) = ħ/(2π) * (1/(2π)) ? Wait, no: ħ is h/(2π), so h is 2π ħ. So h/(4π) would be (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. Oh right! So c is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) σy. So that makes sense. Therefore, Ay is the spin operator for the y-component of a spin-½ particle, scaled by the correct constants.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues
