Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a gene mutation in barley that causes an anti-nutritional compound. We need to find which mutation would eliminate this compound. 

The intact gene and four mutations are given. The gene has five exons and four introns. The anti-nutritional compound is probably due to the gene being active, so we need a mutation that disrupts the gene function.

Looking at the sequences, I should compare each mutant to the intact gene. The goal is to find a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or disrupts the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein (i.e., knocking out the gene).

The gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The first exon is at the beginning, so mutations in the first exon could affect the start or early parts of the protein.

Let me look at each mutant:

Intact:
5’-ATG TTT CTG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTT CT A GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’
Wait, comparing to the intact. Let me line them up.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for where the sequences differ.

Mutant 1:
The fourth and fifth nucleotides are 'TT' in intact, but in mutant1 it's 'TA' (since the first part is ATGTTTCT... becomes ATGTTCTAC... Hmm, maybe I should look for differences in codons.

Wait, maybe I should write down the wild type and see where each mutant changes.

Intact:
Positions (relative): 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTG
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
... and so on.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the sequences differ in each mutant.

Mutant 1:
Looking at the beginning, the intact has "TTTCTCGCTGG..." and in mutant1, it's "CTACGCTGG..." So positions might have changed.

Wait, let me write the wild-type and mutant1:

Wild-type starts: ATG TTT CTG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant1 starts: ATG TTT CT A GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, so in mutant1, the third codon is CTG (Leu) in wild type, and in mutant1 it's CTA (Leu as well, since it's the third position change; CTG is Leu, CTA is also Leu). So that's a silent mutation.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me count letters.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTG GCT GGT
