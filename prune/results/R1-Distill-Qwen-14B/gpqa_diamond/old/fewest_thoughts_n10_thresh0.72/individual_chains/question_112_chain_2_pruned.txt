Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the standard basis for spin-1/2 systems. So |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1) in the z-basis.

The question is asking me to calculate two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of an operator with a specific matrix representation, and the average value of that operator.

The operator's matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, okay. So let's think about what that matrix looks like. For a two-level system (since we're dealing with up and down), the matrix would be 2x2.

So A would have zeros on the diagonal because when i=j, the elements are zero. And the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix A is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0   ]

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the matrix representation given is A_ij. So for a 2x2 matrix, A_11 = 0, A_12 = ħ/2, A_21 = ħ/2, A_22 = 0. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the operator A is represented by this matrix. I remember that the eigenstates of such an operator are probably the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices, but let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a different operator.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. Our operator A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], which is like (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because X has 1s in the off-diagonal.

Wait, let me check:

Pauli X:
[[0, 1],
 [1, 0]]

So if I multiply by ħ/2, I get a matrix [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], which matches A. So operator A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the question says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, I can think of this operator A as a spin component
