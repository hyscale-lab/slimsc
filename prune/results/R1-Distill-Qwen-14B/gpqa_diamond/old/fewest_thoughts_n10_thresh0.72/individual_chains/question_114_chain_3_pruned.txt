Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem has two parts, each involving a reaction. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Hmm... Let's tackle the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), it typically undergoes a substitution reaction. Wait, but under what conditions? I think the formation of a cyanohydrin comes to mind. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide in a basic or acidic solution.

Wait, the reaction here is butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN isn't right. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN but wait, butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but that's propionitrile. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and reagent A gives a cyanohydrin. The structure of a cyanohydrin
