Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance.

The question says we've got two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Wait, both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. Oh, and their orbits are circular. 

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is more massive—twice as much as Planet_2's. Hmm, but same radius? So, the stars have same size but different masses. That might affect the probability somehow.

I think the probability of a transit is given by the formula: P = (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and R_s is the star's radius. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the geometric probability of a transit is P = (R_p + R_s) / a, where a is the orbital semi-major axis. Or is it more accurately P = (R_s / a) * (something else?), like the ratio of the star's radius to the distance, plus the planet's radius? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is roughly P ≈ (R_star / a) * (something), but I'm not exactly sure. Oh wait, I think the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (some function). Wait, maybe it's more precise to say that the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)²? No, perhaps that's not right.

Wait, let me think. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is higher if the star is smaller relative to the planet's orbit. The probability is given by P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not certain. Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_s + R_p) / a, but that's the
