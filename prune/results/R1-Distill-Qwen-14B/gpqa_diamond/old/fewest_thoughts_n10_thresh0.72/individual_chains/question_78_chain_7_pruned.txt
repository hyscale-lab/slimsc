Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I remember that potentials are related to charges and currents. The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point and time when a point charge is moving.

Wait, the setup: there's a charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh right, because electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, so the fields we observe at time t are due to the charge's position and state at an earlier time tr, which is when tr = t - (distance)/c. 

So the velocity at time tr is v. I need to find expressions for V and A at time t.

From what I recall, the scalar potential V due to a charge is something like q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But wait, in this case, the charge is moving, so I might need to consider the retarded time. Oh, but wait, the problem gives that t > tr, so the potentials are calculated based on the charge's position at tr.

So for the scalar potential, I think it's just V = q/(4πε₀ |r - d|), but wait, r is the observation point, and d is the vector from where the charge was at tr (let's say that point is s(tr), so the vector from there to r is d). So the distance between the charge at tr and r is |d|. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A and B have V as q/(4πε₀ r), but that r is probably the position vector from the origin. Hmm, but in the problem statement, r is the field point, which is with respect to the origin. So if the charge is at s(tr), then the vector from the charge to r is d, but the distance from the origin to the charge is s(tr). So I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The scalar potential at a point due to a charge is given by V = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q
