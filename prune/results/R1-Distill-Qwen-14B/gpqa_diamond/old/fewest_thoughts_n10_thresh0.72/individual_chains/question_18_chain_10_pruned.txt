Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, I'm not sure if their masses matter for this particular calculation. The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the masses are just extra info to throw me off. I'll keep that in mind but focus on the given abundances.

The given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, these are logarithmic abundance ratios. The subscript indicates which star each measurement is for.

The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. So I can find the solar abundances of Fe and Mg relative to H.

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I think I need to find [Si]_1 / [Si]_2, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe the ratio of silicon in each star compared to the Sun? Hmm, no, the options are all numbers, so probably the ratio between the two stars.

Let me think about how to approach this. I think I'll need to use the given abundance ratios to find the abundance of Si in each star relative to H, then compute the ratio.

Let's start with Star_1. [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 â†’ Fe abundance is solar. The [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. Since [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun, where the subscript sun is the solar value.

Wait, more accurately, the notation [X/Y] is log (nX/nY) - log (nX/n
