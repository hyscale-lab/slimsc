Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0. 

Alright, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, actually, the state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. So the state vector is |Ïˆ> = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually supposed to be normalized, right? So I should check if this vector is normalized. 

Let me compute the norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So I think I need to normalize the state vector because probabilities depend on normalized states. Or wait, maybe the observable is given, and I need to compute the expectation value or something else. Wait, no, the problem is about the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. 

Wait, what's the observable P? It's a matrix with specific elements. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2),
