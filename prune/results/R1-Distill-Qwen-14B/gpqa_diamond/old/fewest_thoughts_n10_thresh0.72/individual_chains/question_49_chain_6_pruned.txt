Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because pericyclic reactions are a bit tricky for me. But let's take it step by step.

The question has three reactions, all involving sigmatropic rearrangements, I think. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for the three reactions. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, let me look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A

Hmm, sigmatropic rearrangement. I remember that Claisen and Cope are examples. Wait, but this reaction involves an amine and an alcohol. Maybe it's a kind of condensation reaction?

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like N,N-dimethoxyethanamine, right? Structure would be CH2(OCH3)2NH. And but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CHOH. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH. Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2. Wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=C(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but has four carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4? But that's not possible in a four-carbon chain. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Or perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2-OH? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on C2 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2CH(O
