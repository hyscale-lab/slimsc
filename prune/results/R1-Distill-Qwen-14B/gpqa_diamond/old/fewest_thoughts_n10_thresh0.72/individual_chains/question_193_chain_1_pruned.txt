Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the relationship is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax decreases as distance increases, right? Because parallax is the angle subtended by the star at two points on Earth's orbit around the sun. So the formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. So, plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, the number of stars as a function of parallax is given, and I need to find it as a function of distance.

So, let me think. Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that into the equation. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx = 1/d gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that.

So 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but wait a second. The question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, per unit range of distance. Hmm, so it's the number of stars per unit distance. Or perhaps the density? Because the way the question is phrased, it's about the number per unit range. So perhaps I need to think about the derivative? Like, the rate of change of N with respect to distance.

Wait, let's clarify. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So, if I have more stars when d is larger, but I need to find how the number changes per unit distance. Hmm, perhaps it's about the differential, like dN/dr
