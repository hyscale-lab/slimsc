Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of compound E. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives a reaction scheme involving several compounds, A through E, and each is formed through a series of reactions. There are also some hints provided, so I'll need to use those to deduce the structures.

Let me start by looking at the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, the hints give more information:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I remember that phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which convert aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if A reacts with a ylide to form that cyclopentane structure, A must have a carbonyl group (since that's what the Wittig reacts with). So A is likely a cyclopentanone or similar ketone.

b) IR spectra: A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower than A's. I think this might indicate a change in the carbonyl group's environment. For example, if A is a ketone and E is another carbonyl compound, maybe an ester or something else. But wait, upon elimination, what happens? Let me think.

Now, let's outline each reaction step:

1. A + HCN â†’ B. Adding HCN usually adds a cyanide group. If A is a ketone, HCN addition would form a cyanohydrin. So, B would be a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached. Or wait, another possibility is that if A is an aldehyde, but the Wittig reaction suggests a ketone, so probably A is a ketone. So when ketone A reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol with a CN group. So B would have a structure where the carbonyl is converted into a CH(OH)CN group.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. When HCN adds to a ketone, it forms a cyanohydrin. The mechanism is the nucleophilic addition of CN- to the carbonyl carbon, then proton transfer, making an alcohol and a ketone adjacent. So the product would have an alcohol group and a nitrile group next to each other.

So, if A is, say, cyclopentanone, then B would be a cyanohydrin, like cyclopentyl cyanohydrin, which would have an OH and CN group on adjacent carbons.

2. B is then reduced with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation of what? Well, the cyanohydrin has both an OH and a CN group. Wait, but the OH is an alcohol and CN is a nitrile. Wait, when you hydrogenate a cyanohydrin, what happens? Let me think. The nitrile group (CN) can be reduced. Oh, but wait, in the presence of H2 and Pd, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine? No, wait, I thought hydrogenation of nitriles typically requires more vigorous conditions, like catalysts like Raney Ni or others. Alternatively, maybe the ketone in the cyanohydrin is reduced. Wait, but the cyanohydrin is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile. Oh wait, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, in the cyanohydrin, the carbonyl is converted to an
