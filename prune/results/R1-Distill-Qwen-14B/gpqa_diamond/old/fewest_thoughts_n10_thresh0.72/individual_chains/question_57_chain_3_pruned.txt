Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that when particles scatter elastically, their kinetic energy is the same before and after the collision. The question gives me some phase shifts, and I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Let's see what I can do.

I think phase shifts are related to partial waves in scattering theory. Each partial wave has an associated phase shift, delta_l, for orbital angular momentum l. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of these phase shifts. The formula I vaguely remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} ( (2l + 1) exp(i delta_l) sin((l + 1)θ) ) or maybe similar terms.

Wait, the problem mentions the measured phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. So each of these must correspond to different l values. Like, δ₀ is probably for l=0, δ₁ for l=1, and so on up to l=4.

The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. That means θ is zero, right? Because the incident beam direction is when the angle is zero degrees. So I need to plug θ=0 into the expression for f(θ) and find its imaginary part.

Wait, let me think about the formula again. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over l of terms involving (2l+1) multiplied by some exponential and sine terms. The general formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [exp(i δ_l) - 1] P_l(cosθ),

where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. Oh, but when θ is zero, cosθ is 1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, etc. Right, so each term becomes (2l+1)[exp(i δ_l) - 1].

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary
