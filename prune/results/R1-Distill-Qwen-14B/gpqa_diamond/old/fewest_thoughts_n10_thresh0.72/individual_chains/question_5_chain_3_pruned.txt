Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, the problem is about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is expressed in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z.

Wait, each component is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with elements [0 1; 1 0]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [0 -i; i 0], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [1 0; 0 -1].

I remember that the operator P is a vector operator, so it's related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, which are 2x2 matrices. The operator P can be written as P = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), where n is a unit vector.

In this case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so n_y must be zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. The eigenvalue equation is P|ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So, (P)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

But P is expressed as (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), since n_y is zero. So the equation simplifies to (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Hmm, because (ħ/2) times that matrix equals the eigenvalue (ħ/2), so the matrix part must be the identity matrix. Wait, no. Let me think again. The eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>
Which is:
(ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>
Divide both sides by (ħ/2):
(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) has to have |ψ> as an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, the matrix (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it explicitly. The Pauli matrices are:
σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]
So, n_x σ_x = n_x [[0,1],[1,0]]
n_z σ_z = n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]
Adding them together gives:
[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is:
[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue 1.

The eigenvalue equation is:
(n_z σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>
Wait, no, I think I messed up. The matrix is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). So, the matrix M is:
M = n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z = 
[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

So, for M |ψ> = |ψ>, which is Mψ = ψ.

Which means that (M - I)ψ = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So, M - I is:
[[n
