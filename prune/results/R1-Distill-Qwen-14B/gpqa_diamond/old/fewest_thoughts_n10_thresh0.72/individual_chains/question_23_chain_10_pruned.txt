Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning the reaction is proceeding, and two new spots appeared, so probably two products formed. The options given are A to D, each suggesting different structures.

Hmm. So first, I need to figure out what the starting material looks like. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw the structure. The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl. The numbering is from the substituent on the benzene. So the group is attached at position 1. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but has four carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4. If the double bond is between 3 and 4, that would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 3 and 4, which is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense because the but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond at position 3. Wait, perhaps I should write it as CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that would be but-1-en-4-yl, maybe? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is: the group is CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No,
