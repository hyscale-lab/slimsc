Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complicated. Let's see if I can break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. The result is only a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes, and there are some weight changes and gas remaining. The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, so let me start by summarizing the setup. The mixture of salts A and B is heated, and it produces gases. These gases go through three tubes. Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution, and tube 3 has red-hot copper.

The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2's weight didn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). 

I think I should first figure out what each of these tubes does. Let's think about each one:

1. Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is an anhydrous (dry) material. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water vapor. So any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed here, causing the tube to gain mass. So the 3.60g increase is likely due to water (H2O) being absorbed. 

2. Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. This is probably to absorb CO2 gas, as CO2 reacts with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 precipitate and water. If the solution's weight didn't change, that suggests no CO2 was present. Because if CO2 were absorbed, the tube's mass would increase. So maybe the gases didn't have CO2?

3. Tube 3: Red-hot copper. This setup is probably to react with sulfur dioxide (SO2). Copper is a metal, and when hot, it can react with SO2. The reaction would be 2 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + 2 S. Or wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, SO2 could be oxidized to SO3 or something else. Wait, but the product would be CuO and some other substance. Since the weight increased by 0.80g, that suggests some solid was formed. Let me think: the reaction is 4 Cu + SO2 → 2 Cu2O + SO2? No, wait, maybe it's 2 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + S↓? Or perhaps another stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps it's the oxidation of SO2 to SO3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, when SO2 passes through red-hot copper, maybe it's a catalyst for some reaction. Or perhaps the copper is used to remove hydrogen sulfide? Hmm, not sure. Wait, the problem says that CuO is formed. So, when SO2 reacts with copper, maybe it's a redox reaction. Let me think: 2 Cu + SO2 → 2 CuO + S. So for every 2 moles of Cu, 1 mole of SO2 reacts, producing 2 moles of CuO and 1 mole of S. 

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact reaction. Alternatively, another possibility is that when SO2 is passed over hot copper, it gets oxidized. Hmm. Let's think about the amount. The mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80g. So if the product is CuO, which has a molar mass of 80 g/mol (Cu is ~63.55, O is 16, so total 79.55 ≈80). So 0.80g of CuO would be 0.01 moles. So if the reaction is 2 Cu + SO2 → 2 CuO + S, then for each mole of SO2, we get 2 moles of CuO. Because in the reaction equation, 1 mole of SO2 produces 2 moles of CuO. So 0.80g is 0.01 moles of CuO. So that would mean 0.005 moles of SO2 reacted. Because each mole of SO2 gives 2 moles of CuO. So 0.01 moles CuO comes from 0.005 moles SO2.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is different. Let me check other possibilities. For example, if the SO2 is oxidized to SO3, but I don't think that's the case here because SO3 would require more O2, which isn't
