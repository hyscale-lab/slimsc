Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about some process happening in the immune system after a rotavirus experiment. Hmm.

Alright, the setup: They tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, they saw some fluorescence destroyed in the stomach, probably because of acid. Others got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They found fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and found high variability. So, what's going on here.

Wait, so the key point is the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. I remember that variation in the immune system is usually due to a few processes. Let me think: VDJ recombination, somatic hypermutation, class switching. 

VDJ recombination happens during the generation of B cell receptors in the bone marrow, right? It's when the variable, diversity, and joining segments are combined to create the diversity of the B cell receptor. But I think this happens during the early stages, like when the B cells are developing.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cells have been activated. I think this happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. The enzyme AID introduces mutations in the variable regions, which increases the diversity of the antibodies. This is part of affinity maturation.

Class switching recombination is about changing the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), and it's also dependent on signals during activation. It involves recombination of the heavy chain genes but doesn't affect the variable regions as much.

So the experiment: the GFP-tagged proteins were given orally. They ended up in the Peyer patches, which are a type of secondary lymphoid organ. The cells that are proliferating there are probably B cells that have been activated by the antigen.

When you sequence the variable regions and see high variability, that suggests that each B cell has a slightly different variable region, which could mean they underwent hypermutation. Because VDJ would have already happened when the B cells were formed, but if they are in the Peyer patches and have high variability, it's more likely that this is after the initial VDJ.

Also, Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and are a site where antigens from the intestine are sampled. B cells here would encounter the antigen, get activated, and then undergo further processes like hypermutation.

Wait, but when does hypermutation happen? It's during the germinal center reactions. So after the B cells are activated, they form germinal centers where they proliferate and undergo hypermutation. So if they're isolating the proliferating cells from the Peyer patches, which I think are the sites where this happens, then the process is likely somatic hypermutation.

The other options: Complement activation is more about opsonizing the antigen or causing lysis, not directly related to the variability in the genes. Class switching is about changing the isotype, not the variable regions. VDJ is earlier in B cell development.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence data reveal that some proteins were destroyed by stomach acid, while others were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Fluorescent Peyer patches were identified, and proliferating cells isolated from these patches showed high variability in their variable heavy chain genes upon sequencing. This suggests a process that generates diversity in the variable regions of B cell receptors.

Key processes to consider are:

1. **VDJ Recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to form the B cell receptor. However, this process occurs before the B cells enter secondary lymphoid tissues, so it is unlikely to explain the observed variability in the Peyer patches.

2. **Somatic Hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers, where activated B cells undergo mutations in the variable regions of their receptors. These mutations increase the diversity of the immune response and are consistent with the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes. Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, where germinal centers can form, making this the most plausible explanation.

3. **Class Switching Recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variable regions of the heavy chain. It is unrelated to the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

4. **Complement Activation**: This process involves opsonization or lysis of antigens but does not directly contribute to the variability in B cell receptor genes.

Given the context of the experiment and the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes, the process most likely occurring is **somatic hypermutation**, which explains the increased diversity in the B cell receptors after antigen activation in the Peyer patches.
