Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

Compound A is C3H6. Hmm, that formula could be either propene or propane. Oh wait, wait. C3H6. Propene is C3H6 (since propene is CH2=CHCH3, which has 3 carbons and 6 hydrogens). Propane is C3H8, so A must be propene. Because the formula is C3H6, it's either propene (alkene) or cyclopropane, but I think it's more likely propene because the next step is bromination. Bromination of alkenes would typically be an addition reaction.

So, compound A (propene) undergoes bromination in the presence of CCl4. Oh, right, that's a typical bromination condition using a non-polar solvent, which is probably a free radical addition. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. No, wait. No, when you have an alkene and you brominate it with Br2, it's an addition reaction. The bromine adds across the double bond. So, propene, which is CH2=CHCH3, when it reacts with Br2, would add Br across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or, wait, let me think. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it would add across the double bond. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Or maybe it's 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but the structure of propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would give CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait, no. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it adds across the double bond, so the product would be CH2BrCHBrCH3. Wait, but that's 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Oh, alcoholic KOH is a strong base, and it's probably undergoing an elimination reaction. Since B is a vicinal dihalide (two bromines on adjacent carbons), when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate to form an alkene. So the product would be propene again? Wait, no. Wait, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you eliminate, you lose two HBr molecules. So, the structure would be CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, elimination would form CH2=CHCH3 again. So perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. So compound C is propene again.

Wait, but wait. Wait, if you have 1,2-dibromopropane reacting with alcoholic KO
