Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about reaction mechanisms and predicting major products. I need to think through each step carefully because I'm still a bit shaky on some of these concepts.

Alright, the problem has two separate reactions, A and B, and I have to choose the correct products from the given options. Let me tackle them one by one.

First, reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacts with THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. H+ is probably a proton source, maybe in workup.

So, the starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro means it has two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the alcohol group. The structure is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached. The spiro part is between a 3 and a 5-membered ring, I think.

Reaction conditions are with a strong base, THF, and then H+. Wait, what's the typical reaction when a spiro compound is treated with a strong base? Oh, right! The Cope elimination comes to mind. Cope elimination involves the base deprotonating a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a conjugated diene. But wait, this starting material has a vinyl group, so maybe it's more about a hydride shift or some kind of ring-opening or cyclization.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's an example of a Norrish type reaction? No, Norrish is more about ketones and cleavage. Alternatively, considering the spiro structure, perhaps the base induces some kind of ring-opening or formation of a larger ring.

Wait, the molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So it's an alcohol with a double bond and a spiro arrangement. When you treat with a strong base like KH, which is a source of H- (but wait, no, KH is K-H, and in THF it's a strong base, but maybe it's acting as a base by deprotonating something).

Wait, maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition or elimination. Alternatively, could it be a pinacol-like rearrangement? Pinacol rearrangement involves vicinal diols, but
