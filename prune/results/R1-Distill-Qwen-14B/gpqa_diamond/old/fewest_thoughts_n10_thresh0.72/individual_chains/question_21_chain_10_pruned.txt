Alright, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, let's read it carefully.

The question talks about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Then it asks about two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It says one of them does not show tautomerism, which is part A of the question. Then, for part B, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Hmm. So I need to figure out part A and part B separately and then match the options.

Starting with part A: The compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. The question is about tautomerism. Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen and a shift of bonds, often between carbonyl groups and hydroxyl groups, like in keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Does it have any hydrogens that can tautomerize? Well, quinones are typically more about conjugated double bonds. In benzoquinone, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups across from each other. So it's O=C6H4-C=O, but wait, no, actually benzoquinone has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons in the ring. Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups in para positions. So like, positions 1 and 4. So it's O=C6H4-C=O. But wait, can that undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism requires the possibility of a hydrogen moving from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to a keto-enol form.

But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene ring. So
