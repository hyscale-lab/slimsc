Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and another compound A, resulting in 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out which reagent A and catalyst B are used.

First, I'll try to understand the reaction. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, a five-membered ring with one nitrogen and a methyl group on the third position. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl is like a cyclohexane ring attached via a CH₂ group, but with a double bond—so maybe it's a cyclohexenyl group? Or perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring where one of the rings is a double bond.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is at the 1-position of the pyrrolidine ring. The substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl, which is (cyclohexylidene)methyl. Cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, perhaps, like a cyclohexene substituent. Or wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring attached via a CH₂ group, but that CH₂ is part of a double bond. So it's a cyclohexylidene group attached to a methylene (CH₂) group. So maybe the structure is something like CH₂ connected to a cyclohexene ring.

So, what kind of reaction would form such a product from 3-methylpyrrolidine? Since it's an acid-catalyzed reaction, I'm thinking of reactions that use acid as a catalyst, like maybe some kind of addition or substitution.

Looking at the options, compound A is either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. The catalysts are TsOH or acetic acid. TsOH is p-toluenesulfonic acid, which is a strong acid catalyst, often used in reactions where a lot of acid is needed, like in some eliminations or certain addition reactions.

So, the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. Let me think about the possible reactions.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has a five-membered ring with a methyl branch. When it reacts with compound A under acid conditions, it forms this new substituent. So, perhaps it's a ring-opening followed by some addition, or maybe a substitution.

Another thought: perhaps this is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, pyrrolidine is an amine, which is a nucleophile. Friedel-Crafts typically uses aromatic rings as the electrophilic component, but pyrrolidine isn't aromatic. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, could this be a Mannich reaction? Mannich involves amines, ketones, and aldehydes. But the product here doesn't look like a Mannich base.
