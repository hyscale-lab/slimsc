Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm.

Wait, right, the particles are spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state, including spin. But since the potential is one-dimensional, each particle has a quantum number n and a spin state. Oh, right, because spin is another quantum number, so for each spatial state, there are two possible spin states (up and down).

The well has length L, and the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Or, as the problem states, E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each level is E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E.

Now, since it's a one-dimensional infinite potential well, each particle is in a state with some n. But because the particles are identical fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion. So each spatial state can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down). Wait, no—actually, each unique spatial wavefunction can hold two particles, each with opposite spins.

So with four particles, we need to figure out how to fill up the lowest energy states without violating the Pauli principle.

Let me think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. Since each n can hold two particles, let's see:

n=1 can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more. But wait, four particles. So the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2. So in that case, all four are filled up to n=2. So the energies would be the sum of each state's energy multiplied by the number of particles in that state.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each particle. So for each particle, their energy is E_n for their respective n. So if two particles are in n=1, each contributes E_1 = E*(1)^2 = E. Two particles in n=2, each contributes E_2 = E*(2)^2=4E. So total energy is (2*E) + (2*4E) = 2E +8E=10E. Wait, but the options have 4E as an option sometimes. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies for four identical particles. Each particle has spin-1/2, which I remember means they can have spin up or down. Since they're identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh right, that's the one where no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

So first, let's recall the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well. The energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which the problem defines as E multiplied by n squared. So E = (π² ħ²)/(2mL²), so E_n = n² E.

Wait, but for four fermions, each with spin-1/2, each particle can have two possible spin states (up or down). So each spatial state (a particular n) can hold two fermions with different spins. So the maximum number of particles that can occupy the same spatial state is two.

Now, the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have spin up or down. So for each n, two particles can occupy that state with different spins.

We need to arrange four particles into the lowest possible energy states. Let's go step by step.

Ground State:
The lowest energy state is when the particles are in the lowest possible energy levels. Since each level can hold two particles, the first two particles go into n=1 with spins up and down. Then, the next two go into n=2. But wait, wait. Let me think again. Each n can hold two particles, so n=1 can take two, n=2 can take two. But four particles would fill n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). So their energies would be (1² + 1² + 2² + 2²) E? Wait, no, each particle's energy is n² E, so the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, no! Wait a second. No, that
