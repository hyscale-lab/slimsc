Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The problem goes like this: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate to give product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, leading to product 3. The question is asking how many carbon atoms are in product 3, with options from A to D.

First, I need to figure out what each step does. Let's break it down.

Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde plus methylmagnesium bromide.

Hmm, trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached. Its structure is CH₂=CH-C₆H₄-CHO, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. So the structure is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No wait, no. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that's not right. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO, but trans-cinnamaldehyde would have a double bond, so it's actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. No, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde, and the structure is benzene ring attached to a propenal group. So it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think: cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO, but wait, no, the correct structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO is actually benzylacetaldehyde. Oh wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: Cinnamaldehyde has the structure where the benzene ring is attached to a propenyl group. So it's benzaldehyde with a double bond. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that's not right. Wait, actually, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me visualize
