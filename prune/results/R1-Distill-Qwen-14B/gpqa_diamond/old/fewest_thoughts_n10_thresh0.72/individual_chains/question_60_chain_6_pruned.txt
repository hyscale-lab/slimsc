Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about space travel and time dilation, I think. Okay, let me read the question again carefully.

So, there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. The question is about how long it will take for a 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, so the astronaut is 22 years old when they start the journey, and we're supposed to find out from their perspective how much time passes for them to reach Earth. But wait, the spacecraft is moving at a high speed, so time dilation effects might come into play. Right, because according to Einstein's theory of relativity, time moves slower for an object moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to another object.

But wait, wait. The question says, "from the point of view of the astronaut." So, the astronaut's own experienced time is what we're looking for. So, we're dealing with the proper time, which is the time measured in the moving frame (the spacecraft's frame) where the astronaut is at rest.

But first, I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Because without knowing the distance, I can't calculate the time. Wait, but the problem probably assumes that the distance is known or maybe it's a standard figure. Alternatively, maybe the problem isn't about calculating the actual distance but using time dilation based on the speed given.

Wait, I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The distance from the LMC to Earth is about 160,000 light-years. So, that's approximately 160,000 years if you were traveling at light speed. But obviously, this spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, which is
