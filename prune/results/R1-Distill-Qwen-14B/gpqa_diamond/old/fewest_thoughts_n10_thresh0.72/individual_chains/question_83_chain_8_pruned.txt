Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.

Alright, first things first, I need to understand what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. The reaction equation should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the acetic acid reacts with sodium hydroxide to form sodium acetate and water.

First step: Calculate the concentrations after dilution. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. The concentration of acetic acid after dilution can be found using the dilution formula.

Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid in solution: volume is 40 cm³ (since we diluted 20 to 40), so moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed at equivalence point is moles / Molarity = 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, wait, wait. Because when you dilute the acetic acid, the moles are (0.02 L * 0.05 M) = 0.001 mol. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Oh wait no, wait, no, after dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L, and the concentration is 0.025 M, so moles = 0.04 * 0.025 = 0.001 mol. So yeah, NaOH needed is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So at equivalence point, the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

So to find the pH at equivalence point, I need to calculate the pH of a sodium acetate solution. The concentration of sodium acetate can be found by considering the dilution. The volume at equivalence is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ total. So moles of sodium acetate is 0.001 mol (since each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH to form one mole of sodium acetate). So concentration is 0.001 mol /0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid. Since Ka = 1.85e-5, then Kw/Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. So Kb is about 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait: Wait, let me calculate that accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 is equal to (1e-14 ) / (1.85e-5) = (1
