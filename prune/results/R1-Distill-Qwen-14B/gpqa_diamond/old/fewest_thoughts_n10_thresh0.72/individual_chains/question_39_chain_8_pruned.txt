Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it. So the question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function. Let me read it again.

We have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, and i is the imaginary unit, sqrt(-1). But when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region, right?

Wait, no, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But that's for a part of space where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero elsewhere, but we don't have to worry about that because the measurements show particles only in that region.

The key thing here is that wave functions must be normalized. The integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. So I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1 to find 'a'.

Let me write down the wave function: ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. Wait, that's an interesting form because it's a combination of a real and imaginary part. So the absolute square would be
