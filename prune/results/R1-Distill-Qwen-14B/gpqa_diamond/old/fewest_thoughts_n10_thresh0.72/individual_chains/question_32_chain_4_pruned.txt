Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei or something. But wait, the question is about a nucleus X, which is lithium with 3 neutrons. Oh, right, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because the atomic number is 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number is 6. So the mass of each nucleus would be the mass of Li-6.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96 times the speed of light.

Wait, relativistic energy... right. The total energy E is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So first, I'll calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me compute that. Let me write down the formula: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). 

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate this more accurately.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.571428... Hmm, but maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me double-check: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. Because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.571428... So
