Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. Let me take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. So it's a cyclohexanone ring. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH attached. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is also known as isopropenyl, right? So that's like a CH2-C(CH2)=CH2 group? Wait, wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at 1. Let me think. Oh wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-? Wait, no. The substituent is attached at position 2. Oh wait, the structure is CH2-C(=CH2)-. So it's probably an allyl group. So the substituent at position 5 is an isopropenyl group, which is a substituted vinyl group.

So the starting molecule has a cyclohexanone ring, substituents at 3 and 5. Now, the first step is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So I think this is an alkylation reaction. The starting material has a hydroxymethyl group, which is an -OH attached to a CH2 group. But wait, the -OH is on a cyclohexane ring that's a ketone. So the position is 3: 3-(hydroxymethyl). So the structure is cyclohexanone with substituents at 3 (hydroxymethyl) and 5 (isopropenyl).

In the presence of a strong base like Na

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. Let me think through each step carefully.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at position 5. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group attached at the 2nd carbon, so it's CH₂CH₂CH₂ but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH₂CH=CH₂ attached via the middle carbon. So it's an isopropenyl group, right? So position 5 has an isopropenyl substituent.

First step: treatment with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation. In the presence of a ketone, like cyclohexanone here, the alpha protons are acidic. Deprotonating would form an enolate. Then, benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So the enolate would attack the benzyl bromide, leading to alkylation at the alpha position.

Wait, the starting compound already has substituents at carbons 3 and 5. The ketone is at position 1. So the alpha carbons are at positions 2 and 6 because that's adjacent to the carbonyl (which is at 1). But the substituents are at 3 and 5. So the enolate would form at either 2 or 6.

Wait, the starting structure is 3-hydroxymethyl, 5-isopropenyl, and the carbonyl is at 1. So the alpha positions are 2 and 6. Let me imagine the ring. Carbon 1 is the carbonyl, so positions 2 and 6 are alpha. The hydroxymethyl is at 3, so that's next to position 2. The enolate could form at 2 or 6.

But if we deprotonate alpha to the carbonyl, the enolate would attack the benzyl bromide. So the alkylation occurs at either position 2 or 6. Wait, but the starting material already has some substituents. For example, position 3 has a hydroxymethyl, so perhaps the enolate forms at position 2, which is adjacent to 3. Alternatively, position 6 is less substituted but perhaps more accessible.

Alternatively, maybe the enolate forms at position 2, which is next to the 3-hydroxymethyl. So when benzyl bromide is added, the benzyl group attaches to position 2. So after alkylation, the product 1 would have a benzyl group at position 2, a hydroxymethyl at 3, and the isopropenyl at 5. So the ring would have substituents at 2 (benzyl), 3 (OHCH₂), and 5 (isopropenyl), with the ketone at 1.

Wait, but after alkylation, the ketone is still present. So product 1 would have a benzyl group added to the alpha position, so either 2 or 6. Let me think about the structure. The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. After alkylation, the new substituent is at position 2, so maybe the structure becomes 2-benzyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Second step: product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic HCl to form product 2. Oh, I remember that the Curtius rearrangement involves treating a carbonyl with hydrazine derivatives. Alternatively, p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) hydrazide is used in the formation of hydrazones, which can undergo various reactions. Wait, but in this case, since it's a ketone, the reaction would form a hydrazone.

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, perhaps it forms a hydrazone. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait! Tosyl chloride is used for making tosylates, but here it's p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. So in the presence of HCl, maybe it's a way to activate the hydrazide. So, the ketone would react with the hydrazide to form a hydrazone.

In product 1, we have a ketone at position 1. So when product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and HCl, it would form a hydrazone. The ketone (RCOR') becomes RCONHNHTs. So product 2 is a hydrazone derivative of the ketone in product 1.

Third step: product 2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3. Hmm, n-BuLi is a strong base and a good nucleophile. When used with hydrazones, I'm trying to recall. There's a reaction where hydrazones can undergo deprotonation and then some kind of elimination or addition.

Wait, another possibility: the hydrazone could undergo the Wolff-Kishner reaction. But Wolff-Kishner usually involves heating with a strong base like NH2NH2 and a catalyst, typically under high heat to eliminate the hydrazone and form an alkane. But here, the conditions are different. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a carbene or some addition.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrazone undergoes a 1,2-addition. Wait, in the presence of a strong base like n-BuLi, perhaps the hydrazone's carbon is attacked. Let me think: the hydrazone has a C=N-N-Ts group. The adjacent carbon (the alpha carbon) might be deprotonated. Then, maybe n-BuLi acts as a base, abstracting a proton alpha to the hydrazone. Then, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming a carbanion, which could then capture something else?

Wait, another possibility: the hydrazone could undergo a conjugate addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to form an enamine or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, after forming the hydrazone (product 2), treating with n-BuLi might deprotonate the alpha position. The hydrazone has a structure where the carbonyl is replaced by a C=N-N-Ts group. The alpha carbons are adjacent to this group, so they're acidic. So n-BuLi would deprotonate one of these alpha positions, forming an enolate-like structure. Then, perhaps the base could induce a reaction.

Wait, but after deprotonation, the enolate could attack somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe a hydride shift or some rearrangement happens. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrazone group is displaced.

Wait, another thought: the hydrazone might form
