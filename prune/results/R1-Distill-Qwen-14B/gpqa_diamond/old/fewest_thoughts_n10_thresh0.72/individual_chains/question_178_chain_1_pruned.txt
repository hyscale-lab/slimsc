Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it.

The question is about the Lagrangian L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. They gave σ_{μν} as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I remember is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. 

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. Then, determine if the theory is renormalizable.

I think I should start by recalling how to find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless because when you integrate it over spacetime (which has dimension 4 in 4D spacetime), the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, since [d^4x] is [Mass]^-4.

So, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's break it down. The field ψ is a spinor, so its mass dimension is [ψ] = 3/2. Because in 4D, the Dirac field has dimension 3/2. Since ψ̄ is the adjoint, same dimension. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. But wait, σ_{μν} is made of gamma matrices. Each γ has dimension 1, I think. So σ_{μν} is a product of two gammas, so dimension 2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) *2 (from two ψ's) multiplied by σ's dimension 2? Wait, no. Wait, ψ̄ is a row vector, σ is a matrix, and ψ is a column vector. The product is a scalar. So each ψ contributes 3/2, and σ contributes 2. So ψ̄ σ ψ → (3/2) + (3/2) + 2? Wait, no, I think the way to compute dimensions is to add the dimensions of each field in the term. So each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimension 3 (since (3/2)*2 + 2?). No, wait, maybe I should think of each part:

The spinor terms: ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2, so the product ψ̄ ψ would be 3. But wait, σ_{μν} is a tensor made from gamma matrices. Wait, but in terms of dimension, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices, each with dimension 1. So [σ_{μν}] = 1 + 1 = 2. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimension [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] = (3/2) + (2) + (3/2) = 4. So the entire term is [κ] + 4. Because the Lagrangian term is dimensionless, so [κ] +4 =4 → [κ] =0? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σψ F^{μν}. So I also need to consider F^{μν}.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Its dimensions, what's [F]?

In electromagnetism, the field strength tensor F_{μν} has dimensions of [mass]^2. Because the Maxwell Lagrangian is (1/4) F^2, which has to have dimension 4. So F^2 must have dimension 4 → F has dimension 2.

So in our term, the product
