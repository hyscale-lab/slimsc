Okay, so I have this question about absorption lines in the Milky Way and what kind of interstellar medium they're coming from. Hmm. Let me think about what I know.

The question says that observations are at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs. Wait, but the absorption lines are detected in the Milky Way? Oh, right, because the question is about what would be observed in the Milky Way with these absorption lines.

The energy equivalent of the absorption line is 3.9 micro electron volts. Micro is 1e-6, so 3.9e-6 eV. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by E = hc/lambda. But wait, I'm more interested in what kind of interstellar medium produces absorption lines with this energy.

I think different types of interstellar mediums have different temperatures and densities, which affect the energy of the absorption lines. Like, for example, the interstellar medium (ISM) has different phases: warm, cold atomic, cold molecular, etc.

Cold clouds, like molecular clouds, are really dense and cold. I think their typical temperatures are just a few Kelvin. How does that relate to the energy of the absorption lines? Well, the energy of the photons involved in the absorption lines depends on the transitions between energy levels of atoms or molecules.

If the clouds are cold, that might mean that the thermal energies are low, so the atoms or molecules can't have high excitation energies. So the absorption lines would be from lower energy transitions, which correspond to longer wavelengths (lower energy photons). But wait, what about the typical energies for certain
