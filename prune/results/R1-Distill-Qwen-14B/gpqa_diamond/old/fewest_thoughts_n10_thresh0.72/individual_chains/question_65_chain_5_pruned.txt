Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and then H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is tetrahydrofuran, often used as a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. Wait, but when they add H+ later, maybe it's a workup step.

Looking at the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. Here, it's a spiro with a 3-carbon and a 5-carbon ring. The structure probably has a double bond at position 5 of the nonane chain, and a vinyl group attached to the first carbon. So, it's like a bicyclic compound with a bridge.

When you treat an alcohol with a strong base like KH, I think it's deprotonation. But wait, in THF, which is a solvent, maybe it's a more specific reaction. Alternatively, I've heard that vinyl ethers can undergo elimination under certain conditions. Or maybe it's about ring-opening or ring-forming reactions.

Wait, another thought—maybe this is a Cope elimination. The Cope elimination involves the base-induced elimination of a hydrogen adjacent to an oxygen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, the starting material already has a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed process, but here the base is involved.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is undergoing some kind of cyclization. The structure is a spiro compound, so perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to a ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, 1-vinylspiro suggests that there's a bridgehead alcohol. So if the base abstracts a proton from the adjacent carbon to the OH, which is a good leaving group (since it's an alcohol, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps it becomes a better leaving group via deprotonation).

Wait, but the reaction is with KH in THF, which is a polar aprotic solvent, and then H+ is added. So maybe it's an elimination followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the structure is a spiro with a five-membered ring and a three-membered ring? Or wait, the spiro notation is [n.m], so 3 and 5, meaning the rings are 3 and 5 membered? So, a bridge where two rings (3 and 5 carbons) are joined at a single atom.

The starting alcohol is at position 1. So the structure has a bridgehead alcohol and a vinyl group.

When treated with a strong base like KH, which is a strong deprotonating agent, it might abstract a proton adjacent to the oxygen. Once deprotonated, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming a double bond. But wait, there's already a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps this leads to a ring-opening or ring-closing. Another possibility is that the base abstracts a proton, leading to a conjugated base which undergoes some kind of cyclization.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of a ketone. Because if the base deprotonates and then a proton is abstracted from a position that allows a ring to form, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: the spiro compound could undergo a retro-aldol type cleavage, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a keto-enol type tautomerism, but I don't see a clear path.

Wait, let me think about the reaction conditions. THF is a good solvent for such reactions, and KH is a strong base which can deprotonate alcohols. But then, the H+ step—perhaps it's a workup to protonate any enolates or to form a ketone.

Wait, if the
