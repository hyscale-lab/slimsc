Okay, so I need to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, that's a harmonic oscillator potential. I remember that in three dimensions, the potential for a harmonic oscillator can be written in terms of the radial distance r. 

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue. Hmm. 

First, I think about the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in three dimensions, each energy level depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, actually, for the 3D isotropic case, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n, which is related to the sum of the quantum numbers in the x, y, and z directions. Oh wait no, wait. Alternatively, maybe in spherical coordinates, the energy depends on the radial quantum number and the angular momentum quantum number.

Wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels for the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be thought of as being determined by the sum of the quantum numbers. Let me think: For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is given by E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0,1,2,...). Wait, no, wait. Or perhaps each direction (x, y, z) contributes a harmonic oscillator, so the total energy is the sum of each direction's energy. Each direction has energy (n_x + 1/2)ħω, so total E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω. Alternatively, the principal quantum number n is such that n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

But wait, sometimes the principal quantum number is taken as n = 2l + n_r + 1, maybe? Or perhaps in the radial part, the energy depends on the radial quantum number n_r and the angular momentum quantum number l. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

In the 3D case, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which is similar to three
