Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electromagnetism and radiation concepts. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle, which is a function f of lambda and the angle theta from the z-axis. The maximum power is given as A, and I need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees and the form of f.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic waves. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroid along the z-axis, the radiation should have some symmetry around that axis. I think this is similar to a dipole antenna or something like that.

Wait, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) is proportional to (sin^2 theta), where theta is the angle from the dipole's axis. So the intensity pattern is maximum at theta = 90 degrees and zero along the axis (theta=0 and 180).

But wait, that's for an ideal dipole. However, the problem here mentions an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid. So maybe it's similar to an electric dipole but with some specific orientation.

The problem says that the maximum power is A. So the maximum occurs when the intensity is highest. For a dipole, maximum intensity is at theta = 90 degrees. But in this problem, they are asking about theta = 30 degrees, which is not the maximum.

Wait, but the question isn't directly about the pattern, but about the function f. The function f is the power per unit solid angle, which depends on lambda and theta. I'm supposed to find the form of f and the fraction at 30 degrees.

Hmm, also, the options give possible dependencies on lambda: lambda^-4, lambda^-3, etc. So I think I need to recall how the radiation intensity depends on wavelength.

Wait, the radiated power per unit solid angle, I think, is a function that depends
