Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, right. I remember that when alkenes are heated, especially with certain structures, they can undergo rearrangements, maybe like a hydride shift or some kind of isomerism.

Wait, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene... Let me try to draw that structure. Nona means nine carbons. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6, and there's a butyl group at position 5. So, position 5 would have a four-carbon branch. Let me number the main chain. So, the main chain is nine carbons long, with double bonds starting at C2 and C6.

So, the structure would be something like this: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, no. Wait, but wait, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. So, the double bonds are between C2-C3 and C6-C7. The substituent is butyl at C5.

Wait, I think I should draw this out. The main chain has nine carbons. The substituent is on C5. So, C5 has a butyl group attached. So, the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5       6   7
