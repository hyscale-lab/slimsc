Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

So, there are five exoplanets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, and they have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They're in orbital resonance and were discovered using the TTV method. Oh wait, TTV is transit timing variations, right? That's a method used to detect planets by observing changes in the timing of a planet's transit. But I think that's not directly important for the question.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of these planets. It says they have the same albedo, so albedo isn't a factor here. Equilibrium temperature depends on a few things—like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since albedo is the same, the main factor here is the distance.

Wait, but how does that relate to orbital periods? Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the radius, so P² ∝ a³. 

But the question gives the periods in a ratio. So let's think about the formula for equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature (T) is given by:

T = T_sun * (L_star / L_sun)^(1/4) * (a / 1 AU) ^(-1/2)

Assuming all planets are around the same star, L_star / L_sun is a constant, so it cancels out. Then the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse of the semi-major axis. So T ∝ a^(-1/2) or (1/a)^(1/2).

But since we're comparing planets, maybe it's easier to use the ratio of their periods to find the ratio of their distances, and then use that to find the temperature ratio.

Wait, because Kepler's third law is P² ∝ a³, so a ∝ P^(2/3). So if I have the period ratios, I can find the a ratios.

Given the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let's assign the values as
