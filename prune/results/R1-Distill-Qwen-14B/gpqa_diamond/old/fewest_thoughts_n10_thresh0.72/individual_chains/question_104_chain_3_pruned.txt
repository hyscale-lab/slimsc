Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. Let's read it again.

So, there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method was used, and they measured the periodic shift of spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The velocity of the star (wobble) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula here.

I think the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (P) is something like K = (v) = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ). But wait, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the denominator becomes (M_* )^(2/3) * (1 + ... )^(1/3) ≈ M_*^(2/3). So the formula simplifies a bit.

But wait, maybe a simpler approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)). Because for a given planet mass and star mass, K depends on the orbital period. But wait, no, let me think again. Alternatively, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / (a^ (1/3) )) ), where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, Kepler's third law relates a^3 to P^2, so a is proportional to P^(2/3). So substituting that into K's formula, K would be proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / ( (P^(2/3) )^(1/3) )) ) = (M_p / M_*) * P^(-2/9) )? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the formula for K.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) * (P^(1/3)) ) ] * (1 / (2π c)) )

But given that M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So,

K ≈ (G^(1/3) * M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) / (2π c )

But since sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, but
