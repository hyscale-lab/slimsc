Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2. That's (18-10)/2 = 8/2 = 4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring plus double bonds or something similar. Maybe two rings, but more likely one ring and a double bond, and perhaps an aromatic ring.

The NMR data is provided. Let's look at that:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet integrating for 1 proton. High field? Wait, no, 9.7 is actually a downfield shift. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like from phenol, but that's more around 5 ppm, unless it's de-shielded. Or maybe it's an amide, but that's typically lower. Hmm, maybe an aldehyde. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) – that's a doublet, 2H. Aromatic protons. If it's a para-substituted benzene, then two doublets would be the case. Similarly, 6.51 (d, 2H) – another doublet, 2H. So maybe two aromatic rings, each with substituents, perhaps. Or maybe one aromatic ring with substituents.

Wait, but wait, 6.98 and 6.51, each as doublets. So for example, in a para-substituted benzene, two sets of doublets. Alternatively, perhaps each is part of a different ring. Let me think. The integration is 2H each, so maybe two aromatic rings each with two protons. But wait, each ring typically would have more than two protons unless substituted. So perhaps each ring is substituted in such a way that only two protons are present as a doublet.

Wait, perhaps we're looking at a benzene ring with two substituents, each substituent causing two equivalent protons. For instance, if a benzene ring has two substituents in para positions, each substituent would split the ring into two sets of protons. But the shifts are different, so maybe the substituents are different. Or perhaps each substituent is a meta director, and the substitution pattern is such that each set of protons is in a different environment.

Alternatively, maybe it's two benzene rings connected to the same carbon or something. Hmm.

Looking further, the NMR shows 6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an acidic proton, or perhaps an aromatic ring with adjacent substituents causing coupling that's not observed, or maybe it's allylic protons. But the broadness is interesting. Could it be a vinylic proton? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents that cause some broadening.

Then 3.66 (d, 2H) – a doublet, 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an ether, or an ester, or an amine. But in the formula, we have O and N. So perhaps an oxygen, like an OCH2 group or something similar.

Putting this together: the molecule has an aldehyde group (if the 9.72 peak is that), two aromatic rings (the two doublets), some CH2, and perhaps an oxygen elsewhere.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures.

The reagents applied are: first, NaNO2 and HCl. Then H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat.

Wait, that's the reaction sequence. Let me think about what each reagent does.

NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization. That's usually done with aryl amines. So if the molecule has an aromatic amine, like aniline, then under cold HCl and NaNO2, it forms a diazonium salt.

Then, H2O – that could be a simple hydrolysis step. Or perhaps it's a substitution using H2O as a nucleophile. But wait, the next step is aqueous KOH and heat, which is a typical condition for elimination reactions, like the formation of an enol or ketone after a substitution, or perhaps it's for a Hofmann or some other elimination.

But wait, what's the initial structure? Let me think. The NMR has an aldehyde proton, so perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group. But the presence of N and O in the formula suggests maybe the molecule has an amino group and an oxygen-containing group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the possible degrees of unsaturation again. So (2*8 + 2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-10)/2 = 4. So four degrees: maybe one ring (like benzene, which is 3), plus one double bond (like an aldehyde or a double bond in a chain), so
