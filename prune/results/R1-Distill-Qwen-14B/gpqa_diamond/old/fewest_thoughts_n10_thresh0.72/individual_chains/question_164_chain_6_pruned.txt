Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, so the problem is about binary star systems and their masses. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with certain periods. System_1's period is 2 years, and system_2's is 1 year. The periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. So that's the orbital period for each system, I think.

Then there's spectroscopic data about radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I remember that radial velocity variations in binary stars are due to the Doppler effect as the stars orbit each other. The amplitude of these variations relates to the mass of the other star in the system, I think.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So we need to find the mass of each system and then take the ratio.

Wait, so the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses. So system_1's mass is M1 = m1 + m2, and system_2's is M2 = m3 + m4.

But how do I find the masses from the RV data? I recall that in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude. Because the more massive object has a smaller orbit. Oh right, because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the less massive star moves more, hence higher velocity.

The formula I remember is that the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. So v1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * V, where V is the orbital speed of the center of mass. Wait no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the velocity semi-amplitude.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (2Ï€ G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )) ), but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, I've heard that the ratio of the velocities is equal to the inverse ratio of the masses. So if star A has velocity v1 and star B has v2, then v1 / v2 = m2 / m1.

Wait, let me think. Since the center of mass is at the balance point, m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. And since the orbital period is the same for both, their velocities are proportional to their orbital radii. So velocity v is proportional to a. So m1 * v1 = m2 * v2. So v1/v2 = m2/m1.

So, from the given RV amplitudes, we can find the mass ratio. For each system, the two stars' velocity amplitudes are given. Let's take system_1 first.

System_1: v1 =10 km/s
