Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the problem is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound is made up of five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The intact gene sequence is given, and then there are four mutants with changes in the first exon area. We need to figure out which mutation would likely let them get rid of the compound. So the goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a loss-of-function mutation.

In genetics, when a gene has a mutation that disrupts its function, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift leading to a nonfunctional protein, it can eliminate the compound. Alternatively, maybe a missense mutation that changes an amino acid critical for the compound's synthesis.

Looking at the sequences:

The intact gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon, methionine). Then there's TTT, CTG, etc.

Mutant 1: The sequence starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT... so comparing to the intact, the first change is at position... Let me see. The intact gene has TTTCTCGCTGGTAC. Wait, let me parse them.

Wait, the intact gene's first part is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
Mutant 1 is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.
Hmm, looking at the first regions:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Wait, perhaps I should write out the sequences more clearly.

Looking at each mutant's beginning:

Mutant 1:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, so the first few nucleotides after ATG in the intact gene are TTT. In Mutant 1, it's TTC
