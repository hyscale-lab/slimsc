Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Oh wait, rest-mass energy is mcÂ², right? So M is the rest mass, and its energy is 300 GeV. 

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments have a certain mass ratio and their combined rest mass is 99% of M. So let's break down the given data.

The two fragments: one is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. So m1 = 2 * m2. The sum of their rest masses is 0.99*M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Substituting m1, 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M. 

Wait, but the sum is 99% of M, so 0.99 M. So the initial nucleus had M, and after fission, the two fragments have a combined rest mass of 0.99 M. That means some mass was converted into kinetic energy, right? Because energy and mass are equivalent. 

So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest energy of the two fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the total energy released as kinetic energy is 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. Oh wait, but that's not considering relativistic effects. Hmm, but maybe that's a starting point.

Wait, but the problem is about kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. The question is about the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) T1 approximation.

So I think I need to compute T1 correctly using relativity, then compute the non-relativistic approximation, then find the difference.

But first, let's model the situation.
