Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I might be wrong; maybe it's another method. But I don't think that part matters for solving this problem.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, meaning Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet2. Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so Planet2's temperature is 2.3 times that of Planet3. So, Planet3 is the coldest, Planet1 is the hottest, and Planet2 is in between.

The mass ratios are also given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, so Planet1 is 15% more massive than Planet2. Then, Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, meaning Planet2 is 35% more than Planet3. So, Planet1 is heaviest, Planet3 is the lightest, and Planet2 is in the middle.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Specifically, by what factor is Planet3's period larger? The options are A to D.

Wait, the question also mentions that the albedo for all three is 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo affects how much light a planet reflects, but I think in the equilibrium temperature formula, albedo is a factor. But since all three have the same albedo, maybe that cancels out when taking ratios.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all three planets are around the same star, L is the same for all. And a is the same for all, 0.3. So the only variables are D, the distance, and other factors.

Wait, but the formula can be rearranged to find the relationship between the planets. Let me think. If I take the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets, say Te1 and Te2, it would be ( (L1 (1-a1) )/(D1^2) )^(1/4) divided by the same expression with subscript 2.

But since L and a are the same for all, the ratio becomes (D2^2 / D1^2 )^(1/4). Wait, because when you invert D, so if Te1/Te2 = ( (D2^2) / (D1^2) )^(1/4) ), because when D increases, Te decreases, as the planet is farther away.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the ratios more carefully.

The equilibrium temperature formula is Te =
