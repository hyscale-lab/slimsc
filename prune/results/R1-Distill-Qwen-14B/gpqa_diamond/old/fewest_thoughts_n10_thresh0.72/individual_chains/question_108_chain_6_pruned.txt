Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

First, the question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. And it's a small value of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, right? So m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, or something like that, depending on the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but the problem mentions small m. So maybe m is small compared to something else. I'm a bit confused. Oh, but the paramagnetic coupling term is involved here. I remember that paramagnetism deals with the magnetic effects due to the motion of electrons in a magnetic field. The coupling term probably refers to the interaction energy between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field.

The transition energy here is the energy difference between two states in the hydrogen atom. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the wavelength corresponding to the Balmer series, like the H-alpha line. So the transition is from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, Balmer is n=2 to n=1? Or is it n=3 to n=2? Wait, the Balmer-alpha line is from n=2 to n=1, but H-alpha is actually n=3 to n=2, right? Or wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: hydrogen's visible spectrum lines are part of the Balmer series, which involves transitions down to n=2. So the H-alpha line is n=3 to n=2, and that has a wavelength around 656 nm, which is about 0.656 micrometers. Wait, but the given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486 nm, which I think corresponds to the Balmer-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. Hmm. So the transition energy Î”E would be the energy difference between n=4 and n=2, or n=3 and n=2.

But how does this relate to the problem? Well, the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which is probably the Zeeman
