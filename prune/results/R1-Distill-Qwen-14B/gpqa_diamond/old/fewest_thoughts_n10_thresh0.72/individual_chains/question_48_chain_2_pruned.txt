Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem starts with cyclohexanone. So, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? Its structure is a six-membered ring with one of the carbons double-bonded to an oxygen. Now, the first step is treating it with bromine, which forms product 1.

Wait, I remember that when a ketone reacts with bromine, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. Or wait, maybe it's an enolate formation. Hmm. Oh, wait! Cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens. The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl group. So when you treat a ketone with a brominating agent, like maybe using a base to deprotonate the alpha carbon, it can form an enolate. Then the bromine (which is Br2) would add across the double bond, but wait, wait. Another possibility is that the alpha protons are abstracted, and then bromide adds. Alternatively, maybe it's a dienophile or something. Wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone reacting with bromine in a different condition. Oh! Maybe it's a bromohydrin formation. No, that's usually with something like HBr and water. Or perhaps it's a dibromination. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think.

Alternatively, when ketones react with bromine, they can undergo addition reactions. So, the carbonyl oxygen is attacked by a nucleophile, but wait, bromine is more likely to act as an electrophile. Maybe it's a conjugate addition. Or wait, maybe
