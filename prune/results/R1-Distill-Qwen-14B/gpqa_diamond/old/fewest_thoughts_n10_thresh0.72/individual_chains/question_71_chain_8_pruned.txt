Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about equilibrium temperatures of planets based on their orbital periods. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. 

Wait, the planets are in orbital resonance, so their periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest. The problem says they have the same albedo, so albedo doesn't come into play in the temperature calculation. That simplifies things a bit.

I think the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital radius. But wait, another version of the formula I remember is T = T_star * (L/L_sun)^(1/4) * (a/(1 AU))^-0.5. Oh wait, no, maybe it's more accurate to say that the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the star's luminosity divided by the planet's distance, but considering the inverse square law. 

Alternatively, another approach is that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Because the period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that P² is proportional to a³ if we're considering the same star. Wait, more accurately, P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So, a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, if a planet's distance a is proportional to P^(2/3), then the equilibrium temperature, which is inversely proportional to sqrt(a) (because T is proportional to L/(a²)^(1/4) ) — wait, let me get this straight.

The equilibrium temperature formula I remember is T = T_star * (L_star / L_sun)^(1/4) * (1 / sqrt(a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 - Earth's albedo) )^(1/4) ), but since albedo is the same, that part cancels out. So, T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). 

But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then 1/sqrt(a) is proportional to P^(-1/3). So the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to P^(-1/3). 

So, the ratio of temperatures between two planets would be (P2 / P1)^(-1/3). 

Wait, but wait, I'm getting this a bit confused. Let me think again. Let me write down the relationships.

From Kepler's third law: (P/a³)² = 4π²/(G M), so for the same star, P² is proportional to a³. So, a = k * P^(2/3), where k is some constant.

The equilibrium temperature T is given by:

T = T_eff * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4) 

But since L and sigma and other constants are the same for all planets around the same star, T is
