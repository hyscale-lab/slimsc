Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. The matrix is given as ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. 

Wait, I think the Bloch sphere is used for pure states, right? But this ρ looks like a mixed state because it's a combination of |0> and |1> with equal weights. Each term is an outer product of the basis states, and they're added together and multiplied by 1/2.

So, how do I represent this density matrix in the Bloch sphere coordinates? I remember that for a single qubit, the Bloch vector has three components (x, y, z). The general form of a density matrix for a mixed state can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. 

The density matrix ρ can be written using the Pauli matrices. Oh right! The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix. So, let me expand that. 

The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So, r·σ would be rxσx + ryσy + rzσz. 

Now, let's plug that into the equation. So ρ would be [I + rxσx + ryσy + rzσz]/2. 

But wait, our given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write out what |0><0| and |1><1| are in terms of matrices. 

|0> is [1, 0]^T, so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1> is [0,1]^T, so |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ is (I)/2.

Hmm, so ρ = I/2. Let me compare that with the general form. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set (I + r·σ)/2 equal to I/2, then:

(I + r·σ)/2 = I/2

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives I + r·σ = I. Subtract I from both sides: r·σ = 0.

Which means that rxσx + ryσy + rzσz = 0 matrix. 

What's the only way this can happen? Well, each Pauli matrix is traceless and non-diagonal for σx and σy. The only solution is rx=0, ry=0, rz=0. Because if any of them were non-zero, the matrix r·σ wouldn't be zero. So r must be (0,0,0). 

So the Bloch vector r is at the origin. Looking at the options, that's option C: r=(0,0,0). 

Wait, but what about the identity matrix in the density matrix? Oh right, because when the state is completely mixed, like maximally uncertain, that's when the Bloch vector is zero. Because a completely mixed state can't be expressed as a pure state on the Bloch sphere; it's the center point. 

So yeah, the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This is a mixed state density matrix. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch vector representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Expanding this, we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z\right).
\]

The given density matrix simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), as \(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| = I\). Comparing this with the general form, we find:

\[
\frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = I\). Subtracting \(I\) from both sides yields \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must satisfy \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\), as any non-zero component of \(\mathbf{r}\) would result in a non-zero matrix for \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in qubit space. This represents a maximally mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

The correct answer is:
