Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So the general formula for uncertainty is the square root of the expectation of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation of the operator. That is, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). 

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So our state vector |ψ⟩ is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T.

First, I need to find the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is given by its matrix, I can compute these by applying the matrix to the state and then taking the inner product.

Wait, but wait. Let me write down the matrix for P_z. The matrix for P_z is:

P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ, where ψ is the state vector.

Let me write ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
        [ 1/√2 ]
        [ -1/2 ]

So ψ† would be the conjugate transpose. But since all the elements are real except perhaps the second row, but looking at the state, the elements are all real. So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Now, let's compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Multiplying ψ† with P_z:

Each element of ψ† multiplies the corresponding column of P_z.

So first element of ψ† is -1/2, multiplied by the first column of P_z, which is [ħ, 0, 0]^T. So that gives (-1/2)*ħ.

The second element of ψ† is 1/√2, multiplied by the second column of P_z, which is [0, 0, 0]^T. So that contributes 0.

Third element is -1/2, multiplied by the third column of P_z, which is [0, 0, -ħ]^T. So that gives (-1/2) * (-ħ) = (ħ/2).

So adding all these up: (-1/2) ħ + 0 + (ħ/2) = (-ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. That's interesting.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Let's compute that. Because P_z is a diagonal matrix, P_z² is just [ [ħ², 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, ħ²] ].

So, to find ⟨P_z²⟩, I compute ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, let's compute each term. 

First element of ψ† is -1/2, multiplied by first column of P_z², which is [ħ², 0, 0]^T. So that's (-1/2) * ħ².

Second element is 1/√2 multiplied by the second column of P_z², which is [0, 0, 0]^T. So that's 0.

Third element is -1/2 multiplied by third column of P_z², which is [0, 0, ħ²]^T. So that's (-1/2)*ħ² * (-1) because of the third element? Wait, no. The third column of P_z² is [0,0, ħ²]^T. So the third element of ψ† is -1/2, so when I multiply, it's (-1/2) * (third component of the third column which is ħ², since the rest are 0). So that's (-1/2)* ħ². But wait, no, because each term is element-wise multiplication and sum. Or wait, maybe I should compute the product correctly.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute P_z² ψ first, then take the inner product with ψ†.

Let me try that.

Compute P_z² ψ:

P_z² is diagonal, so each row is zero except the diagonal elements. So each element of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So, the first element of P_z² ψ is (ħ²) * (-1/2) = -ħ² / 2.
Second element: (0) * (1/√2) = 0.
Third element: (-ħ²) * (-1/2) = ħ² / 2.

So P_z² ψ = [ -ħ²/2, 0, ħ²/2 ]^T.

Now, ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

The inner product ψ† (P_z² ψ) is:

(-1/2) * (-ħ²/2) + (1/√2) * 0 + (-1/2) * (ħ²/2).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/(4)
Wait, no. (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) is (1/2)(ħ²/2) ) → ħ²/(4).

Second term is zero.

Third term: (-1/2) * ( ħ²/2 ) = - ħ²/(4).

Adding them together: ħ²/4 + 0 - ħ²/4 = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because ⟨P_z²⟩ is zero? That would mean that the uncertainty is zero. But that doesn't make sense, because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z, so there should be some uncertainty.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute ⟨P_z²⟩ differently. Let's think again.

Wait, another approach: because P_z is diagonal, the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of each component squared, weighted by the probabilities.

Since the state is |ψ⟩ = [a, b, c]^T, the probabilities are |a|^2, |b|^2, |c|^2.

In this case, a = -1/2, so |a|^2 = 1/4. c = -1/2, |c|^2 = 1/4. b = 1/√2, |b|^2 = 1/2.

So, the expectation ⟨P_z²⟩ would be |a|^2 * (first diagonal element of P_z squared) + |c|^2 * (third diagonal element squared) + |b|^2 * (second diagonal element squared).

Because the second diagonal element is zero, its square is zero, so that term is zero.

So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|² (ħ)^2 + |c|² (-ħ)^2 + |b|² * 0^2.

Which simplifies to |a|² ħ² + |c|² ħ².

Because |a|² = |c|² = 1/4:

So that's (1/4) ħ² + (1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Earlier, I thought it was zero, but that must have been a mistake in the matrix multiplication. So the correct approach is to compute it this way, using the probabilities.

So, putting it all together, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ).

We found ⟨P_z⟩ = 0, so ⟨P_z⟩² is zero. Therefore, ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty in \( P_z \), denoted as \( \Delta P_z \), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle P_z \rangle \)
The state vector is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for \( P_z \) is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle P_z \rangle \) is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle.
\]

Since \( P_z \) is diagonal, the computation simplifies to:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

Thus, \( \langle P_z \rangle = 0 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \)
The matrix for \( P_z^2 \) is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle \) is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle.
\]

Again, since \( P_z^2 \) is diagonal, the computation simplifies to:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \hbar^2.
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

Thus, \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 \).

### Step 3: Compute \( \Delta P_z \)
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute \( \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 \) and \( \langle P_z \rangle = 0 \):

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}} \).
