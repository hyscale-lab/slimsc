Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when we talk about excitation, we're usually referring to the number of atoms in a higher energy state versus a lower one. So if they're twice as excited, maybe the population of the upper energy level is higher in star_1 than in star_2.

Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), right? So the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by that exponential.

Let me recall the formula. The ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level (n_upper) to the lower (n_lower) is n_upper/n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Or wait, sometimes it's written as (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). But I think the problem here assumes the same ground level, so the statistical weights (g) might be the same, so it simplifies to the exponential term.

So for star_1, the ratio is n1_upper/n1
