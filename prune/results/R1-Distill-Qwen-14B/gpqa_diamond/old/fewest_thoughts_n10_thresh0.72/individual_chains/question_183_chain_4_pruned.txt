Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product after a reaction. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. So, it's a cyclohexene ring. The numbering is such that there's a formyl group (CHO) at position 2, a vinyl group (CH2-CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- group) at position 5, and a carboxylic acid group at position 3. Wait, no, the cyclohex-3-ene part means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, right? Because the numbering for cyclohexene starts with the double bond between 1 and 2 as position 1. So, in cyclohex-3-ene, the double bond is between 3 and 4.

So the structure: cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, at C2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at C5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). Oh wait, no, the substituents are at positions 2,3,5. Wait, wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the main chain is the cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 3 (since it's cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid). So the substituents are at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached to the ring).

So the starting structure has a cyclohexene ring with three substituents: at C2 (CHO), C3 (COOH), and C5 (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- group attached to the ring. So the substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 5.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, I think that's the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, red phosphorus and HI is usually used
