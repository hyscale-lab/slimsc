Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products based on the reactants and conditions given. Then, I'll match them with the options provided.

Let me take each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

So, dimethyl malonate is the enolate donor. It's a good nucleophile because it's a strong base in the presence of a base like NaOEt. The acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this acceptor would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, wait. Wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the substituent is at the 3-position. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the general structure for an acrylate is CH₂=CHCOOR. But in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the substituent is at the 3 position. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the acrylate is CH₂=CHCOOR. The substituent is at the beta position. Hmm, perhaps I should draw this mentally.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, the carbonyl is C3, and the p-tolyl is on C2. So the structure is CH₂-C(p-tolyl
