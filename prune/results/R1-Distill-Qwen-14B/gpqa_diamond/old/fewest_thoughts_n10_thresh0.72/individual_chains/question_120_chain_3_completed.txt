Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same throughout space. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star that's farther away has a smaller parallax.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let's think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) doesn't change with distance. So let's say the density is n stars per cubic parsec.

Let me model this. Imagine a small shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of this shell would be 4πd² dr, because it's a sphere with radius d and thickness dr. The number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. So substituting, d = 1/plx → dr = -d/(plx^2) d(plx). Wait, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

Let's change variables from d to plx. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. The volume element in terms of plx would be tricky. Alternatively, think about the number of stars per unit parallax range.

Wait, maybe another approach. The number of stars per unit volume is n, so the number in a volume element is n dV. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π d² dd. So number of stars between d and d+dd is n * 4π d² dd.

But we want this in terms of parallax. Let's let plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Then dd is the change in d corresponding to a change in plx, dplx. So dd = -d/(plx^2) dplx. Because plx = 1/d → d plx = -1/d² dd.

Wait, maybe I should express d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. Then, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd), but dd is in terms of dplx. Let me clarify.

We have d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d. So, if I have a small change in plx, dplx, then the corresponding change in d is dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because the derivative of d with respect to plx is dd/dplx = -1/plx².

So, substituting back into the number of stars:

Number of stars = n * 4π d² dd
= n *4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, but dplx is positive when plx increases, which would mean d decreases. Since we're considering a small range in plx, maybe I can take the absolute value, so number of stars per unit plx is the integral over a small dplx.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, thickness dr. The number is n * 4π d² dr.

But I want to find how many stars are in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx. So each plx corresponds to a shell at distance d = 1/plx.

The number of stars in a thin shell at d is n *4π d² dr. But dr is related to dplx. Since plx =1/d → d =1/plx → plx =1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Since dplx is positive when moving to larger plx, which would mean moving to smaller d, dr is negative. But when we take the magnitude, dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, no, the number of stars in the shell should be positive. So substituting dr into the number of stars expression:

n *4π d² dr = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, because dr is positive when plx decreases, but I'm considering a thin shell as plx increases, so perhaps I should take the absolute value.

So, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Let's recalculate.

Wait, no, the substitution is dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Since d is a function of plx, so when plx increases, d decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (1/plx²) dplx. So the thickness of the shell in terms of distance is dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The number of stars would then be:

n *4π d² dr = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

But dr is negative, so maybe I should take the absolute value, so the number is positive.

So the number of stars per unit change in plx (dplx) is:

dN = n *4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) dplx

Wait, that would be n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, but that would make the number of stars per unit plx range proportional to 1/plx^4. But that's option A. But I'm not sure. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, another approach. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = n *4π d² dr.

But dr is the change in r (distance) corresponding to a change in plx. Since plx =1/d, d =1/plx. So if plx changes by dplx, what is dr?

d plx = d (1/d) → d plx = -1/d² dr → dr = -d² d plx.

So, substituting d =1/plx, dr = - (1/plx)^2 d plx.

So, the number of stars N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (- (1/plx)^2 d plx )

But d plx is a positive change, so when plx increases, d decreases. So dr is negative, but the number of stars can't be negative. So perhaps I should take the absolute value.

So, N =n *4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So, the number of stars per unit change in plx is dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that would make the answer A.

But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number density and the differential volume per unit plx.

Another approach: The number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume between parallax plx and plx + dplx is the volume of a sphere with radius (1/plx) minus the sphere up to (1/(plx+dplx)).

Wait, that might be a better approach.

So, the volume at a given plx is V = (4/3) π (1/plx)^3.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx would be the difference between V at plx and V at (plx + dplx).

So,

ΔV = (4/3) π [ (1/plx)^3 - (1/(plx+dplx))^3 ]

Assuming dplx is small, we can approximate using a Taylor expansion.

Let me expand (1/(plx + dplx))^3 around plx.

Let f(plx) = 1/plx^3.

Then, f(plx + dplx) ≈ f(plx) - f’(plx) dplx + (1/2) f''(plx) (dplx)^2 - ...

But since dplx is small, higher-order terms can be neglected. So,

ΔV ≈ (4/3) π [ f(plx) - (f(plx) - f’(plx) dplx) ) ]

Wait, that would be (4/3) π [ f’(plx) dplx ]

Because f(plx) is 1/plx^3, so f’(plx) = -3 plx^(-4).

So,

ΔV ≈ (4/3) π [ (-3) (1/plx^4) ) dplx ]

= (4/3) π (-3) (1/plx^4) dplx

= -4 π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But volume can't be negative, so take the absolute value, so ΔV ≈ 4 π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but wait: when plx increases, d decreases. So the volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of a shell at higher plx (lower d), which would be a smaller sphere. Wait, no, actually, higher plx means closer distance, so the shell at plx is a sphere of radius 1/plx, and plx + dplx would be a slightly larger plx, so radius 1/(plx + dplx) is slightly smaller. So the volume between plx and plx+dplx would be the volume of the sphere at plx minus the sphere at plx + dplx. So for small dplx, it's the volume element at plx. So perhaps the correct expression is:

ΔV = (4/3) π [ (1/plx)^3 - (1/(plx + dplx))^3 ]

≈ (4/3) π [ (1/plx^3) - (1/plx^3) (1 - 3 (dplx)/plx )) ]

= (4/3) π [ 1/plx^3 (3 dplx / plx) ) ]

= (4/3) π * (3 dplx / plx ) (1/plx^3 )

= (4 π dplx) / plx^4

So the number of stars in this volume element would be n * ΔV.

Thus, dN = n * 4 π (dplx) / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is 4 π n / plx^4.

Wait, that would imply that the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But wait, that's the same as earlier. So the correct answer would be A, 1/plx^4.

But wait, thinking again about the initial approach: when plx increases, the number of stars should decrease, because stars are at closer distances and so a unit change in plx corresponds to a larger number of stars. Or wait, no: if plx is small, meaning the stars are far away, then the number of stars in a given plx range might be fewer because the volume is larger.

Wait, but in a uniform distribution, the number of stars in a shell should depend on the volume. Let me think about volume in terms of d (distance). The volume of a shell at distance d is 4π d² dd. So for each unit of dd, the number of stars is proportional to d². But in terms of plx, since d is 1/plx, the volume would be proportional to (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/plx^2). Wait, that would be (1/plx^2) * (dplx/plx^2) )= dplx / plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hmm, that's consistent with both methods.

Wait, but this seems a bit counterintuitive. Because as plx increases, the number of stars per unit plx would go down as 1/plx^4. So, for example, near the Earth (large plx), the number of stars in a given plx range would be lower. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Let me think about it again.

Wait, no, because as plx increases (distance decreases), the number of stars in a thin plx shell would be higher, because the volume is smaller. Wait, but according to the math, it's 1/plx^4.

Hmm. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: in a uniform distribution, how does the number of stars per unit volume depend on distance. It doesn't; it's the same everywhere. So the number in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is n * 4π d² dd. So as d increases, the number of stars per shell increases because d² grows, but each shell is at a larger radius, so the volume increases more.

Wait, but when you look at it in terms of plx, which is 1/d, for d large, plx is small. So at a small plx (far away), the number of stars per unit plx is lower because each unit of plx corresponds to a larger shell with more volume. Hmm, but according to the calculation, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which would mean that as plx increases (d decreases), the number of stars per unit plx increases by plx^4. So for a plx of 1, the number per unit plx would be 1, but for plx of 0.5, it's 1/(0.5)^4 = 16 times higher. That seems correct because at closer distances, each unit of plx corresponds to a much smaller volume, so more stars in that range.

So, the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the correct answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning their number density is constant. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. 

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is given by \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dr \), where \( n \) is the number density of stars. To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \). This gives:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx})\right).
\]

Taking the absolute value to ensure positivity, the number of stars per unit change in parallax becomes:

\[
\frac{dN}{d(\text{plx})} = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). As parallax increases (i.e., as distance decreases), the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases rapidly due to the inverse fourth-power dependence.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
