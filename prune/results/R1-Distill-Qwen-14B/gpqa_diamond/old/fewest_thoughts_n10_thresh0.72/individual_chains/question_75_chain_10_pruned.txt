Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let me go through the problem step by step.

So the setup is that the researcher is trying to create a mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They added a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus of the coding sequence. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when testing, the protein isn't overexpressed. They looked at the plus strand of their construct and found this long DNA sequence.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which issue is causing the problem.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So that would mean that the HA tag might not be correctly added. If the HA tag is messed up, perhaps the protein isn't being recognized properly for purification. But wait, the issue is overexpression, not the ability to purify. So maybe not this one, unless the mutation affects the reading frame or the start codon.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would happen if there's a premature stop codon (like UAA, UAG, UGA) in the mRNA. So looking at the DNA sequence for the coding strand, any in-frame stop codons after the start would cause this. Let me check the DNA sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (Methionine). Let's look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets because those would be stop codons on the mRNA (since DNA is complementary, so for example, TAA in DNA would be AUG in mRNA, wait no, wait. Wait, DNA is in the plus strand as given. So the mRNA is made complementary to this strand. So mRNA would be A... complementary.

Wait, mRNA is synthesized as complementary to the DNA's template (minus) strand. So the given plus strand's sequence is the same as the mRNA except Tâ†’U.

So to find if there are any in-frame stop codons, I can scan the DNA sequence for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Because in the DNA, these would correspond to UAA, UAG, UGA in the mRNA, which are stop codons.

Looking at the sequence... Let me scan through. The sequence is quite long. Let's look for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking through the given sequence:
