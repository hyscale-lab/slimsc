Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, interplanar distance is important for things like X-ray diffraction. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, rhombohedral crystal... I think that's also called a trigonal crystal system. In such structures, all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. So, it's a special case where a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. That might simplify the calculations.

The interplanar distance formula for a crystal is given by the Bragg's equation, but wait, no, Bragg's law is for the angles of diffraction. I think the interplanar distance (d) is calculated using the formula d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (h²(1 - cos α) + k²(1 - cos β) + l²(1 - cos γ)) ) or something like that. Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe the formula I'm thinking of is from the Miller indices h, k, l.

Wait, another approach: For a cubic crystal, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But rhombohedral isn't cubic unless the angles are 90 degrees. So the formula must be adjusted for the angles.

I recall that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt[ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) ) ]

Wait no, maybe that's more for hexagonal systems. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is based on the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system, using the metric tensor.

Alternatively, the general formula for interplanar distance is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l²) + (k²/m²) + (l²/n²) + ... ), but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I
