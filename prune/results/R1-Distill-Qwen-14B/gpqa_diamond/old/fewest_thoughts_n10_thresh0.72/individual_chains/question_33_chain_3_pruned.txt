Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated. I need to find the exo product from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. The Diels-Alder is a pericyclic reaction between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring, usually bicyclic if the starting materials are cyclic. So in this case, one of the molecules must be the diene and the other the dienophile.

Wait, 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Thiophene is a five-membered aromatic ring with one sulfur. The substituents are on carbons 2 and 5. Furan-2,5-dione is another cyclic molecule, furan with two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So, furan-2,5-dione is a dienophile, I think. Because dienophiles are usually electron-deficient, like with electron-withdrawing groups. The dienophile would be the one that's electron-deficient, so the furan-2,5-dione with the two ketones is likely the dienophile.

So the diene must be the 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Wait, but thiophene is an aromatic compound. Can it act as a diene? Well, sometimes in Diels-Alder reactions, the diene can be non-conjugated but must be in a s-cis conformation. Thiophene has a conjugated system, but for Diels-Alder, the diene needs to be in a conjugated, s-cis form. So maybe here, the thiophene acts as the diene. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the Diels-Alder typically involves a conjugated diene and a dienophile.

Alternatively, maybe the furan-2,5-dione is the diene? No, I think furan has a conjugated diene system. Wait, furan is an electron-rich diene, but usually dienophiles are electron-deficient. So furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups which would make it electron-deficient, so it's the dienophile.

So the 2,5-dimethylthiophene must be the diene. But wait, thiophene is aromatic and planar; it might not be able to act as a diene. Unless it's part of a strained system or something. Alternatively, maybe the thiophene is the dienophile and the furan-2,5-dione is the diene. But furan is a good diene, so that makes more sense.

Wait, maybe I should think about their structures. Furan-2,5-dione is a five-membered ring with two
