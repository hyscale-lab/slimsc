Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. And N is the normalization constant sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, the non-Gaussianity measure here is the relative entropy between the state rho and a reference Gaussian state tau. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So this is the relative entropy between rho and tau.

I remember that for pure states, the von Neumann entropy S = -tr(rho ln rho). But here, it's the difference between the entropy of rho and tau. So, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). Oh wait, no, wait: del_b is the difference, so it's the relative entropy which is also known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between rho and tau.

But wait, the relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity I've heard before is sometimes called the "entanglement entropy" or something else. But in this case, the problem states it's using relative entropy measure. So I think for this problem, we just need to compute this expression.

First, I need to find the density matrix rho of the state |psi>. Since it's a pure state, rho is |psi><psi|. Then, the reference Gaussian state tau is, I think, the closest Gaussian state to rho. But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state here? Because the Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian, but the state itself is non-Gaussian.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the reference state. Maybe the reference is the completely mixed state? Or perhaps the Gaussian state that is closest in some sense to the given state. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that maximizes entropy for the same purity? Or maybe for the same parameters, like the same first and second moments. Hmm.

Wait, but in the case of a Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the state is non-Gaussian. The reference Gaussian state could be the thermal state with the same average photon number or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reference is the Gaussian state with the same density matrix as rho but without the non-Gaussian features.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is between the given state and a specific Gaussian state, like the squeezed vacuum state or something else. But I'm not sure. Maybe I can think about what the relative entropy would be in certain cases.

Let me think about the case where the state is Gaussian. Then, the relative entropy would be zero, right? Because rho would be equal to tau. So if the state is Gaussian, nG is zero. Looking at the options, option D is 0, which might be the case if the state is Gaussian. But wait, the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian. So maybe the nG is not zero. So D isn't the answer unless perhaps for some parameters it becomes Gaussian.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is non-Gaussian. So the state rho is non-Gaussian. So the relative entropy should be non-zero unless the state is already Gaussian, which it's not. So that suggests that the non-Gaussianity would be non-zero, so options B and C are possibilities, and A is 2.48 which is higher, and D is zero which I think is not the case.

But wait, perhaps in some cases the relative entropy could be zero. Wait, maybe if the state is already Gaussian, then the relative entropy is zero. So the question is, is the given state Gaussian?

Wait, coherent states are Gaussian, but a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian. So nG should be non-zero, so option D (0) is not correct.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: perhaps for some specific values of phi and alpha, the state becomes a Gaussian state. For example, if phi is zero, the state is just |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, if phi is pi/2, it's |-alpha>, which is Gaussian. But here, phi is -pi/4. So it's a superposition, so non-Gaussian.

So the nG should be non-zero, so D is not the answer.

Wait, but let's calculate. The relative
