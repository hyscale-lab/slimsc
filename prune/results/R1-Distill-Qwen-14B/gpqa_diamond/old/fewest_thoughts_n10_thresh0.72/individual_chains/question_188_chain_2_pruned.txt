Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So the question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles equal too, so that's a rhombohedral system. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and each angle alpha, beta, gamma is 30 degrees. Wait, but wait, the (111) plane's interplanar distance is what's being asked.

Right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 cos^2 α + k^2 cos^2 β + l^2 cos^2 γ) ) ), but wait, that might not be exactly right. Oh wait, I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + kl cos α + lh cos β) ) ), but wait no, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, wait, another approach. For a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But rhombohedral is a bit more complicated because the angles aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles α, β, γ is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + kl cos α + lh cos β) ) )

But in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, right? So α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So that might simplify things.

So, for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) - 2(1*1 cos 30° + 1*1 cos 30° + 1*1 cos 30°) )

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

The denominator inside the square root is:

(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = 3.

Then the term with cosines: 2*(1*1 cos30° + 1*1 cos30° + 1*1 cos30°) = 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2)) ) 

Wait, cos30° is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So 3 times sqrt(3)/2 is (3√3)/2. Multiply by 2: that's 3√3.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - (3√3)).

Wait, but wait a second, that would be 3 - 3√3, which is a negative number because √3 is about
