Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so both are moving in the same direction? So the relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c, because that's only for classical mechanics. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't add that way. I remember the formula for relative velocity uses the Lorentz factor.

The formula I think is v_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²). Oh wait, wait, u is the speed of one object as seen from the other's frame. Or is it the other way around? Let me get this straight. If astronaut A is moving at speed u in the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at v in the lab frame, then the speed of B as seen from A's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Right, because you subtract u from v and then divide by that factor.

So here, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. Since both are in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So that's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so E = gamma * m c². But wait, the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. So the energies would be E1 = gamma1 * 2m
