Okay, so I have this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Or wait, beta is 1/(kT), so the exponent is βE. Wait, wait, no, the standard formula is Z = sum_{states} exp(-β E). So I need to calculate all possible energy values each state can take and sum the exponentials multiplied by their degeneracy.

Each spin can be ±1, so for three spins, there are 2^3=8 possible states. But maybe some have the same energy, so I can group them.

Let me think about how the energy E is calculated. The energy is given by -J times the sum of the products of each pair. So S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. 

Wait, S_i can be +1 or -1. So S_i S_j = +1 if they are the same, -1 if different. So each term in the sum can be ±1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can range from -3 to +3, right? Because each term contributes +1 or -1.

But wait, no. Let me think: each S_i S_j can be 1 or -1. So the sum can be 3 (when all three terms are 1), 1 (two terms 1, one -1), -1 (one term 1, two -1), or -3 (all three terms -1). 

But wait, is that possible? Let me check some examples.

Take all spins up: S1=1, S2=1, S3=1. Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Another case: two up, one down. Let's say S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no. Wait, the sum is (-1) = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = 1-2 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Another case: one up, two down. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2= -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E = J again.

Wait, does that mean all cases with two up and one down, or two down and one up, have the same sum? Let's see another example: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E= J.

So in general, when the number of +1 terms in the sum is two and one, the sum is -1, which gives E= J. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 equals to (number of pairs that are same) minus (number of pairs that are different). Because each same pair contributes +1, each different contributes -1. So for three spins, there are three pairs.

So the sum can be:

- All three pairs same: sum is 3 → E = -3J.

- Two pairs same, one different → sum is (2*1) + (-1) = 1 → E = -J*(1) = -J.

Wait, but wait, this contradicts my earlier example. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's reevaluate. Let me think about how the number of same pairs affects the sum.

For three spins, each spin can be +1 or -1. Let me count for each possible state the number of pairs that are same.

Case 1: All three spins same. So all three pairs are same. Sum is 3 → E= -3J.

Case 2: Two spins same, one different. How many such states are there? For each spin, you can have it be the different one. So there are 3 possibilities.

In each such state, how many same pairs are there? Let's see: suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. The pairs S1S2=1 (same), S1S3=-1 (different), S2S3=-1 (different). So same pairs =1; different pairs=2.

So the sum is same*1 + different*(-1) = 1*(1) + 2*(-1) = 1-2 = -1 → E= J.

Wait, so for this case, sum is -1, E= J.

Case 3: All three spins are different. But wait, with three spins, each being ±1, can all be different? No, because you can't have three all different when each is either +1 or -1. So the only possibilities are all same, or two same and one different.

Wait, wait, another case: two are -1, one is +1. Then the same situation as case 2; the sum would be -1, E= J.

So the possible values of the sum (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) are 3 and -1.

Wait, but in another approach, maybe I can compute this using variables.

Alternatively, let me consider that for three spins, the sum can take certain values.

Wait, another approach: the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be written as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) all divided by 2. Because:

(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)

So, solving for the sum:

S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2.

Since each S_i can be ±1, S_i^2 is 1. So S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3.

So the sum becomes [ (S_total)^2 - 3 ] / 2.

S_total is S1 + S2 + S3. What are the possible values of S_total?

Each S can be +1 or -1. So S_total can be -3, -1, +1, +3.

So (S_total)^2 can be 9, 1, 1, 9 for those cases.

So for S_total =3, sum is (9-3)/2 = 3.

For S_total =1, sum is (1-3)/2 = -1.

For S_total=-1, same as 1: (1-3)/2= -1.

For S_total=-3: (9-3)/2=3.

So that confirms the sum can be 3 or -1.

So the possible energy values are:

E = -J * sum → if sum is 3 → E = -3J.

If sum is -1 → E = J.

Now, how many states correspond to each sum?

Case 1: sum is 3. That happens when all spins are same. There are 2 such states (all +1 or all -1).

Case 2: sum is -1. This occurs when there's a mix of spins, either two up and one down, or two down and one up. How many such states are there?

Each spin can be the one that's different. So for three spins, there are 3 possibilities where one spin is different. So 3 states for each of the two cases (like two up, one down, and two down, one up). So total of 3 * 2 = 6 states? Wait no, wait. No, because for three spins, each state where exactly one spin is different is 3 possibilities (each spin can be the different one). So for each of these, the number is 3, and each has the same sum of -1.

Wait, but no: let me count. For three spins, each of the three possible single flips (like S1 is different, etc.) gives a state where two are same and one different. So each such state contributes to the sum of -1. So how many states have sum -1? Let's see: 3 possible different spins (each gives a state), but for each of these, what's the sum.

Wait, for example:

State 1: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → sum is 1-1-1 = -1.

State 2: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1 → sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.

State 3: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Also, the states where all three are the same: two states (all +1, all -1). 

Wait, but what about the state where two are -1 and one is +1? For example, S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1=-1. So that's another state with sum -1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when two are same and one different, there are 3 states. But now I see that, for each possible number of same spins, I have 3 states. But wait, the number of states where exactly two are +1 and one is -1 is 3. Similarly, the number of states where exactly two are -1 and one is +1 is 3. So in total, 6 states where the sum is -1. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me count all possible states where the sum is -1. Each of the 3 spins can be the different one, either + or -, but wait, no, because if two are same and one different, the different can be either + or -, but that would lead to different sums.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, each of the three spins can be the different one. For each such possibility, you can have either S=+1 or S=-1 in that position. Wait, no. Because in each case, the majority is the same. Let me clarify.

If I have two spins up and one down. How many such states are there? The down can be at any of the three positions. So 3 possibilities. Similarly, two spins down and one up: another 3 possibilities. So total 6 states where the sum is -1.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I thought of two up and one down, the sum was -1. Similarly, for two down and one up, the sum is also -1. So all 6 states have sum=-1.

Wait, but earlier when I considered all three being same, that's two states. So in total, 8 states, with two having sum 3, and six having sum -1.

So each state contributes to the partition function as exp(β E), but E is based on the state's energy.

So for the two states where sum is 3, E = -3J. So each contributes exp(β*(-3J)) = exp(-3Jβ).

For the six states where sum is -1, E= J. Each contributes exp(β*(J)) = exp(Jβ).

So the partition function Z is:

Z = 2 * exp(-3Jβ) + 6 * exp(Jβ).

Wait, but let me make sure. So the partition function is the sum over all states of exp(-β E). Because E is the energy, which is -J times the sum. So E = -J (sum). So for sum=3, E=-3J. So the term is exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3Jβ). Wait, wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, wait a second. Earlier, I thought that the energy E is -J times the sum. So if the sum is 3, E = -3J. So the exponent in Z is exp(-β E) = exp(3Jβ). But in my earlier calculation, I wrote that as exp(-3Jβ), which would be wrong. So I need to correct that.

So let me recheck. 

If E = -J (sum), then:

For sum=3 → E = -3J → exp(-β E) = exp(3Jβ).

For sum=-1 → E = J → exp(-β E)= exp(-Jβ).

So earlier, I had the exponents wrong. So the correct Z is:

Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6e^(-Jβ).

Option A: Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^(Jβ).

So according to my corrected calculation, the Z is 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ), which is option B.

But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes, people get confused about the sign in the exponent.

The partition function is Z = sum_{n} g_n exp(-β E_n), where g_n is the degeneracy.

E_n is the energy of a state with sum s. So s = sum of S_i S_j. So E = -J s.

So for s=3, E = -3 J → the term is exp(3 J β).

For s=-1, E = J → term is exp(- J β).

So with 2 states for s=3 and 6 for s=-1, Z is 2 exp(3 J β) +6 exp(-J β), which is option B.

Wait, but let me think again about the number of states. Earlier, I thought that two states have sum=3, which is correct. But when I counted the number of states with sum=-1, I thought it's 6. But wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, each spin can be +1 or -1. For three spins, the number of states where the sum s= S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is 3: that's only two states, all +1 or all -1.

The other six states have s=-1. So yes, 6 states. So the calculation holds.

So the correct partition function is option B: Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Looking back at the options, option B is that.

So the answer should be option B.


To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \), and the partition function is defined as \( Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-\beta E} \), where \( \beta = \frac{1}{kT} \).

### Step 1: Possible Energy Values
The energy depends on the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). Each term \( S_iS_j \) can be \( +1 \) (if \( S_i = S_j \)) or \( -1 \) (if \( S_i \neq S_j \)). Thus, the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can take the following values:
- **Case 1**: All spins are the same (all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)), giving a sum of \( +3 \). This corresponds to \( E = -3J \).
- **Case 2**: Two spins are the same, and one is different, giving a sum of \( -1 \). This corresponds to \( E = J \).

### Step 2: Degeneracy of Each Energy Level
- For \( E = -3J \) (sum \( +3 \)): There are 2 states (all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)).
- For \( E = J \) (sum \( -1 \)): There are 6 states. These correspond to the cases where one spin is different from the other two, and there are 3 such configurations for each choice of the different spin (\( S_1, S_2, \) or \( S_3 \)).

### Step 3: Partition Function
The partition function is the sum over all states, weighted by \( e^{-\beta E} \). Using the degeneracies and energy values:
- For \( E = -3J \): Contribution is \( 2 \cdot e^{-\beta(-3J)} = 2 \cdot e^{3J\beta} \).
- For \( E = J \): Contribution is \( 6 \cdot e^{-\beta(J)} = 6 \cdot e^{-J\beta} \).

Thus, the partition function is:
\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect signs in exponents).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect coefficients and exponents).

### Final Answer
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
