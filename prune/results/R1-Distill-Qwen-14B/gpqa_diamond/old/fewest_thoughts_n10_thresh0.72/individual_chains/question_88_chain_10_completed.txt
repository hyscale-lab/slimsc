Okay, so I've got this question here about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins. Hmm. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The setup says that GFP is tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus. They delivered these to mice via oral gavage. Then, in vivo imaging showed some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid and some got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. But they were able to identify fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene, there was high variability.

The question is asking which process is taking place. The options are A to D.

So, first, I need to think about what each process is and where they happen.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. I remember that this process occurs in B cells during the immune response. It's a mechanism that introduces mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor (BCR), which increases the diversity of antibodies. This happens after the B cells have been activated, often in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. So when B cells proliferate and differentiate, they undergo this process.

Option B: Complement activation. That's part of the innate immune response. The complement system helps in opsonizing pathogens and causing lysis. But I don't see how this directly relates to the variability in the heavy chain gene sequences. Unless the rotavirus particles are being targeted by complement proteins, but the question is about the process in the isolated cells.

Option C: Class switching recombination. This is when B cells change the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG), which happens during the immune response once the B cells are activated. It involves recombination at the heavy chain locus. But this doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions, just the class.

Option D: VDJ recombination. This is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to form the heavy chain. This is a key step for generating diversity in the BCR. But this happens early in development, not necessarily during a response to an antigen delivered later in life.

So the experiment here is about an immune response to rotavirus delivered orally. The Peyer patches are involved, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. When the rotavirus capsid proteins are taken up, they're probably processed and presented to B cells, which then respond.

The GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins were delivered, and some made it to the Peyer patches. In the Peyer patches, the B cells would take up the antigen, process it, and present it on their surface as part of the BCR. Then, these B cells get activated, leading to proliferation and differentiation.

Now, when they look at the variable heavy chain genes in the proliferating cells, they see high variability. High variability suggests that the B cells are undergoing some process that changes the variable regions. That points me towards somatic hypermutation because that's when the variable regions are mutated to increase diversity.

VDJ recombination is during initial B cell development, so that's not it. Class switching is about changing the isotype, not the variable regions. Complement activation doesn't affect the B cell's variable gene sequences.

So the process is likely somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence imaging shows that some GFP-tagged proteins are destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus, but others reach the Peyer patches, where they are taken up by B cells. These B cells proliferate and their variable heavy chain genes are sequenced, revealing high variability. This variability suggests a process that modifies the variable regions of the heavy chain during the immune response.

**Option A: Somatic hypermutation**  
This process occurs in B cells during the immune response, introducing mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor to increase antibody diversity. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes and fits the context of an immune response to the rotavirus antigen in the Peyer patches.

**Option B: Complement activation**  
Complement activation is part of the innate immune response and involves opsonization or lysis of pathogens. However, it does not directly affect the variable heavy chain gene sequences, making this option unlikely.

**Option C: Class switching recombination**  
This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and involves recombination at the heavy chain locus. However, it does not introduce variability in the variable regions, which are already established.

**Option D: VDJ recombination**  
This process generates diversity during B cell development in the bone marrow by combining V, D, and J segments. However, it occurs early in development and does not explain the variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes during this experiment.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, a process that occurs during the immune response in activated B cells. 

Answer: A
