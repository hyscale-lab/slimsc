Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I'm supposed to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector from the given options.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when the system is measured. So, if P is the operator, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to +ħ/2, I need to find a vector that, when P acts on it, gives that scalar multiplied by the vector itself.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components: P_x, P_y, P_z. Oh, right! Because the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n would have components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ)? Or wait, wait, no. Wait, the x-z plane is where y=0. So the direction n would have components (x, 0, z). So that would mean n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the angle definitions here.

But perhaps I don't need to get into the direction vector details right now. Let's see. The operator P would be the sum of its components in the direction of n. So P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Oh, right! Because any vector operator can be expressed as the component in the direction of n times the corresponding Pauli matrices or something similar. Since P is a vector operator, its expectation value in a state would be the expectation value of each component multiplied by the direction vector. But for the operator itself, it's the sum of each component multiplied by the direction. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2
