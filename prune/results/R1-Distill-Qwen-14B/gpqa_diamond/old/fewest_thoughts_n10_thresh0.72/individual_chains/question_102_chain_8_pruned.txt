Okay, so I've got this question here about a scientific experiment, and I need to figure out what's going wrong. Let's try to break it down step by step.

So the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So the vector has two open reading frames. 

Looking at the vector setup: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. Oh wait, IRES is Internal Ribosome Entry Site, which allows for the translation of a downstream ORF without the need for a stop codon, right? So this setup should allow both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Now, the stops: between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, it's lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, for the ligand to be expressed, the Cre would need to excise the loxP sites. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP, Cre would act on lox2272 sites. Wait, but Cre recombinase typically acts on loxP sites. Lox2272 is a variant that Cre can also act on, I think. So, when Cre is present, it would remove the stop cassettes, allowing expression.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. The blot showed a signal proportional to actin, which is a loading control. So the proteins are being expressed. Then they made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice, which are hemizygous. After the offspring are born, they looked under a confocal microscope for fluorescence but didn't see any green signal. So the eGFP isn't lighting up.

What could be wrong here? The options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct has both ligand and receptor; if they're overexpressed, maybe they'd still work in the same cell? Not sure yet. Also, the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. This option doesn't directly address the expression issue, more about function.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the construct is stuck, then eGFP wouldn't be on the cell surface and wouldn't fluoresce. But the problem is that the vector's design is such that the stop cassette should be removed by Cre. If the stop is
