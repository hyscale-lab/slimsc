Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see... I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. The problem states that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another matrix.

The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y. Because Pauli matrices are 2x2, and sigma_y is exactly that. So, S is sigma_y, right?

So Ay is c * sigma_y. Since sigma_y is a Pauli matrix, it's Hermitian. Multiplying by a real constant c would keep it Hermitian, which makes sense because observables are Hermitian. So Ay is Hermitian, which means its eigenvalues should be real. Oh wait, but the problem is about the Y-component of angular momentum. The eigenvalues should be related to the spin. For an electron, which has spin-1/2, the eigenvalues of the angular momentum components are ± ħ/2. But wait, muons are also spin-1/2 particles, so same applies.

Wait, but c is h/(4π). Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. But wait, ħ is h/(2π), so ħ = h/(2π). So c here is (h)/(4π) = ħ/2. So c is ħ/2.

Wait, then Ay is (ħ/2) * sigma_y. So the eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1. So when multiplied by c, eigenvalues become (ħ/2) * (±1), which are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2. But let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, those can't be right because the eigenvalues of Ay should be real. So A is talking about complex eigenvalues, which can't be correct because Ay is Hermitian. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, no—eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts should be zero. So B is wrong because it's suggesting non-zero imaginary parts.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Well, for angular momentum, the commutators [Ay, Az] are non-zero. So the eigenfunctions of Ay and Az can't be the same. But A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components. So any eigenfunction of Ay would also be an eigenfunction of A². So C's first part is correct, but the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That seems correct because different components don't share eigenfunctions generally. So C might be a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Basis functions... Ay is a 2x2 matrix here. Its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So any vector can be expressed as a combination of these eigenvectors. Wait, but the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. I think that's correct because, in linear algebra, the eigenvectors of a diagonalizable matrix form a basis. So D seems correct as well.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about angular momentum, so what about the possible properties? Let me think again. The eigenfunctions of Ay are the eigenvectors, which are two in a 2x2 system. So they form a basis. So D is correct in that sense. So in the options, both C and D could be correct statements.

Wait, but I need to look at the question again. It says, during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement will you consider correct. So the options are statements about what is correct when calculating.

Wait, option C: the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is S·S, which for spin-1/2 particles is (ħ²)(S(S+1)) where S=1/2. So A² would have eigenvalue (3ħ²/4). So any eigenstate of Ay should also be an eigenstate of A² because [Ay, A²]=0. So the first part of C is correct. But the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Ay and Az do not commute, their eigenfunctions are not the same. So the second part of C is correct. So C is a correct statement.

Option D: It's saying that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, any 2
