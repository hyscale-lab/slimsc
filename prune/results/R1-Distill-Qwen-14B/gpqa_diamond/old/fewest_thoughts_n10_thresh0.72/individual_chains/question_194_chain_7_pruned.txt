Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

Each spin can be either +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy E for each state.

The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are the same or opposite.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way to do this without listing all 8 states. Let me think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each product S_i S_j is 1 if the spins are the same, -1 otherwise. So the sum can vary. Let's denote the sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H.

I need to find the possible values of H and how many states correspond to each H.

Possible H values: Let's see. For each pair, the product is either 1 or -1. So the sum can range from:

If all three products are 1, H=3.

If two products are 1 and one is -1, H=1.

If one product is 1 and two are -1, H=-1.

If all three are -1, H=-3.

Wait, but can H actually take all these values? Let me see.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. For three spins, how does the sum H turn out?

Alternatively, perhaps H can only be 3, 1, -1, -3?

Wait, let's test some cases.

Case 1: All spins up: S1=S2=S3=+1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So H=3.

Case 2: Two up, one down. Let's say S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So H=1-1-1 = -1.

Wait, that's H=-1. Hmm, but let me check another arrangement.

Case 3: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.

Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. So H=-1 +1 -1 = -1.

Another arrangement: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. So H=-1 -1 +1 = -1.

Wait, so in all cases where two spins are up and one down, H is -1?

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Let me count all possible H values.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of all same spins. When all are same, H=3. When two are same and one different, H=1? Or maybe not. Let me recalculate.

Wait, let's take another approach. The sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me note that (S
