Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift is periodic, and the amount of shift relates to the planet's mass and orbital period. Wait, but how exactly?

So Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's. So, the ratio P2/P1 is what we need.

I remember that the RV method's measured velocity (v) is related to the mass of the planet and the star's mass. The formula I think is something like v = (G * (M_planet) / (M_star + M_planet))^(1/3) * (1 / (1 AU)) * (P/(2Ï€)) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing some terms. Oh, right, another approach: the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is given by K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something). Wait, maybe it's better to think about the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude.

Oh right! The formula I think is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/ something) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_*)) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ). Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me look it up in my notes.

Ah yes, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1 / (P * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, perhaps the exact formula is K = [ (27
