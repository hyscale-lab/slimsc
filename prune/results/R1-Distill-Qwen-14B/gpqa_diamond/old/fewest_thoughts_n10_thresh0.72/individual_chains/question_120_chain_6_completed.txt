Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, it says to assume the stars are uniformly distributed. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power terms of 1/plx. I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance. But wait, no, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if a star is 1 parsec away, its parallax is 1 arcsecond. If it's 2 parsecs, then 0.5 arcseconds, and so on.

But the question is about the number of stars in a given range of parallax. If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that the number of stars is uniform per unit volume of space. Oh, right! So number density is constant. So n(r) is the same everywhere.

Wait, parallax relates to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars. So if I think about a thin shell at a certain distance d, the volume of that shell would be... Oh, wait, volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr. So for a given distance r, the volume element is proportional to r². But wait, since parallax plx = 1/r, r = 1/plx. So substituting, dr would be derivative of 1/plx. Let me think, plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx. So dr = -d(1/plx) = (1/plx²) d(plx). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of stars in a range of plx.

So the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax p and p + dp would be the number density multiplied by the volume of that shell. The volume of the shell is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/(p^2)) dp. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The shell between p and p + dp corresponds to a distance r = 1/p and r + dr = 1/(p - dp) or something. Wait, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of p.

Wait, the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. So if a star is at a distance r, the volume element (the shell) is 4π r² dr. But r = 1/p, so plugging that in, the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 dr. But dr is in terms of r. Oh wait, since p = 1/r, then dr = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, dr = -1/p² dp. So the volume becomes 4π (1/p^2) * ( -1/p² dp ). Wait, but that would be 4π (1/p^4) (-dp). Hmm, but the minus sign just indicates direction; in terms of magnitude, it's 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, wait no, I think I messed that up. Let me think again. The volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. Since r = 1/p, then r² = 1/p². So 4π (1/p²) dr. But dr is in terms of r. Since p = 1/r, dr = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting that into the volume, the shell's volume is 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² dp) ) → 4π (-1/p^4) dp. But since we're considering dp positive (a small increment in p), the negative indicates that as p increases, r decreases, but the magnitude is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in that shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume. So number of stars dN = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit range of p (dp) would be proportional to 1/p^4. So per unit p, the number decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So that's dN/dp. So dN/dp = 4 π n (1/p^4). So the number of stars per unit plx interval (like between p and p+dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, the options are A) ~1/plx^4, B)1/p^2, etc. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the substitution. Let me redo the steps more carefully.

Given that stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is a constant. The distance r is related to parallax p by r = 1/p parsecs.

The volume of a shell at radius r with thickness dr is 4π r² dr.

Expressed in terms of p, dr = (dr/dp) dp. Since p = 1/r, dp = -1/r² dr → dr = - r² dp. But r =1/p, so dr = -(1/p²) dp.

So substituting back into the volume:

4π r² dr = 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² dp ) = -4π (1/p^4) dp.

The negative sign indicates that as p increases, r decreases. But for the number of stars, we take the magnitude.

So the volume is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Number of stars in this shell (dN) = n * Volume = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dp) is dN/dp = 4 π n (1/p^4).

So the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( r \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{r} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars \( n \) is constant. 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell and the number density \( n \). The volume of the shell is given by \( 4\pi r^2 dr \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{p} \), the volume becomes \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) dr \). To express \( dr \) in terms of \( dp \), we use \( p = \frac{1}{r} \), which gives \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting this into the volume, the magnitude of the volume becomes \( 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp \).

The number of stars in this shell is then \( dN = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp \). The number of stars per unit range of \( p \) (i.e., \( \frac{dN}{dp} \)) is therefore proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \), corresponding to option **A**.
