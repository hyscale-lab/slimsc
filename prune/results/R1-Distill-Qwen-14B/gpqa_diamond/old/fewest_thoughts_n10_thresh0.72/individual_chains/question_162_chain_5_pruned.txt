Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So, I'm dealing with a 2D spacetime maybe? Or perhaps a spatial slice in some higher-dimensional space.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is like a surface with constant negative curvature. I remember that the metric for a pseudosphere looks similar to the hyperbolic space metric. But the standard hyperbolic metric usually has terms like (dx² + dy²)/(1 + (x² + y²)/a²), something like that. Hmm, but this metric is scaled by 32/(4 - (x² + y²)).

So the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Wait, so 4 is like r squared, maybe? Because if r=2, then 4 is r². So the metric has a denominator that depends on x² + y², which I'll call ρ², where ρ is the radial coordinate in the x-y plane.

Wait, but the metric is (32)/(4 - ρ²) (dρ² + (ρ² dθ²)) or something like that? Wait, no, the original metric is in dx² + dy², which could be expressed in polar coordinates as dr² + r² dθ². So, yeah, maybe ρ is the radial coordinate here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to switch to polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

So substituting, the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm. So this looks like a metric for a 2D surface. The area element would be the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dr dθ. Wait, but the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the coefficients.

So the area element dA is sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ. So g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is (32 r²)/(4 - r²). So the product is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2. So the square root is (32 r)/(4 - r²). So dA = (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Wait, but wait a minute. The area would be the integral over r and θ. So the integral for the area would be ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to some maximum value) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

But wait, the denominator is 4 - r², which is (2 - r)(2 + r). So when
