Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass. The question gives me two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods; system_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. So the period for system_1 is twice that of system_2.

The problem also gives radial velocity (RV) amplitudes for each system. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Oh wait, I think the mass of a binary system depends on the masses of the two stars. But how does radial velocity come into play here?

I remember that in binary systems, the more massive star is closer to the center of mass. The radial velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. Because the more massive star moves slower. So, each star's velocity is related to the other's mass. The formula I think is something like V1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * (something with the orbit period and the gravitational constant). Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = [ (2Ï€ G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ) ] where i is the inclination angle, which I think is 90 degrees for an eclipsing system because they eclipse each other. So sin i is 1.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up some formulas, but the key point is that the velocity amplitude of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. So if star A has velocity K1, and star B has K2, then M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2 (since the center of mass requires M1*r1 = M2*r2, and velocities are inversely proportional to radius). So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So for system_1: star 1 has K1=10,
