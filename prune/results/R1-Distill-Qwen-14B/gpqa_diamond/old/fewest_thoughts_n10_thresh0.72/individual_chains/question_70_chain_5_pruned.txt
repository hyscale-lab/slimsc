Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see if I can piece everything together.

The question is about some reactions and the molecular symmetry of a product E. The options are symmetry groups, which I remember are related to the point groups in molecular symmetry. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. Let me break down the problem.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak one. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I need to figure out what E is, and then determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me think about each reaction step by step.

Starting with A + 8 B → C (bright red). The fact that it's a solid reacting with gas suggests perhaps a metal reacting with something. The 8 equivalents imply a stoichiometric ratio, maybe 1 A : 8 B. Bright red product—could that be something like Cu or another transition metal compound?

Wait, another point: when C reacts with water, it forms A again plus two acids. F is strong, G is weak. Common strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak ones are like H3PO4, H2CO3, etc.

So, if C reacts with water to produce A and two acids, perhaps C is a metal oxide or a sulfide? Or maybe a nitride or something else.

Wait, another reaction: D and B in 1:1 ratio form H, which is a solvent. Solvents could be something like H2O, ethanol, maybe something else. But D and B reaction—maybe they're gases reacting to form a solvent. So for example, if B is O2 and D is H2, they form H2O as solvent. Or if B is something else...

Wait, but let me think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like a nerve agent, or maybe a highly toxic gas or compound. Alternatively, it could be a compound like phosgene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps something like NO or another oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas; maybe something like chlorine gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound like diphosgene or something else. Or perhaps E is something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but that's a thought.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider possible candidates for C. Since C is a bright red solid, what compounds are bright red? Copper(II) oxide is black, not red. Maybe lead dioxide is dark brown. Maybe it's a different kind of compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitrate. If A is a metal, and B is something like O2 or another oxidizing agent. Wait, but 8 equivalents of B... Hmm.
