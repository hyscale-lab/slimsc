Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The problem says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H stretching. A peak at 3000 cm^-1 is likely an -OH group because that's where alcohols or carboxylic acids show up. Wait, but waitâ€”alcohol O-H is usually broader and maybe around 3300? Or maybe it's a broad peak because it's an alcohol, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Also, the problem mentions peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a ketone or aldehyde. 1650 might be conjugated carbonyl, like in a carbonyl with a double bond nearby, maybe an ester or a conjugated ketone? Alternatively, 1650 could be an amide, but wait, the options don't have nitrogen, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: 1700 is probably a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe a conjugated system. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and another is an aromatic ring's C=C stretch? Wait, aromatic rings usually have C=C around 1450-1600, but 1650 is a bit higher. Could it be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone?

So, FTIR suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (from 1700 and 1650) and possibly an O-H group (the broad peak at 300
