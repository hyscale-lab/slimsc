Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my interplanar distances. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says we're dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal, but the angles between them might not be 90 degrees. Oh wait, in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral system with interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The (111) plane's interplanar distance is what we're after.

I think the formula for the interplanar distance d in a crystal structure is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices. But wait, the formula might be more complicated than that, especially because this isn't a cubic system but a rhombohedral one. Oh right, in a cubic system, the formula is d(hkl) = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral isn't cubic. So I need the more general formula.

I recall that for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is calculated using the metric tensor. The formula involves the reciprocal of the square root of (h² + k² + l²) multiplied by some factor that depends on the angles in the crystal.

Wait, the formula for inter
