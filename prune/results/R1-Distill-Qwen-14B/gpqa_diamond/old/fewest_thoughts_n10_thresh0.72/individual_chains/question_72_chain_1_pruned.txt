Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it goes through several reactions, and we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product, product 4. The options are A to D, with numbers 8, 4, 10, 7.

Hmm. So, I think I need to figure out the structure of each product after each reaction step. Let's break it down.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornene structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. The tert-butoxy group is O(C(CH3)3), so that's a bulky substituent.

Step 1: This compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1.

Wait, sodium iodide with dibromomethyl groups. I think this is some kind of elimination or substitution. Oh wait, when you have a dihalide and you have a base like sodium iodide, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or a coupling reaction.

But wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexadiene has two substituents, each being a dibromomethyl group. So positions 5 and 6 have -CH2Br2 groups. Hmm, wait, no, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2. So each substituent is a methylene group with two bromines. So 5 and 6 positions each have CH2Br2.

Wait, but combining this with the starting compound. The starting material is a norbornene derivative. So maybe a Diels-Alder reaction? Because nor
