Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, but wait—each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, perhaps we should consider the uncertainty in the energy of each state to determine if they can be distinguished.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference (E2 - E1) between the two states. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty from the lifetimes might make it hard to tell them apart.

So, let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1 with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and similarly for ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference should be significantly larger than the uncertainties in each state so that they can be resolved.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and then ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum or something. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy measurement would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in each state's energy, so that the two states don't overlap in their energy ranges.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the energy of each state. That is, the energy difference (ΔE) between E2 and E1 must be greater than or equal to the maximum uncertainty between them. Hmm, but how?

Wait, another approach: the energy resolution in experiments is often characterized by the energy uncertainty. If the energy difference between two states is much larger than the uncertainty, then they can be resolved. So the minimal detectable energy difference is determined by the uncertainty. So the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty.

Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. So to resolve E2 and E1, their energy difference should be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But we're dealing with eV here, so I should probably convert to eV. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules.

Wait, so ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To get ħ in units of eV·s, we can divide by the conversion factor: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So ħ ≈ (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) = approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately ħ / τ.

For E1, τ1 is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 6.582e-7 eV, which is 0.6582e-6 eV or 0.6582 micro-eV. Hmm, but wait, that's a pretty small number. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, wait, no, wait: 1e-9 s is 1 nanosecond. So ΔE1 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV. Which is about 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainties are 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for the two states.

But wait, the energy difference between E2 and E1 is ΔE = E2 - E1. To clearly distinguish them, this ΔE should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Or perhaps larger than the individual uncertainties. Hmm, I'm not sure.

But wait, when you have two states, the uncertainty in each state's energy is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So the overall uncertainty in their energy difference would be sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2), because when you subtract two independent uncertainties, you add their variances.

Wait, but let's think about it. If you have two measurements, each with their own uncertainties, the uncertainty in their difference would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties. So Δ(ΔE) = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ).

But wait, alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties, then it's more likely to be resolvable.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than the sum, then each state's energy range doesn't overlap with the other.

Wait, let me think: The first state has an energy E1 with uncertainty ΔE1, so its energy is somewhere in [E1 - ΔE1, E1 + ΔE1]. The second state E2 has [E2 - ΔE2, E2 + ΔE2]. The energy difference is E2 - E1. For the two to be distinguishable, the lower bound of E2 should be higher than the upper bound of E1. So E2 - ΔE2 > E1 + ΔE1. So, E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. That makes sense because if the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties, there's no overlap between the two ranges.

So, in this problem, the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

We have ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV (from τ1=1e-9 s) and ΔE2≈6.58e-8 eV (from τ2=1e-8 s). So the sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → way smaller than 7e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 eV. Which is much larger than 7e-7 eV.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00001e-6 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7.

So the only option that's larger than 7e-7 eV is option C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, wait a second. Because 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. 7e-7 is 0.0000007 eV. 0.0001 is much bigger. So yes, option C is way larger than the required sum of uncertainties.

So the correct option would be C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait—another thought. I'm a bit confused because the lifetimes are different. We're considering the energy difference between the two states. So perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is based on the minimum of the two lifetimes or something else? Hmm, I'm not sure. But according to the earlier reasoning, the sum of the uncertainties is about 7e-7 eV, and the only option that's bigger is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the uncertainties. Let me double-check the calculations.

Calculating ΔE for each state:

ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

Given ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.

For τ2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So sum is 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So yes, the answer would be option C.

But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes in experiments, the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty of the measurement, which might be based on the longer lifetime. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimum energy difference that can be resolved based on the combined lifetimes.

Wait, another thought: the energy difference must be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference. The uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE between the two states would be the quadrature sum of the uncertainties in each energy. Because when you subtract two quantities, their uncertainties add in quadrature.

So, Δ(ΔE) = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )

So ΔE must be greater than this value to be resolvable.

Let's compute that:

ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV → (6.58e-7)^2 = approx 4.33e-13.

ΔE2 = 6.58e-8 eV → (6.58e-8)^2 = approx 4.33e-15.

So sum is 4.33e-13 + 4.33e-15 ≈ 4.3733e-13.

√(4.3733e-13) ≈ 6.613e-7 eV.

So ΔE must be larger than 6.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
The reduced Planck's constant is approximately \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). Using this, we calculate the energy uncertainties for the two states:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the combined uncertainty in their energy difference. The uncertainty in the energy difference is the quadrature sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta (\Delta E) = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]

Substituting the values of \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \):

\[
\Delta (\Delta E) = \sqrt{(6.582 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (6.582 \times 10^{-8})^2}.
\]

\[
\Delta (\Delta E) = \sqrt{4.33 \times 10^{-13} + 4.33 \times 10^{-15}} \approx \sqrt{4.3733 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 6.613 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 6.613 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) to ensure the two states can be resolved.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
The energy difference required must be larger than \( 6.613 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Comparing this to the given options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 6.613 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is too small.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is also too small.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 6.613 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 6.613 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is too small.

### Final Answer:
The only option that satisfies the condition is **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.

Answer: C
