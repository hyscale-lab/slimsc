Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their host stars. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

So, the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which I remember tells us about their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars are interesting too: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up same size. So, same radius, different masses.

The researchers want to choose which planet has a higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. So I need to figure out which one has a higher transit probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. The formula for transit probability is something like R_star / a_planet, where R_star is the radius of the star and a_planet is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, isn't it more precise? Oh right, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a)², but wait no, maybe it's just (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, another approach is to consider that the probability is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but in a certain way. Let me get this right.

Wait, the transit probability is given by (R_star / a)² multiplied by (some factor depending on the inclination). But more accurately, the chance that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star is proportional to R_star/(a). Or is it (R_star + R_planet)/a? Oh, but since planets are much smaller than stars, R_planet is negligible. So the main factor is R_star divided by the semi-major axis (a).

Wait, no, the formula I recall is that the probability P is approximately (R_star / a)² multiplied by (1 + (R_planet / R_star)²)^{1/
