Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine, and we're supposed to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are given as A to D. 

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring determine where the substitution occurs. Substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions (ortho, meta, para).

Wait, right, activating groups are electron-donating, which make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups are electron-withdrawing and typically direct to meta positions, making the ring less reactive overall.

So for each substituent, I need to determine their activating or deactivating nature and their directing effects. Then, based on that, figure out how much para product each would form.

Let me list the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's an ester group, specifically ethoxycarbonyl. The carbonyl is a deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group. So the ester group is a meta director.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is a substituent. It's a deactivating (electron-withdrawing by inductive effect) but ortho/para-directing because of the lone pairs on Cl. Wait, no, wait. Chlorine is a halogen. Halogens are deactivating (they have a stronger -I effect than the +R effect) but are ortho/para directors because the lone pairs can donate electrons through resonance. So Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group. That's a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So substitution occurs mainly in the meta positions.

5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethyl group. Similar to methyl; it's an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group. That's deactivating, meta-directing. Because the -COOH is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so it deactivates the ring and directs meta.

So now, the para product formation depends on how much the substituent directs to para. Also, steric effects might play a role, but maybe that's not the main factor here.

Wait, but wait! For some substituents, the para position might not be as favored if the substituent is bulky. For example, in toluene (methyl benzene), the para product is major because the methyl group directs there and the steric hindrance isn't too bad. But in larger groups, maybe the ortho position is less favored, but para is still more than
