Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoing a Cope rearrangement. I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another diene structure, typically leading to a bicyclic or polycyclic compound. But wait, isn't the Cope specific to 1,5-dienes? So I need to check if the given molecule fits that.

The starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me draw that structure mentally. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings, right? One bridge is two carbons, another is two, and the third is one. So, the structure is like norbornene. Now, the substituents: it's 2-vinyl and 2-azabicyclo... Hmm, so the nitrogen is at position 2, and there's a vinyl group also at position 2. Oh wait, noâ€”the formula is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo, which would mean the nitrogen is at position 2 and the vinyl is also at position 2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the numbering: in bicyclo systems, the numbering starts from a bridgehead. So the structure has the nitrogen at position 2, and the vinyl group as a substituent at position 2.

Wait, but how does that set up for a Cope rearrangement? The Cope needs a conjugated diene with the right substituents. Let me think: the structure is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the double bond is at position 5. And there's a vinyl group (ethenyl) attached at position 2. So let me sketch that.

The bicyclo structure: imagine norbornene but with a nitrogen. So in norbornene, the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6, perhaps. So if the molecule is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6, and the nitrogen is at carbon 2.

Wait, the structure: I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three bridges: two bridges of two carbons and one bridge of one carbon. The substituents are attached at position 2.
