Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's see what it's about.

Okay, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, which I remember is standard for a lot of these calculations. The question gives the Ka values for H3PO4, which are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. 

Hmm, I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Or wait, sometimes people refer to PO4^3- as orthophosphate. Oh wait, no, the ortho is the HPO4^2- form. Let me think. Yeah, in the context of phosphate buffer systems, the HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- (which is the dihydrogen phosphate) and the conjugate acid of PO4^3-.

So the solution has two phosphate salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. My initial thought is that this is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. But wait, what's the exact situation here? Let me think about the dissociation steps.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps:

1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, in the solution, we have KH2PO4 (which is K+ and H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which is Na+ and HPO4^2- with some water of crystallization, but I guess the actual ions in solution are Na+ and HPO4^2-). 

So the solution is a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That means it's a buffer system between H2PO4^- (the weak acid) and HPO4^2- (its conjugate base). So the pH of the solution will be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using Ka2, since that's the step between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? Or is it PO4^3-? No, wait,
