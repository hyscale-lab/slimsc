Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking, at what energy do high-energy gamma-rays have their lifetimes limited by annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average CMB photon energy is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are from around 1e4 GeV up to 3.9e5 GeV. Wow, those are some high energies!

I remember that when a high-energy gamma-ray interacts with a low-energy photon, like from the CMB, they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. This process is called photon-photon annihilation. The reaction is γ + γ → e+ + e-. But for this to happen, the energy has to be sufficient. There's some threshold condition here.

So, the key here is the threshold energy. I think for pair production, the center-of-mass energy needs to be at least twice the electron mass. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so twice that is around 1.022 MeV. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, that's the threshold energy for a photon hitting a nucleus or something, but in this case, it's two photons annihilating. So I might be mixing something up.

Wait, no. The basic idea is that the combined energy of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame should be enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. So the center-of-mass energy squared should be at least (2m_e c²)^2. So the threshold condition is when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to 2m_e c².

But let's get into the math. The energy of each photon in the lab frame is E1 and E2. Since one photon is high energy (gamma-ray) and the other is low energy (CMB), which is around 1e-3 eV. Let me denote Eγ as the gamma-ray's energy and E_photon as the CMB photon's energy. So E_photon = 1e-3 eV.

The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (Eγ + E_photon)^2 - (pγ c + p_photon c)^2. But since photons are massless, their energy is |p|c. So p_photon = E_photon/(c), and pγ = Eγ/(c). So the expression becomes:

s = (Eγ + E_photon)^2 - ( (Eγ/(c)) c + (E_photon/(c)) c )^2
= (Eγ + E_photon)^2 - (Eγ + E_photon)^2

Wait, that can't be right because that would make s = 0. That suggests I'm missing something here. Oh wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, because when the two photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. So I should perhaps consider their directions.

Ah, right. Let me model this correctly. Let's say the gamma-ray is moving in the +x direction with energy Eγ,
