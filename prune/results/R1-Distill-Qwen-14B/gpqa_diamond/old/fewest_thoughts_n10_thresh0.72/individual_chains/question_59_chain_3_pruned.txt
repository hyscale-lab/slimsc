Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's see... The problem states that I have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps to calculate the pH after mixing.

Wait, right, the first thing I should do is figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in each solution because they will react. Let's break it down step by step.

CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. It doesn't completely dissociate, but for the purpose of neutralization, I think I can calculate the moles it contributes. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, providing H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it dissociates completely, giving OH- ions.

So, calculating moles for each:

For CH3COOH: Volume is 0.5 L, concentration 0.1 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 mol. Since it's a weak acid, each mole gives about 0.1 moles of H+ (because it's a monoprotic acid?), but wait, in solution, the H+ comes from its dissociation. But for neutralization, maybe I can just consider it contributing 0.05 mol of H+ (since each CH3COOH gives one H+ when it dissociates, but not completely). Hmm, but wait, in the presence of excess strong acid, maybe I can combine all the H+ contributions.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate total H+ from all acids and total OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes less H+. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and each formula unit gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. So for Ba(OH)2, moles are 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. Each gives two OH-, so total OH- is 0.18 mol.

Wait, but wait: the HCl and CH3COOH are acids, so they contribute H+; the Ba(OH)2 contributes OH-.

So, let's compute the total H+ from the acids and the total OH- from the base.

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol HCl → 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 mol CH3COOH → since it's weak, it doesn't fully dissociate, but for the purpose of neutralization, I think we can consider the available H+ as equal to the moles of CH3COOH because in solution, it can donate a proton. But wait, no, actually, the H+ from CH3COOH is less than 0.05 because it's a weak acid. Hmm, but when mixing with a strong base, the OH- will first neutralize the strong acid (HCl), then any weak acid (CH3COOH), and then any excess OH- will determine the pH. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate how much H+ and OH- are present.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Equivalents for H+:

HCl: 0.08 mol * 1 = 0.08 eq
