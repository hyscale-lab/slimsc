Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the process where they annihilate with a CMB photon to produce electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, which is a billion electron volts. That's a high energy!

So, I remember that when a high-energy gamma-ray interacts with a low-energy photon, like a CMB photon, they can annihilate into pairs. The threshold energy for this process is important because below that, the process can't happen. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the process is possible when the combined energy is enough to create the electron-positron pair. So the gamma-ray needs to have enough energy to meet the threshold when colliding with the CMB photon.

Electrons and positrons have a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV each, so together that's 1.022 MeV. But wait, wait, no. The rest mass energy is 0.511 MeV per particle. So for an electron-positron pair, it's 2*0.511 = 1.022 MeV. So the center-of-mass energy must be at least this.

But wait, in the lab frame, the CMB photon is moving, but the gamma is moving as well. So the reaction is gamma + photon → e+ e-. The threshold occurs when the combined energy is sufficient to produce the rest mass of the pair.

I think the formula for the threshold energy involves the product of the gamma-ray energy and the photon energy. Because in the center-of-mass frame, the energy must be at least the sum of the rest masses. So maybe the product of their energies should be equal to (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, the formula I remember is that for two particles colliding, the threshold condition is when the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is equal to twice the rest mass energy. Or maybe it's when their invariant mass equals twice the rest mass. Hmm.

Wait, the invariant mass squared (s) is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. For two photons, since they're massless, their energies are E = pc. So for two photons, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 (since (p1 + p2)c = (E1 + E2) because each photon's p=E/c). Wait, that would make s=0, which isn't right. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Alternatively, the invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. Since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta would subtract. Wait, let me think: Each photon's momentum is in opposite directions. So for two photons colliding, the total momentum is (p1 - p2) if they're moving towards each other.

But maybe a better approach is to consider the threshold condition. The minimum energy required is when the two photons (gamma and CMB photon) combine to just produce an electron-positron pair at rest. So, the center-of-mass energy should be at least 2 m_e c^2.

So, the condition is that sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c^2, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. So, s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_photon c)^2. Wait, but for photons, E = p c. So let's say E_gamma is the gamma's energy, E_photon is the CMB photon's energy.

But wait, the photons are moving in opposite directions. So their momenta are opposite. So, when they collide, the total momentum is (p_gamma - p_photon), because p_photon is in the opposite direction.

Wait, no, let me correct that. If the two photons are approaching each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. So, their total momentum is p_gamma - p_photon (since p_photon is in the opposite direction, it's negative). So, (p_gamma - p_photon) = (E_gamma/(c)) - (E_photon/(c)), but wait, that's if they're moving along the same line. But if one is moving in the opposite direction, their momentum vectors are opposite.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of four-momentum vectors. The sum of the four-momenta of the two photons must have an invariant mass squared equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So, the invariant mass squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons have E = |p| c, and their momenta are vectors.

So, if the two photons are moving in the same direction, then their momenta add up, but that's not the case for CMB photons which are isotropic. Wait, no, the CMB photon is in all directions, but for a given gamma-ray photon, the CMB photon is moving in some direction. To find the threshold, we can consider the situation where the gamma and CMB photon are moving towards each other, so their momenta are opposite, which would give the maximum possible invariant mass. Because that's when the sum of their energies is highest, and their momenta subtract.

So, in the scenario where the photons are moving directly towards each other, the momentum vectors are opposite. So, p_photon = E_photon/(c), and p_gamma = E_gamma/(c). So, the sum of the momenta is (p_gamma - p_photon) (since they're in opposite directions).

So, the invariant mass squared s is:

s = (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - [ (E_gamma/(c) - E_photon/(c)) c ]^2.

Simplify that:

= (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (E_gamma - E_photon)^2.

Expanding both squares:

= [ E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_photon + E_photon^2 ] - [ E_gamma^2 - 2 E_gamma E_photon + E_photon^2 ]

= E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_photon + E_photon^2 - E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_photon - E_photon^2

= (2 E_gamma E_photon + 2 E_gamma E_photon)

= 4 E_gamma E_photon.

So s = 4 E_gamma E_photon c^2? Wait, no, because all energies are in terms of E, but in the equation, we have E in terms of energy, and I think the invariant mass squared is in (energy)^2 units.

Wait, no, let me clarify the units. E is in energy units (like eV), c is in m/s, but in the equation, the four-momentum's space components are multiplied by c. So when I compute (p c), for a photon, E = p c → p = E/(c). So, in the four-momentum expression, the spatial part is (p_x, p_y, p_z), and each component is in kg m/s. But when multiplied by c, which is m/s, you get E in J. So, the invariant mass squared
