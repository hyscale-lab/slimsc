Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all involving carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. 

First, let me look at the given data. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups because the hydrogen bonds in alcohols or carboxylic acids cause such broadening. So that's probably an -OH group or maybe an -COOH. 

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb around 1700 cm^-1. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic C=O or perhaps something else. Alternatively, it could be an amide or conjugated carbonyl. But wait, the options don't have nitrogen, so maybe another carbonyl group. 

Wait, 1700 is more typical for a ketone or aldehyde, while 1650 might be an ester or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Alternatively, another carbonyl nearby. Also, I've heard that esters have carbonyl peaks around 1730â€“1750 cm^-1, but sometimes they can be lower depending on the substituents. So maybe the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like in a conjugated carbonyl system) or maybe an amide, but since there's no N in the options, probably not. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an acid.

Wait, but wait, if there's a broad peak at 3000, which is for O-H, like in a carboxylic acid. Then the 1700 could be a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have O-H (broad) and a strong C=O around 1700. Then the 1650 is what? Maybe another C=O from something else, or
