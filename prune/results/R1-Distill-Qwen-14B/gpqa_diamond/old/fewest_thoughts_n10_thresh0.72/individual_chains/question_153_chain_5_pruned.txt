Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? So it's a conjugate addition, adding to the beta carbon. 

The question gives three different reactions, and I need to find the products for each. Then, match them with the options A, B, C, etc.

Let me take each part one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. 

Wait, what's the structure of these compounds? Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH- something. Oh wait, no, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. It's a good nucleophile because it's a strong base. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Structure-wise, that would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, E configuration. So the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides.

In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile (like the enolate of dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the acrylate has the structure CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or is it CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached differently? Hmm, maybe I should think it through.

Wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, wait. The substituents on the acrylate: the formula is CH2=CH-C-O-... Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Or is the p-tol
