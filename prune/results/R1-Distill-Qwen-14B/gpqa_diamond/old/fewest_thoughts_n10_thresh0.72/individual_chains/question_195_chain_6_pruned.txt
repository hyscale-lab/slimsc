Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

So, the setup is that there's a planet with Earth's radius (1 Earth radius) orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The planet has an orbital period of 3 days. Now, they're asking about a second planet with 2.5 Earth radii. The question is about the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm, I think I remember that for a planet to transit its star, the orbital plane must be aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. But for occultation (when the planet is behind the star, causing a dip in the star's light), the planet must be larger or closer than the star? Or wait, occultation is when the planet is hidden by the star, so the star must block the planet. So the planet must be inside the star's disk from our perspective. So, the planet's orbital radius must be smaller than the star's radius as seen from Earth, but wait, actually, it's the other way aroundâ€”no, wait sorry, occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the planet must be closer to the star than the observer is. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the star is at the center. The planet orbits the star. For occultation, the planet must pass behind the star from our point of view. So the planet's orbit must be such that when it's directly behind the star, it's within the star's disk. Otherwise, it wouldn't block any light. So, in terms of angles, the planet must be within the star's apparent disk when it's behind.

So for the planet to both transit and occultate, it must be in a position where it can pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star. That means the planet's orbit must be such that
