Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-limonene in a methanol solution. Then it's stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. I remember that Pd/C is a catalyst used for hydrogenation reactions. So limonene, which is a cyclic monoterpene, probably undergoes some hydrogenation here.

Wait, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, right? It has a structure with a double bond. When hydrogenated, the double bond would add hydrogen across, turning it into a single bond. So limonene, which has two rings, maybe a double bond in one of the rings. So after hydrogenation, we get a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, limonene has a specific structure. Oh right, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a double bond between C2 and C3 in the ring. So when hydrogenated, that double bond would saturate, leading to a cyclohexane ring with certain substituents.

The problem says that after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated as major. So hydrogen is in excess? Or maybe it's a partial hydrogenation. Wait, but limonene has one double bond, so adding 1 equivalent of H2 would fully hydrogenate that double bond. So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene.

The structure of limonene is (R) configuration. So after hydrogenation, the cyclohexane would have a specific configuration.

Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic structure. Oh wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a menthofuran structure? Or is it a bicyclic monoterpene? Hmm, maybe I should recall. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that's similar to menthol but with a double bond. So it's a bicyclic monoterpene, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic monoterpene with a single ring and a double bond.

Wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure has two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered ring fused together. Oh wait, no, that's more like pinene. Maybe limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a single ring. Let me think: limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. So when hydrogenated, the double bond becomes a single bond, giving a bicyclo structure without the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should look up limonene structure. Oh wait, in this case, I can't, so I'll proceed with what I know.

So limonene to product 1: hydrogenation of the double bond. Let's consider that limonene is a bicyclic structure with a double bond. So hydrogenation would lead to a saturated bicyclic compound, perhaps like bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.

But wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic compound with a double bond, so the product after hydrogenation would be the corresponding cyc
