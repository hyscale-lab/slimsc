Okay, so I've got this physics problem about scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states, δ0 to δ4. The values are 90, 67, 55, 30, and 13 degrees respectively. And the electrons are 50 MeV. I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, all in fm units.

Wait, I remember from my studies that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) has a particular form. Oh right, for elastic scattering, it's given by a sum over all angular momentum states l. The formula is something like f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδl} [e^{i l φ} (e^{iδl} - 1) ] ... Hmm, maybe I should check the exact expression.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the partial wave expansion: f(θ) is a sum over l of ( (2l+1)/(2ik) ) * e^{2iδ_l} * ( (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) / (2i) ) * P_l(cosθ) ), but I'm not so sure. Or maybe it's f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) / (2ik) ) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ). I think that's the correct form. Yeah, because each partial wave contributes (2l+1)/(2ik) times (e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ) ... Wait, no, I think the formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ)

Where P_l are the Legendre polynomials, δ_l are the phase shifts, and k is the wave number.

The problem says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. So that would be θ = 0 degrees, because the incident beam is along the z-axis, so scattering at θ=0 would be along the same direction.

At θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1). But wait, P_l(1) is equal to 1 for all l because P_0(x)=1, P_1(x)=x, so P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)= (3x² -1)/2 evaluated at x=1 is (3(1)-1)/2=1, etc. Wait no, wait, actually, no. Wait, P_0(x)=1, P_1(x)=x, P_2(x)= (3x² -1)/2. So when x=1, P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, P_2(1
