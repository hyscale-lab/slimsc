Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending up with product 4. We need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on organic chemistry, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, let me outline the reactions:

1. Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2), forming product 1.
2. Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.
3. Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine, forming product 3.
4. Product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(Ot-Bu)3), forming product 4.

I need to figure out what each product is and then determine the structure of product 4 to count its distinct hydrogens.

Starting with the first reaction: cyclohexanone + Br2. I remember that ketones can undergo various brominations. Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Bromine could add to the carbonyl group. Oh wait, no, ketones don't usually add Br2 directly. Wait, maybe it's a different type of reaction. Oh wait, wait! Maybe it's an addition reaction such as the haloform reaction, but wait, cyclohexanone has no methyl groups adjacent to the carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a diene formation? Hmm, no, wait—another possibility: maybe it's a bromination via enol formation. Enolates can react with bromine.

Wait, cyclohexanone can undergo a keto-enol tautomerism. So, when treated with Br2, maybe the enol form reacts. So, the enolate could attack Br2, leading to a dibromide. Or perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation? Wait, no, that's when there's water involved. Alternatively, bromine could add to the carbonyl group, but I think that's more for aldehydes or ketones—wait, no, addition to the carbonyl would give a bromo alcohol, but I think with excess, maybe it becomes a di-substituted product. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening? No, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring, and bromine might not open it.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a bromination via the formation of an enol. So, cyclohexanone would form an enol, which can react with bromine. The enol has a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, so adding Br2 would lead to a di-substituted dib
