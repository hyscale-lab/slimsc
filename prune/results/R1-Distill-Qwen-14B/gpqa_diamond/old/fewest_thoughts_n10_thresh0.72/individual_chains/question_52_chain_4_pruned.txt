Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star's surface affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Alright, the star's normal Teff is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall temperature drops to 5500 K. Wait, no, wait, that's not exactly right. The question says the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. Wait, the effective temperature is a measure of the star's luminosity and radius. But in this case, since the star's radius isn't changing, the change in effective temperature must be due to the spots. Oh, but wait, the problem says when the spots cover 40% of the surface, so the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, how does that work?

Wait, the star's effective temperature is a blackbody temperature that represents the overall emission. So when parts of the star are cooler (the spots), the average temperature would be lower. But I'm not sure if the problem is considering the star's entire photosphere as having a uniform temperature. Or are the spots just a fraction of the surface at a lower temperature? Hmm, but the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the photosphere is being considered as a mix of spotted and unspotted regions, but the average Teff is 5500 K.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to temperature. The ratio is (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

So in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So the ratio would depend on T. Let me think. When the star has spots, the temperature is 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K. So the
