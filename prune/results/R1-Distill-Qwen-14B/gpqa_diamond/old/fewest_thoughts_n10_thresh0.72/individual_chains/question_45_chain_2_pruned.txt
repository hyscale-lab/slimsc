Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because quantum mechanics isn't my strongest subject. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for each particle is given by the formula E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the quantum number, m is the mass, L is the length of the well, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, the problem says E is given as E = π² ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy is E multiplied by n squared. Got it.

Since the particles are identical spin-1/2 fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. In a 1D box, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n. But wait, spin is also a factor. Spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states: up and down. So for each n, we can have two particles with opposite spins.

So for four particles, we'll need to arrange them in the lowest possible energy levels, each with a unique combination of n and spin.

Let me list out the possible states. The ground state would have the lowest energy, so n=1. For n=1, there are two possible spins, so two particles can occupy this level. Then the next level is n=2, which can also hold two particles. But wait, since we have four particles, that's exactly filled with two each in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but wait a minute. The particles are spin-1/2, so each can have spin up or down. But in a 1D box, the quantum numbers are just n. So the total state is determined by n and spin. So for each n, two particles can be placed with opposite spins. So for four particles, we can have n=1 with two particles and n=2 with two particles. So the energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but no. Wait, the particles are indistinct, so their total energy
