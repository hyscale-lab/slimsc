Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what each part is asking.

The first reaction is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second part is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I need to figure out the major products A and B and choose the correct option from A to D.

Starting with the first reaction. I think this is some kind of cycloaddition or maybe an aldol reaction. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester, which is a good Michael acceptor. And t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. Oh right, in the presence of such a base, the cyclohexanone might undergo an enolate formation, which then attacks the acrylate in a conjugate additionâ€”this is the Michael addition, right?

So, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw this structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl). So the substituents are all around the ring. The ketone is at C1, and the substituents are at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl). Wait, no, 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups at C2 and C6. But the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl, so C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with the ketone at C1, a big substituent at C2 (ethyl and methyl), and a methyl at C6.

When the base t-BuOK deprotonates the ketone, it will form an enolate. But wait, where does the enolate form? The ketone is at C1, so the alpha carbons would be C2 and C6. But C2 is already substituted with
