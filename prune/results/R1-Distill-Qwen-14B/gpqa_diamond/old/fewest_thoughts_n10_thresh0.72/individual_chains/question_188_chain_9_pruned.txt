Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, I remember from my solid state chemistry class that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and the Miller indices of the planes. Let me think about the steps I need to take to solve this.

The question gives a rhombohedral crystal. Wait, rhombohedral is one of the crystal systems, right? So I think a rhombohedral crystal is a special case where all the edges are of equal length, but the angles between them are not 90 degrees. Oh yeah, in this case, all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. So it's a trigonal crystal system.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms along the crystal axes, right? So that's the lattice parameter 'a'. So a = 10 A here.

The problem asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh, right, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the structure factors.

Wait, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (2 hk cos α)/(h+k) + (2 kl cos β
