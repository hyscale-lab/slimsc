Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it carefully. So the question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when a certain volume of acetic acid is diluted and then titrated with NaOH.

Alright, the problem states that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh right, dilution affects the concentration. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, let's break it down step by step. First, I think I should calculate the diluted concentration of acetic acid after adding water.

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and concentration is 0.05 M. The number of moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration. Wait, wait. Titration percentage usually refers to the fraction of the equivalent point reached. So 25% means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

But first, let me find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. We have 0.001 moles of acetic acid, right? So moles of NaOH needed at equivalence would be same as that. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence volume is 10 cm³.

Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, that can't be right. Because the initial acetic acid is 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, the NaOH must neutralize all of that. So 0.001 moles of NaOH needed. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no, 25% of the equivalence point is when 25% of the required NaOH is added. So yes, 2.5 cm³. Or wait, maybe it's 25% of the initial acetic acid neutralized. So yes, same thing.

So at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So let's model this.

First, the initial solution after dilution:

Volume of acetic acid solution = 40 cm³ (20 +20)
Molarity = 0.025 M.

So moles of acetic acid is 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized. So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So when 0.00025 moles of NaOH are added, they react with 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.00025 moles of CH3COO^-.

So the remaining moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025.

So the solution now has both acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate. This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1.85e-5)^-1. Let's compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 10^-4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.
