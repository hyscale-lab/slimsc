Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let me read it again. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. The options are about different power laws related to 1 over parallax to some exponent.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is distance = 1 / parallax, where parallax is in parsecs. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means a more distant star.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that their actual spatial distribution is uniform in some way. But how does that translate to parallax?

Let me think. Let's say the number density of stars is uniform, so n(r) = constant. Parallax plx is 1/r, right? So when plx increases, r decreases. So I need to find how the number of stars in a certain range of parallax depends on plx.

Wait, the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dplx) would depend on how many stars are in a thin shell at a particular distance r. Because each unit of parallax corresponds to a certain distance shell.

So, let's imagine that for a thin shell at distance r, the volume of that shell would be 4πr² dr. Because the volume of a spherical shell is surface area times thickness. So if you have a thin shell of thickness dr, its volume is 4πr² dr.

The number of stars in that shell would be the number density times the volume. Since number density is uniform, n, the number is n * 4πr² dr.

But parallax plx is 1/r, so r = 1/plx. Let me substitute r into the equation. So, the number of stars in a shell at parallax plx would be n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dr).

Wait, but dr is the change in radius, and how does that relate to the change in parallax? Let me think about differentials. Because plx = 1/r, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, let me see: if plx = 1/r, then differentiating both sides, dplx = - (1/r²) dr. So dr = - r² dplx. But since r = 1/plx, dr = -(1/plx²) dplx.

But when I'm integrating, I think the negative will take care of the direction. But for the number of stars per unit plx, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax plx would be n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But dr is (dr = -(1/plx²) dplx). Wait, so substituting, the number becomes n *4π (1/plx^2) * [ -(1/plx²) dplx ].

Wait, but the negative just indicates the direction of change (as plx increases, r decreases), but when considering the magnitude, I can ignore the sign because
