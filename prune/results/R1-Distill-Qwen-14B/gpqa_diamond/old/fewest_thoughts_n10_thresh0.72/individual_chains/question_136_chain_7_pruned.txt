Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, right. The divergence theorem comes into play here, I think. Because the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary. But wait, the problem is directly asking about the volume integral, so maybe I can compute it directly without using the theorem, but perhaps using the theorem would make things easier.

Wait, let me think. The divergence theorem says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. So ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector. 

So maybe if I can compute the flux through the surface of the sphere of radius R, that would give me the value of the volume integral. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the easiest way. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the divergence of f in spherical coordinates and then integrate it over the volume.

Alright, let's try both approaches. Maybe start with computing the divergence.
