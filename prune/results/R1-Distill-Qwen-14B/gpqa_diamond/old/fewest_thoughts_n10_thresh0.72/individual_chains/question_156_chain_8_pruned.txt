Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reactions involving mCPBA and what happens when the products are analyzed using HPLC. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, let's break down what's happening in each reaction. The question mentions two reactions: one with (E)-oct-4-ene and another with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.

I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation is when a double bond reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. So, in both reactions, the starting alkenes will form epoxides.

Wait, but the stereochemistry of the starting alkenes is different. The first one is E, and the second is Z. So, when each reacts with mCPBA, what happens?

Epoxidation with mCPBA is a stereospecific reaction. The mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For an (E) alkene, which is trans, the epoxidation would form a trans epoxide? Or wait, maybe it's the same as the starting alkene's configuration. Let me think: the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene because the endo transition state leads to the same configuration.

Wait, no. Actually, in epoxidation, the two oxygen atoms add to the same face of the double bond. So the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For a trans (E) starting alkene, the epoxide formed would have the oxygen atoms on opposite sides? Or same?

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. The double bond is E configuration, so the two substituents on either end are opposite each other. When mCPBA attacks, it does so in a concerted manner, adding an oxygen across the double bond. Since the reaction proceeds with syn addition, the epoxide will have the two oxygen atoms on the same face. So for an E double bond, the substituents are on opposite sides. When the epoxide forms, the substituents on the epoxide carbons would be on the same face, leading to a trans epoxide? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the result is a cis
