Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question here. Hmm, let me think. I remember that neutrinos are produced in the sun, right? And the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Wait, what's the pp-III branch again?

Oh right, in the Sun's core, there are different proton-proton (pp) chains. The main pp-I chain is the dominant one for energy production, I think. Then there's pp-II and pp-III which are less significant. Oh wait, pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos. Because, I remember that the pp-I chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, maybe around a few hundred keV, while the pp-III branch produces higher-energy ones, like 700-800 keV or so.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So, that means we're considering the current state, but without the pp-III contribution. Oh wait, but neutrinos take about 8 minutes to reach Earth, right? So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have already reached us. Or wait, wait a second. No, the neutrinos are produced and leave the Sun. So if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from that process would stop being emitted. So any neutrinos from the pp-III would have already left the Sun, or not? Because, for instance, the Sun's core is where the pp reactions happen, but neutrinos are produced and then escape. So if the
