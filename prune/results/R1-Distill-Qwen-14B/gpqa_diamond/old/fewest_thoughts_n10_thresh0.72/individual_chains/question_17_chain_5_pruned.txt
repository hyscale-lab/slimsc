Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. 

Let me read the problem again. The solution has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh, and the pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. So I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions, right?

Wait, when a metal ion like Ca²+ binds with EDTA, it forms a complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant, K, is given. K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. 

So the formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). But wait, in this problem, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, but we're given K, I think I can set up an equation to find the concentration of Ca²+.

Assuming that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, let's denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then, when the complex dissociates, it would release x amount of Ca²+ and x amount of EDTA^4−. But wait, wait. Are the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− the same? Because each mole of complex gives one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So yes, they would be equal.

So the K expression would be K = [CaEDTA^2−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] ). Since the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is much larger than the concentrations of the individual ions, right? Because if K is large, the complex doesn't dissociate much. Wait, K is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, so the dissociation is minimal. So the assumption is that x is
