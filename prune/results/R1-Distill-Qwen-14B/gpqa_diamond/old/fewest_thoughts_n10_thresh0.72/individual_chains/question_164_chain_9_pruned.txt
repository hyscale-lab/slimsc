Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems based on their radial velocity amplitudes and orbital periods. 

Let me read the problem again. So, there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses. The periods are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. The radial velocity (RV) variations are sinusoidal. 

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Wait, I think I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude is related to the mass of the other star in the system. The formula I think is K = (v) = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ), where M2 is the mass of the companion. But wait, in a binary system, each star's RV is related to the other's mass. So for a binary, M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. Because both are orbiting the same center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, yes, because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. And since velocity v is proportional to a * (2π/P), so K is proportional to a. So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, so M1/M2 = K2/K1.

But in this problem, each system has two stars. So for system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. So that would mean M1a / M1b = K_b / K_a. Wait, no, let me think again. Let's say in system_1, the two stars are M1 and M2. Their velocities are K1 and K2. Then,
