Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what value the algorithm gives for the input ACAGTGACC. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA ->176. Hmm, I remember from some bio stuff that DNA sequences are made up of nucleotides, which are A, T, C, G. But how does that translate to numbers?

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is converted into a number somehow. Let me think about the examples. AGG outputs 115. So each letter corresponds to a number. Let's break it down.

AGG is three letters. If each letter is a digit, then maybe A is 1, G is 7 (since G is the 7th letter in the alphabet?), and another G would be 7. So A=1, G=7, G=7. So 1,7,7. Wait, but that's 177, not 115. That doesn't add up.

Alternatively, maybe each letter is a single digit in a base higher than 10, but how? Like A=10, G=7? But that would be 10,7,7. So in base 10, that's 10*100 +7*10 +7= 1070 +70 +7 = 1147, which is way bigger than 115. So that's not it.

Hmm, maybe each nucleotide's position is summed. Oh wait, wait. Maybe each nucleotide is assigned a number and we sum them. Let's see. For AGG: A, G, G. If A is 1, G is 7, sum is 1+7+7=15. But that's 15, but the output is 115. Hmm, doesn't fit.

Another idea: perhaps each nucleotide is represented as a digit in a number, but maybe in a different base. Let's think about the first example: AGG â†’ 115.

If AGG is a 3-digit number in base 10, that's 1,1,5. But that's 115, which matches the output. Wait! So perhaps each nucleotide is converted into a digit, but how? Because G is 7 in the alphabet,
