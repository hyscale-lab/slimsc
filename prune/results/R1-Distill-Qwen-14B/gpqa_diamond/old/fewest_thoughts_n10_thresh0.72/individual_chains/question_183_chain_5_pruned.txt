Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B) 3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated based on the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But in this case, I think the starting material and reagents are key.

Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh right, that's the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait no, wait. Wait, red phosphorus and HI usually lead to elimination reactions, but wait, wait another thing. Oh, I think that's more about the dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, I remember that when an alkyne is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it gets converted into a dihalide. Or wait, maybe it's more about the addition of iodine across double bonds.

Wait, no, another thought. Red phosphorus is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for removing carbonyl groups. Wait, but in this case, the starting material has a formyl group (a carbonyl) and a vinyl group (a double bond), and a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. So, a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond). At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So the substituents are at positions 2 and 5 on the cyclohexene ring.

So, the structure would be a cyclohexene (so ring with one double bond)
