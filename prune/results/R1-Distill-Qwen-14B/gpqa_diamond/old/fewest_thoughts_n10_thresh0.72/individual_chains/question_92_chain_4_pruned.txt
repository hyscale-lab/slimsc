Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. I need to find its enthalpy of formation. Wait, I remember that enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Oh right, and sometimes it's calculated using bond energies.

They've given me some bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. Oh, and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, atomization is breaking bonds to make atoms, right? So that might be used to find bond energies if needed.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused. Oh, maybe I can use Hess's Law here, where I calculate the total energy change based on bond energies.

So the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Actually, when forming the molecule from elements, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, and products are the bonds in the molecule. Alternatively, maybe it's the bonds
