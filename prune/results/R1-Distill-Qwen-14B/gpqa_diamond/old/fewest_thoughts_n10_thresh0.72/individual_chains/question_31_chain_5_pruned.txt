Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry of the final product. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

First, the starting material is toluene. I remember that toluene is methylbenzene, a benzene ring with a methyl group attached. The first reaction is treating it with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. Oh right, that's a nitrating mixture. So nitration of toluene occurs. The methyl group is an activating group, so the nitration should happen at the para position first? Or wait, toluene is more reactive than benzene, so the nitro group will substitute the hydrogen in the ring. Since the methyl is an activating group, the nitration should occur in the para position predominantly, but maybe some ortho as well. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene, I think. So the structure is a benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group opposite each other.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. For nitrotoluenes, oxidation can lead to different products depending on the conditions. Wait, MnO2 in sulfuric acid usually oxidizes nitro groups. Let me think: para-nitrotoluene when oxidized. The methyl group attached to the ring, when oxidized, would typically turn into a carboxylic acid. Because the methyl (ch3) becomes COOH. So the nitro group is already present, and the methyl becomes a COOH group. So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzoic acid. Wait, wait. No, wait: the structure of product 1 is methyl group and nitro group on benzene. When the methyl is oxidized, it's replaced by COOH. So the structure becomes nitrobenzoic acid. So the substituents are COOH and NO2 on the benzene ring. 

But wait, where are they located? The original para-nitrotoluene has methyl and nitro in para positions. After oxidation, the methyl becomes COOH, so the substituents are COOH and NO2 in para positions. So product 2 is para-nitrobenzoic acid, I think.

Then, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydro
