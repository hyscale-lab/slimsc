Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about isomers and some compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question talks about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. From what I remember, constitutional isomers have different connectivity of atoms, like how propane can be a straight chain or branched. Stereoisomers, on the other hand, have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, such as enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. 

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism.

Wait, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different structures, right? Like the keto-enol tautomerism in ketones and aldehydes. Tautomerism typically requires certain structural features, like adjacent keto and enol groups.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Hmm, does it have adjacent positions for tautomerism? Let's see, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho, but I think the common ones are para. So for para-benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are opposite each other. Does that arrangement allow for enol tautomerism? Well, the enol form would require adjacent carbonyl groups, maybe. Wait, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at a para position. So maybe they're not adjacent, so no enol form possible. So no tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, each separated by a carbon. So positions 1, 3, and 5. That means each ketone is adjacent to another. So for instance, position 1 is adjacent to position 2, which is next to position 3, and so on. Wait, no, the numbering
