Okay, so I have this question where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see what the options are and how the spectral data can help me.

First, the IR data shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually from N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound has an amino group (since the formula has N), but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me think, the IR has two strong bands in that region, maybe they're from an amide N-H. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group, like a ketone, ester, or amide.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

Hmm, let's think about each one.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be a benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. The benzamide group has a carbonyl (so IR at ~1720), and the amide N-H would show up as peaks around 3300-3500, which matches the IR here.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide has a formyl group (HCONR2), so the carbonyl would be around 1720. The N-H of the formamide would give a peak around 3300-3500. Also, the ethoxy group would have its own signals.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, but this is 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would be like NH2-C6H4-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO- but the ester part would be ethyl or something else. Alternatively, it's (propanoic acid) attached to the benzene via an ester. So, the structure would have an amino group (NH2) on the benzene ring and a propionate ester. So the IR would show N-H (amine) stretch, which is around 3300-3500, and the carbonyl (ester) around 1720. But wait, the question's IR has two bands at 3420 and 3325. Amines usually have a single or sometimes two N-H stretches, but maybe if it's an amide, it's different.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So, the benzene ring has an amino group and a COOEt group. The amino group is NH2, which would have N-H stretches in IR (so 3420 and 3325 could be that). The ester carbonyl would be at 1720, which matches. But wait, an ester's carbonyl is usually a bit lower than a ketone but higher than an amide. So yes, 1720 is typical for esters.

Wait, but looking at the H NMR:

The NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester's terminal CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet, maybe an OCH2 group, but could also be an NH2 if exchange broadening is happening. But wait, in D, the ethyl ester would have OCH2CH3. So in the NMR
