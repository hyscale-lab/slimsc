Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The term is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. It looks like the interaction is between the boson X and fermions ψ_f. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the allowed decay channels for X at the lowest order.

So, the first thing I remember is that for a boson to decay into fermions, the fermion mass must be less than half the boson's mass. Because in decay processes, each product must have enough energy, so each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than the mass of X. Oh wait, no, because when a boson decays into two particles, each needs to have energy, but their rest mass is the key. So the sum of the rest masses must be less than the mass of the boson. Wait, no, because when a particle decays, the total energy is conserved. But in the center of mass frame, the initial particle is at rest. So the rest mass of each product must be less than half the mass of the boson because the decay products need to have enough energy to each have rest mass.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. For a boson X with mass M decaying into two fermions (like a quark-antiquark pair or a lepton and anti-lepton), each fermion must have a mass m such that 2m ≤ M. Because each fermion will carry away some energy and momentum, but their rest mass must be less than or equal to half of M. Because if M is the total rest mass, then each fermion would need to have at least up to M/2 each, but in reality, the sum of their rest masses must not exceed M. Wait, but for a pair of particles, each has rest mass m, so the total rest mass is 2m. So for the decay to be possible, 2m ≤ M.

So M_x is 6 GeV. So each fermion must have a mass m ≤ 3 GeV. Because 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So now I need to list all fermions (quarks and leptons) with masses less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The masses of the particles as per the Standard Model.

Let me list the known fermion masses:

Leptons:

Electron: about 0.0005 GeV (negligible)
Muon: ~0.1057 GeV
Tau: about 1.78 GeV

Quarks:

Up: ~2.2 MeV (but in the context of effective theory, considering confinement, maybe we take current masses. But in reality, up and down are very light.)

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the constituent quark masses, but I'm not sure. Wait, in particle physics, when considering decays, we usually look at the rest masses. For quarks, their current masses are:

Up: ~2.2 MeV
Down: ~4.7 MeV
Strange: ~100 MeV (but I think it's more like around 95 MeV)
Charm: ~1.275 GeV
Bottom: ~4.13 GeV
Top: ~173 GeV

So for quarks:

Up: ~0.0022 GeV
Down: ~0.0047 GeV
Strange: ~0.095 GeV
Charm: ~1.275 GeV
Bottom: ~4.13 GeV
Top: way too big (173 GeV)

Leptons:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
Muon: ~0.105 GeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV

So applying the condition that fermion mass m ≤3 GeV for each pair. So any fermion with mass up to 3 GeV can be produced in pairs from X.

Wait, but X has a mass of 6 GeV. So for a pair of particles, each must have m ≤3 GeV.

So let's see which fermions satisfy m ≤3 GeV.

Leptons: all of them, since even the tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3. So
