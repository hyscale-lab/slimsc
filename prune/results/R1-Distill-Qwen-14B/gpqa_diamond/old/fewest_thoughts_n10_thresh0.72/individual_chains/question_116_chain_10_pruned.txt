Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

The question involves several compounds: A, B, C, D. Let's start with compound A. The proton NMR data for A says it has two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that triplet and quartet in NMR usually indicate coupling between different sets of protons. So, the triplet with 6H probably comes from two equivalent CH3 groups, each with three protons. Because 6H divided by 3 gives two groups. And a triplet means each of these CH3 is next to a CH2 group, which has two protons. So maybe it's like two CH2CH3 groups?

Wait, no. Wait, the triplet for 6Hâ€”maybe it's two CH3 groups attached to something that has two neighboring groups. Or perhaps the triplet is from a CH2 group next to another CH2. Let me think. Alternatively, in a di-substituted structure, maybe like an ethyl group. Oh wait, wait. The triplet (integration 6H) is at 0.9 ppm, which is typical for a CH3 next to a CH2. And the quartet (4H) at 1.3 ppm is a CH2 group next to another CH2. So, maybe it's an ethyl group connected to something else.

Wait, but A shows two signals. So, two different types of protons. So, perhaps compound A is a diethyl ether? Because diethyl ether has two ethyl groups attached to oxygen. The ethyl groups would have CH2CH3, so each CH3 group would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH2), and each CH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH3). But wait, diethyl ether would have two equivalent ethyl groups. So in NMR, the CH2 groups would be split into a quartet, and the CH3 into a triplet, each integrating to 4 H and 6 H respectively. That matches the data. So compound A is diethyl ether, O(CH2CH3)2.

Next, compound A undergoes monobromination to form B. Mon
