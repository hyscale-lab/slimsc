Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of Compound X and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start by looking at the spectral data provided.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of an -OH group or maybe an alkyne. The peaks around 1700 cm-1 are typical for carbonyl groups like ketones, aldehydes, or esters. Wait, 1720 is a bit higher, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So this compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which suggests an -OH proton. But wait, sometimes aldehydic protons can be around 9-10 ppm, but they are usually deshielded and might appear as a singlet. However, the broadness here makes me think it's more likely an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR had 1720 cm-1, which is more like a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, which matches. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, but a carboxylic acid proton is usually a broad peak, yeah. So that might fit.

Next, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) probably correspond to an aromatic ring with substituents. The doublets suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. So like a para-substituted benzene, maybe with two substituents opposite each other.

What about the other signals? 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) - that's possibly a methylene or a CH group in some environment, maybe adjacent to an oxygen or another group. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another
