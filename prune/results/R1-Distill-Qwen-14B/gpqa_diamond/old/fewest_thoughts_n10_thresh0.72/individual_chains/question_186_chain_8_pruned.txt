Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Cope rearrangement of a specific bicyclic compound. Hmm, I need to figure out what the product would look like after the reaction. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Cope rearrangement.

The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. Wait, but wait—does it also happen in other systems? Oh right, it's usually between two conjugated alkenes separated by a single bond. So in the case of a bicyclic compound, the arrangement might be a bit different.

The starting material given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me break that down. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like a norbornane structure. The substituents here are an azabicyclo, so that's a nitrogen in the ring. Specifically, the 2-azabicyclo would mean the nitrogen is at position 2. The compound also has a vinyl group (a double bond) at position 2. Wait, no—the formula says 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo. Oh, so the substituents are both on the same carbon, carbon 2. So that carbon is attached to a vinyl group and is part of the azabicyclo ring.

So the structure is a norbornene derivative. Let me imagine the structure. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a double bond between carbons 5 and 6 (since the bridgeheads are 1 and 4, I think). Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Let me try to sketch the structure.

The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would have two bridge segments. The main ring is a seven-membered
