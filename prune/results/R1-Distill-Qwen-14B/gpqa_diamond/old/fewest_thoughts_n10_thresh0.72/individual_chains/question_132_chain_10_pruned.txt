Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, the options given are all tetramethylbenzenes except one, which is diethyl. Let me list the options again:

Options:
A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Wait, the first three options (A, B, D) involve two tetramethylbenzenes each, while option C has one tetramethyl and one diethyl.

I remember that in aromatic compounds, the substituents affect the NMR signals. The aromatic protons are deshielded, so they appear around 6-8 ppm. But the substituents (like methyl groups) are usually in the aliphatic region, like around 1-2 ppm.

In the given NMR, there are two singlets in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm), each in 1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, but each compound's aromatic protons split into their own signals, maybe each compound contributes a singlet.

Wait, each compound's aromatic ring might have equivalent protons, leading to a singlet. So the two singlets of 1:1 ratio suggest that each compound has a single type of aromatic proton, and each contributes a singlet in the NMR.

So both compounds should have a symmetry that makes all aromatic protons equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, but for a tetramethylbenzene, if all four methyl groups are in a symmetrical arrangement, the remaining protons would be equivalent. Let me think about each structure.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: That's a benzene with methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. Wait, that's a tetrakis (maybe called para positions?), but wait, 1,2,3,4 would be adjacent, making a 1,2,3,4-tetra arrangement. Wait, that's a bit crowded, but let me think about symmetry.

Alternatively, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is actually the same as 1,2,3,4-tetra-substituted benzene. So in this structure, the substituents are in positions 1,
