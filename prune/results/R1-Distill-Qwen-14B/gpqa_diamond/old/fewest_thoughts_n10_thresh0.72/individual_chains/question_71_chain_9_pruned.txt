Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the distance from their star, right? But wait, how exactly does that work? Oh right, the formula I think is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσD²))^(1/4), but wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the inverse square law. Oh yeah, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L / D²)^(1/4), assuming the same albedo and other factors. But since all the planets have the same albedo, we can ignore that part for the ratio.

So the key here is the distance from the star, D. The period of the planet's orbit is related to D via Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is D here because the orbits are circular). So P² ∝ D³. 

The planets are in orbital resonance, which probably means their orbital periods are in a ratio as given: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are P1=1x, P2=2x, P3=2.5x, P4=3.5x, P5=5x, where x is some unit period.

Wait, but how does the period relate to the distance? From Kepler's law, P² = (4π²/GM) * D³. So D is proportional to P^(
