Okay, so I've got this question here about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and break it down.

The question says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here because I think the question is more about the elemental abundances. Oh wait, the problem says to use the EW method, which I think relates to equivalent widths for measuring abundances. But maybe the mass isn't directly relevant for the calculation.

The elemental abundances given are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2.

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^(-5)

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2]?

Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is [n_Si, Star_1] / [n_Si, Star_2]. I think that's what it's asking for.

But how do I get the silicon abundance in each star?

I remember that the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X and Y relative to the Sun's ratio.

So, for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si/n_Fe, Star1) - log(n_Si/n_Fe, Sun) = 0.3 → log(n_Si/n_Fe, Star1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si/n_Fe, Sun).

Wait, the Sun's [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y)_star - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means that log(n_Si/n_Fe, Star1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si/n_Fe, Sun).

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg/n_Si, Star2) =0.3 + log(n_Mg/n_Si, Sun).

Wait, but I need to find [Si/Fe] for each star, or maybe find the [Si/H]
