Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance given the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The formula I think is something like distance = velocity * lifetime. Right, because particles moving at a certain speed for a certain time cover a certain distance.

Wait, but how do I calculate the lifetime? Oh right, the lifetime is connected to the width of the resonance via the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the uncertainty in energy (which is the width Γ) multiplied by the lifetime τ is about ħ over 2. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, no, more accurately, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to make sure about the units here.

Let me write down the formula for the mean decay length. The mean decay length L is given by L = βγ c τ, where β is the velocity over the speed of light, γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I've heard that the mean path length is L = (E / m) * τ. Because for
