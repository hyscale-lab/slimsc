Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, Planet3. They use the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But maybe that's just the method they used to discover them, so not sure if that's relevant here.

The main data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by that factor. Then between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3, so Planet2 is less hot than Planet3? Wait, no, because the ratio is Planet2 to Planet3, right? So the ratio is Planet2/Planet3 = 2.3? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So I think it's T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 ≈ 2.3. So T2 is 2.3 times T3. Wait, no, because if it's T2 over T3, then T2 is larger. So T2 = 2.3 * T3. So T3 would be T2 / 2.3.

Wait, maybe I should write down the ratios:

T1 / T2 ≈ 1.4 → T1 = 1.4 * T2
T2 / T3 ≈ 2.3 → T2 = 2.3 * T3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3

So putting that together, T1 = 1.4 * (2.3 * T3) = 3.22 * T3. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's needed right now. Maybe I don't even need the temperatures for calculating the orbital period.

Next, the mass ratios. The mass of Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15 → M1 = 1.15 * M2.

Then, the mass of Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35 → M2 = 1.35 * M3 → M3 = M2 / 1.35.

So, M1 = 1.15 * M2 → M1 = 1.15 * (1.35*M3) → M1 = 1.5525 * M3. So M1 is about 1.55 times M3.

But wait, I'm not sure how masses relate to orbital periods. Maybe I'm mixing something up.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So, how does the period relate to other factors like mass and temperature?

Wait, the planets are in a system, so I think each planet is orbiting the same star. The orbital period would depend on the distance from the star and the mass of the star. But the problem doesn't give the star's mass, so maybe the masses of the planets don't matter here. Hmm, but why are the masses given then?

Wait, equilibrium temperature is given for each planet. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [(L*(1 - a))/(16πσd²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star. Since all three have the same albedo (0.3), and assuming they orbit the same star, L and a are the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature only depends on the distance d.

So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(d), because T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance since T^4 is proportional to 1/d². So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(d).

So, T1 / T2 = 1.4 → sqrt(d2)/sqrt(d1) = 1.4 → d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = 1.96 * d1.

Similarly, T2 / T3 = 2.3 → sqrt(d3)/sqrt(d2) = 2.3 → d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 ≈ 5.29 → d3 = 5.29 * d2.

So, substituting d2 from before: d3 = 5.29 * (1.96 d1) ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 d1. Let me calculate that: 5.29 * 2 is about 10.58, but 1.96 is a bit less than 2. So 5.29 * 1.96 = let's compute it accurately.

5.29 × 1.96: 5 × 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 × 1.96 is approx 0.5684. Summing gives 10.3684. So d3 ≈ 10.3684 * d1.

So the distance d3 is about 10.37 times the distance d1.

Now, the orbital period depends on the distance from the star. Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star). Since all planets have circular orbits, the period P is given by:

P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) * a³.

Assuming the star's mass M_star is much larger than the planet masses, so M_star is approximately the same for each planet. So, P² ∝ a³ → P ∝ a^(3/2).

So, the ratio of periods P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2).

We found d3/d1 ≈ 10.37.

So, (10.37)^(3/2) → let's compute that.

First, sqrt(10.37) ≈ 3.22. Then, 3.22 cubed is approx 3.22 * 3.22 *3.22.

Wait, 3.22 squared is about 10.3684. Then multiplying
