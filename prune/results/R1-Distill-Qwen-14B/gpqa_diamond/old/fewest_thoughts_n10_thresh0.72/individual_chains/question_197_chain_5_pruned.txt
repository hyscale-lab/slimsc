Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow.

So, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that reactions involving red phosphorus and HI usually deoxygenate certain groups. Wait, like maybe esters or amides? Oh right! If you have an ester reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it typically leads to the formation of an alkane. Because the ester group is converted into an alcohol, but wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh, wait, maybe it's more about elimination. Or maybe it's about removing oxygen from certain functional groups.

Wait, the reaction I'm recalling is the reaction of an ester with excess HI in the presence of red phosphorus. Red phosphorus is a catalyst in some reactions, but in this case, I think it's used to deoxygenate the ester. So, when an ester reacts with HI and red phosphorus, the oxygen in the ester is replaced by hydrogen. So, the ester group (R-O-CO-O-R') would become R-H and R'-H, but wait, that's not quite right. Wait, no, ester is RCOOR', and when you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it typically leads to the formation of an alkane. The mechanism, I think, is that the ester is converted into an alkyne via deoxygenationâ€”no, wait, maybe it's a double bond. Or perhaps the est
