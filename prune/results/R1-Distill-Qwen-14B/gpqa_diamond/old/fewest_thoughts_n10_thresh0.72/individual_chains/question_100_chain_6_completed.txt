Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 is propene because propene has the formula C3H6 (double bond between carbons 1 and 2). So, A is propene.

First reaction: A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. I think bromination of alkenes usually adds bromine across the double bond because CCl4 is a solvent for such reactions. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add bromine to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, right? So when bromine adds across the double bond, it becomes CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. That's compound B.

Next, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base and a good nucleophile, so this is likely an elimination reaction. Since B is a dibromide, when treated with a strong base, it should eliminate HBr to form an alkene again. But wait, the starting point was propene, and after addition and elimination, we might get the same or a different alkene?

Wait, in the addition of bromine to propene, the bromines add to adjacent carbons. So if we have CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, elimination would remove one Br from each adjacent carbon. So when we treat with alcoholic KOH, it would deprotonate and eliminate, forming an alkene. But wait, the starting alkene was CH2=CHCH3. When we add Br2, it's a vicinal dihalide; when we eliminate, we might get the same alkene back, but possibly in a different position if there's any possibility of different structures. Wait, in this case, the dihalide is on the central carbons. So elimination would form either 1-propene or 2-propene? Wait, no. Let me think, the dihalide is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Eliminating HBr from adjacent Br atoms would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 or 2 and 3?

Wait, if you take the structure CH2Br-CHBr-CH3 and eliminate two HBr molecules, you can form either 1,2-diene or what? No, wait, elimination is E2, so it's one HBr elimination, then another. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no, when you have a vicinal dihalide, elimination of two HBr molecules would form an alkyne. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, if you have two adjacent Br atoms, and you eliminate two HBr molecules, you form a triple bond. So from CH2BrCHBrCH3, eliminating two HBr would give CH2-C≡CH. Wait, that would be propyne (HC≡C-CH3). Oh, right! So compound C is propyne.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 gives CH2BrCHBrCH3. Then, treating with alcoholic KOH (a strong base) would cause dehydrohalogenation. But since it's a vicinal dihalide, it can eliminate twice, losing two HBr molecules to form an alkyne. So the product is propyne, which is HC≡C-CH3. So compound C is propyne.

Next, compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube. I remember that when alkynes react with red-hot iron, they undergo dehydrohalogenation or some kind of decomposition. Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Another thought: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, propyne is an alkyne. Oh, wait, when an alkyne is treated with a strong base, under certain conditions, it can form a diene or something else. Wait, another possibility: heating an alkyne with a catalyst might cause it to form allene or something, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrogenation? No, red-hot iron is more about dehydrogenation or other reactions.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit stuck here. What happens when an alkyne is passed over red-hot iron? I think another possibility is that the alkyne undergoes dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, C is propyne, which is an alkyne, not an alkene. Another thought: maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated. Wait, but for hydrogenation, you usually have a catalyst like Pd or Pt, I think. Alternatively, when an alkyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it decomposes. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction of propyne with red-hot iron. Maybe it's a decomposition reaction. Wait, propyne (HC≡C-CH3) on heating might undergo some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form an alkyne with less hydrogen. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene. But how?

Wait, another angle: propyne (HC≡C-CH3) passed through red-hot iron. I think that the reaction here is the dehydrogenation of the alkyne to form an alkene. Wait, but how? Let me think. Wait, when an alkyne is treated with a catalyst like iron, perhaps it can hydrogenate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a diene via dehydrohalogenation. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to form an alkane. No, wait, that would require hydrogen and a catalyst.

Wait, maybe I should think of the product of the reaction of propyne with red-hot iron as propene again? Or maybe another product. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, another thought: maybe the alkyne is protonated, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product. The next step is that compound D is formed. Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Then E, in the presence of iron and HCl, forms F. Then F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Then G reacts with NaOH to form H.

But getting back to the step where C (propyne) is passed through red-hot iron to form D. Another possibility: maybe the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene. Wait, but without a catalyst, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction. Wait, I'm not making progress on this step. Let me see what happens after D.

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Two strong acids—maybe sulfuric and nitric, which are commonly used as nitrating agents. So perhaps D is undergoing a nitration reaction. If D is an aromatic compound, then E would be the nitrated product. But wait, where did the aromatic ring come from?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about D. Another approach: Let me list all the steps as I can.

A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3)
B: propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
C: B + alcoholic KOH → eliminate two HBr → propyne (HC≡CCH3)
D: propyne (C) → through red-hot iron → ?

Wait, I'm stuck on D. Let me think again. Another reaction: When propyne is treated with a red-hot iron, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation? But propyne doesn't have any halides. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being hydrogenated. Wait, but without H2, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an alkene via some mechanism. Or maybe it's a decomposition reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should think about other possible reactions for propyne. Another possibility: Maybe when propyne is heated with a metal like iron, it undergoes a decomposition reaction, such as breaking into smaller molecules. For example, maybe it forms acetylene and methane? Or perhaps it undergoes some kind of isomerization.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound C. Let me double-check. So, compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3). When treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate HBr. Since it's a vicinal dihalide, two HBr molecules would be eliminated, leading to the formation of an alkyne.

Wait, the elimination of two HBr from 1,2-dibromopropane would form propyne (HC≡C-CH3). So yes, C is propyne.

Now, propyne is HC≡C-CH3. When heated with red-hot iron, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation reaction to form something else. Wait, but propyne is already an alkyne. Wait, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated. But without H2, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene. Wait, another possibility: the alkyne could undergo a reaction to form a double bond via isomerization. But propyne is an alkyne, and perhaps under certain conditions, it can form an alkene.

Wait, another angle: When an alkyne is passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's subjected to hydrogenation, but since there's no H2, perhaps the iron is a catalyst for some other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a different compound. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product D. If D is reacting with two strong acids to form E, which is then treated with iron and HCl to form F. So after D, we're adding two strong acids, possibly for nitration or sulfonation.

Wait, perhaps D is benzene? Because then, nitration would form nitrobenzene, and other reactions would follow. But how would D become benzene?

Wait, maybe I'm missing a step. Let me go back. If C is propyne (HC≡C-CH3), and D is formed by passing through red-hot iron, perhaps D is propene again. Because maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to the alkene. But I thought that usually requires a catalyst like Ni, and H2. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being converted into an alkene via some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is undergoing a decomposition to form something else. Another thought: perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a diene via a di-elimination. Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another angle: perhaps D is propene (CH2=CHCH3). Then, when D reacts with two strong acids (like concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3), it would undergo nitration. But where would the nitro group go? Wait, but propene is an alkene, not an aromatic compound. So nitration wouldn't happen unless it's a diene or something else.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again about the steps. Let's say that D is benzene. Then, E would be nitrobenzene after nitration. Then, when E reacts with Fe and HCl, it would reduce the nitro group to an amine. So F would be phenylamine or something similar. Then, when F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), it would form a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with NaOH would form phenol (if it's aromatic). So H would be phenol, which gives a brown color with FeCl3, but option B says it gives a yellow color. That doesn't align, but let's see.

Alternatively, maybe D is toluene. Then, E would be nitrotoluene, F would be toluene amine (toluidine), then G would be the diazonium salt, and H would be benzoic acid after hydrolysis. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps after the alkyne is passed through red-hot iron, it forms an alkene with a different structure. Let me think about what happens when an alkyne is treated with red-hot iron. I'm trying to recall: perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about each step's products and see if any options can be eliminated.

Option D says that compound C is a flammable gas. If C is propyne, which is an alkyne, it's a gas under standard conditions. So yes, it's flammable. So option D is correct, so it's not the incorrect statement.

Looking at the options, the question is about identifying the incorrect statement.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is aniline or a derivative, which is used in dye-making, that's correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride test is for phenols, which give a brown color. So if H is a phenol, this would be incorrect. Or maybe another compound that gives a yellow color.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. Let's say D is toluene. Toluene's NMR would have a singlet for the methyl group attached to benzene, and another for the aromatic protons (but aromatic protons are usually more complex unless it's something like xylenes). Alternatively, if D is benzene, its NMR doesn't have any protons, so that can't be right.

Wait, but let's think again. If after step C, D is an alkyne, but perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps D is a di-substituted alkene, which might have different NMR signals.

Wait, perhaps I should map out all the compounds step by step.

Let me try to outline each step again:

A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3)

B: propene + Br2 (in CCl4) → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)

C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → elimination to form propyne (HC≡CCH3)

D: propyne passed through red-hot iron → ?

Hmm, maybe this step forms propene. How? If propyne is subjected to hydrogenation, but without H2, perhaps the iron is acting as a catalyst for some other reaction. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is polymerized, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to the alkene using Fe as a catalyst. So propyne + H2 (from where?) → propene. But without H2 gas, maybe Fe isn't acting as a catalyst here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a different compound. Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is being dehydrohalogenated again, but that doesn't make sense because it's already an alkyne.

Wait, another idea: maybe the alkyne is undergoing a decomposition reaction to form a different structure. For example, perhaps it's breaking down into smaller molecules, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an alkene via a different mechanism. Maybe via a hydration reaction, but that requires water and a catalyst. But in this case, the reagent is red-hot iron, which I'm not familiar with in this context.

Wait, maybe I'm stuck on this step. Let me assume that D is propene and see where that leads.

So D is propene (CH2=CHCH3). Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Two strong acids could be sulfuric and nitric, which is used in nitration. But propene isn't aromatic, so nitration wouldn't proceed. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps D is something else. Let's think differently. Maybe after the alkyne is passed through red-hot iron, it forms benzene. How? Perhaps via a decomposition or some kind of cyclization. But I don't see how propyne would form benzene upon heating with iron.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction. Maybe when propyne is treated with red-hot iron, it forms phenol or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene. Then, E would be nitrobenzene, F would be phenylamine, G would be the diazonium salt, which upon treatment with NaOH would form phenol (H). Phenol gives a brown color with FeCl3, so option B would be incorrect as it says yellow. So if the statement is that H gives yellow with FeCl3, that's incorrect. But let's see what each option says.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. If H is phenol, it gives brown, so this statement is incorrect. But I'm not sure about the steps leading to H. So perhaps the incorrect statement is in option B.

Alternatively, perhaps D is toluene. So after D is toluene, E would be nitrotoluene. Then F would be toluene amine (toluidine), which upon treatment with nitrous acid would form a diazonium chloride. Then, when treated with NaOH, it would form benzoic acid (if it's aromatic) or something else. But benzoic acid and phenol both give brown colors with FeCl3, not yellow.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps D is cyclohexane or another cycloalkane, but I don't see the steps leading there.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the reaction steps. Let me think again about propyne reacting with red-hot iron. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see any halogens left.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a different alkyne. For example, maybe the triple bond shifts. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the products in the options to see which one is incorrect.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is toluene, its NMR would show a singlet for the three methyl protons attached to the benzene ring. But the aromatic protons would be a multiplet, not a singlet. So if D were toluene, it wouldn't have two singlets. Alternatively, if D is something else, like an alkane, but that's not likely.

Wait, another possibility: If D is cyclopropane, but I don't see how propyne would form cyclopropane.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propene, which has an NMR signal for the CH2 group and the CH3 group. Propene's structure is CH2=CHCH3. The CH2=CH group would have protons that are near each other, possibly as a doublet, and the CH3 group would be a triplet. So two different signals, but not two singlets. So option C, which says D gives two singlets, would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if D is something like ethane (unlikely), then its NMR would be a singlet, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps D is an aromatic compound. Let's say D is toluene. Then, the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 attached to benzene, and the aromatic protons would be a multiplet. So two singlets? No, because the aromatic protons wouldn't be a singlet.

Wait, perhaps D is something else. Maybe D is benzene, but then its NMR would have no peaks since all protons are gone. So that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the options again.

Option C claims that D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is something like ethane (unlikely), then yes, but that's not the case. Alternatively, if D is a compound with two equivalent sets of protons, each as singlets.

Wait, if D is a compound like 1,4-dichlorobutane, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, if D is a mono-substituted benzene, like toluene, then the singlet would be for the CH3 group, and the aromatic protons would be a multiplet. So only one singlet, so option C would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if D is a compound with two types of equivalent protons, each as singlets. For example, something like 1,3-dichloropropane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that D is a di-substituted alkene. For example, if D is 1,2-dichloroethene or something, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's try to figure out what each compound is.

After C is propyne, D is formed by passing through red-hot iron. Let's assume that D is benzene. Then:

D (benzene) + H2SO4 and HNO3 → E (nitrobenzene)

E (nitrobenzene) + Fe and HCl → F (phenylamine, aniline)

F (aniline) + HNO2 → G (diazonium chloride)

G (diazonium chloride) + NaOH → H (phenol)

So H is phenol. Phenol reacts with FeCl3 to give a brown color, not yellow. So option B, which says H gives yellow, would be incorrect.

But wait, let's see the options again. Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. If H is phenol, it gives brown, so option B is incorrect. So the incorrect statement is option B.

But let me check what each option says.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

If H is phenol, it gives a brown color, so option B is incorrect. So the incorrect statement is option B.

Wait, but what if H is something else? Let me retrace.

If D is benzene, then E is nitrobenzene, F is aniline, G is the diazonium salt, and H is phenol. So yes, phenol's reaction with FeCl3 is brown, not yellow. So option B is incorrect.

Now, looking at the options:

The question is to identify the incorrect statement about the products.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is aniline, which is indeed used in dye synthesis. So A is correct.

Option B: H gives yellow with FeCl3 → incorrect, as phenol gives brown.

Option C: D gives two singlets in NMR → if D is benzene, no protons, so no peaks. But perhaps D is toluene. In that case, toluene has a singlet for the CH3 group and a multiplet for the aromatic protons. So only one singlet. So option C says two singlets, which would be incorrect. Wait, but this depends on D's structure.

Wait, earlier I thought D might be benzene, but that may lead to option C being incorrect if D is benzene (no protons), or if D is toluene (only one singlet). So if option C is claiming two singlets, it would be incorrect.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to figure out which option is incorrect.

If the answer is option B because H is phenol and gives a brown color, then option B is incorrect.

Alternatively, if D is something else that gives two singlets, then option C would be correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about D's structure. Let me re-examine the steps.

If compound C is propyne (HC≡CCH3), and when passed through red-hot iron, perhaps it forms 1,3-butadiene. How? Because sometimes, heating an alkyne can cause it to dimerize or polymerize. Wait, propyne is HC≡C-CH3; dimerizing would give something like HC≡C-CH2-CH2-C≡CH, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is being converted into a trans-alkene. But without a catalyst, I'm not sure.

Another thought: Maybe the alkyne is being deprotonated and then something else happens.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone. But that usually requires a catalyst like HgSO4 in H2SO4. Without that, I don't think that's the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on D. Let me think about what options suggest.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. So D must have two sets of equivalent protons, each as singlets. For example, something like 1,4-dimethylbenzene (para-xylene) would have two singlets: one for the two methyl groups on the ring, each as a singlet. Wait, no, in para-xylene, the two methyl groups are equivalent, so their protons would form a singlet. The aromatic protons would form another pattern, perhaps a quartet or something else. So that would give two singlets. Alternatively, D could be something like 1,2-dichloroethane, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, D might be 1,3-dichloropropane, but I'm not sure how that would form.

Wait, another possibility: If D is toluene, then the CH3 group is a singlet, and the aromatic protons are a multiplet. So only one singlet. So option C would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if D is something like 1,4-dichlorobutane, which has two sets of equivalent CH2 groups, each as a quartet or something, but not singlets.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me try to think about each option.

The question is about the incorrect statement.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. If H is phenol, it gives brown, making B incorrect.

But I'm not entirely confident about the structure of D. Another possibility is that D is toluene, which when nitrated becomes nitrotoluene, then reduced to toluene amine, then treated with nitrous acid to form benzene-1,2-diol or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is toluene. Then, E would be nitrotoluene. F would be toluenamine. Then, when F is treated with nitrous acid (HNO2), it forms a diazonium salt. Then, when treated with NaOH, it undergoes hydrolysis to form benzoic acid (if it's a meta director) or perhaps another product.

Wait, if F is toluenamine (toluidine), upon treatment with nitrous acid and then NaOH, it would form benzoic acid. Benzoic acid would have a carbonyl group and a benzene ring.

Then, H would be benzoic acid. When benzoic acid reacts with FeCl3, it doesn't give a color because it's a carboxylic acid, not a phenol. So option B, which says H gives yellow, would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if H is benzoic acid, FeCl3 wouldn't react, so no color change. So option B's statement would be incorrect.

But I'm not certain about this pathway either.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about D. Let me think again. Maybe D is benzene, leading to H being phenol, which gives brown with FeCl3. So option B is incorrect.

In any case, the options suggest that the incorrect statement is either B or C.

If I have to choose, based on the steps I've thought through, the incorrect statement is option B, as phenol gives a brown color, not yellow.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂BrCHBrCH₃) as Compound B. Treatment of B with alcoholic KOH leads to the elimination of two HBr molecules, resulting in the formation of propyne (HC≡CCH₃) as Compound C.

When propyne (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes a reaction to form Compound D. While the exact structure of D is unclear, it is assumed to be benzene (C₆H₆) based on the subsequent reactions. Benzene undergoes nitration with a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids to form nitrobenzene (C₆H₅NO₂) as Compound E. Reduction of E with Fe and HCl produces aniline (C₆H₅NH₂) as Compound F. Reaction of F with nitrous acid (HNO₂) forms a diazonium salt (C₆H₅N₂⁺Cl⁻), which upon treatment with NaOH yields phenol (C₆H₅OH) as Compound H.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.  
   F is aniline, which is indeed used in the synthesis of dyes. This statement is correct.

2. **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.  
   H is phenol, which reacts with ferric chloride to give a brown color, not yellow. This statement is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra.  
   If D is benzene (C₆H₆), it has no protons and would not produce any signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum. This statement is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: C is a flammable gas.  
   C is propyne (HC≡CCH₃), which is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.

### Conclusion:
The incorrect statement is **Option B**, as phenol (H) gives a brown color, not yellow, with ferric chloride. While Option C is also incorrect based on the assumption that D is benzene, the question asks for the single incorrect statement, and Option B is more clearly incorrect.

Answer: B
