Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, I remember that electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Let me think about what I know.

The question is about a state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. So, it's a two-step process. I need to figure out the possible intermediate states and the probabilities involved.

First, I recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen. The selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but more importantly for this problem, the angular momentum selection rules. The rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So, n=3, l=0 (which is an s-orbital), and m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so same l and m, but n=1. Since the transition is via two dipole steps, I need to find an intermediate state that goes from 3→2 or perhaps 3→1? But wait, each step must follow the selection rules. So, the first transition must go from n=3 to either n=2 or n=4, but wait, since the final state is n=1, maybe the first step is 3→2, and the second step is 2→1.

Wait, but the options suggest that the two steps are from 3→2 and then 2→1, perhaps. Let me think about the possible intermediate states.

For the first transition from n=3, l=0 (s orbital), to a state that must have l=1 because Δl=±1. So the intermediate state after the first transition would have l=1, which is a p orbital. So the possible states for the first step are |2,1,m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Now, the second transition must go from that state to |1,0,0⟩. So starting from a |2,1,m⟩ state, what are the possible transitions? The final state is l=0, so Δl must be -1 from
