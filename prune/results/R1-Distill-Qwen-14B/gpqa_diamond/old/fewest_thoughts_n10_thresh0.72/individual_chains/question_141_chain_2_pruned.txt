Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see, the question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products will form. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

First, I should probably sketch the structure of the starting material. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, benzene-2-d might be benzene-2-dide or something else? Wait, d is a suffix sometimes used for deuterium. Oh right, in benzene, substituents are numbered. So benzene-2-d would have a deuterium at position 2. But wait, the compound is 1-bromo-2-d. So position 1 is Br, and position 2 is deuterium.

Wait, no, I think the structure is benzene with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So the numbering goes: Br at carbon 1, D at carbon 2.

So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium adjacent. So the structure is like that. Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution.

Wait, benzene is usually pretty stable, but with substituents, the acidity of certain protons changes. So in this case, the deuterium is adjacent to the bromine. Maybe deuterium is on the ortho position relative to Br.

Wait, the reaction is between 1-bromobenzene-2-d and NaNH2 in ammonia. Hmm. What kind of reaction conditions are these? NaNH2 is a strong base, but in condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent. Wait, or is it a solution where ammonia is acting as a base and solvent?

Alternatively, NaNH2 is a strong base, and the reaction might involve elimination or deprotonation. Let me think about possible reactions.

Bromobenzene is a benzene ring with a Br substituent. Br is a meta-directing group. The molecule here is 1-bromo-2-d, so the Br is at position 1, and D is at position 2.

When NaNH2 is used with aromatic compounds, especially substituted ones, it can cause elimination if there's a possibility. For example, in the case of benzyl halides, elimination can
