Okay, so I have this question about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis, right? Metathesis breaks and reforms double bonds, so it's like swapping the ends.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, so it's an alkene with a methyl group on the third carbon. The structure would be CH₂CH₂C(CH3)CH₂CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Pent-1-ene has the double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, wait. Wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. But it's 3-methyl, so on the third carbon. So the structure should be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)(something). Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 carbons. Oh wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would have a CH3 branch on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, that can't be right because pent has five carbons. Wait, maybe carbon 3 is the third one, so CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me write it as CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene: C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2,
