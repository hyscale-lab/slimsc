Okay, so I've got this question about angular momentum operators and eigenvalues. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I should probably write down what S looks like. Wait, S is a 2x2 matrix, so:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Right. And c is h/(4π). So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by this S matrix.

The question is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me recall, eigenvalues a satisfy Ay φ = a φ. So, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Wait, but since Ay is a multiple of S, maybe I can find the eigenvalues of S first and then scale them by c. That would make things easier. Because if S has eigenvalues λ, then Ay = c S would have eigenvalues c λ.

So first, find the eigenvalues of S. The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix, right? Because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Wait, S here looks a lot like the Pauli Y matrix. Oh yeah, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±ℏ/2, but wait, no. Wait, for the Pauli matrices, each has eigenvalues ±1, because when you compute their trace, it's zero, and determinant is -1, so the eigenvalues are 1 and -1, but scaled appropriately.

Wait, Pauli matrices are dimensionless, but in quantum mechanics, when we use them as spin matrices, they are multiplied by ħ/2. Oh, right. So for example, the spin operator S_i is (ħ/2) σ_i. So each Pauli matrix σ has eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become ± ħ/2.

But in our case, the operator is Ay = c * S, where c is h/(4π). Hmm, h is Planck's constant, so h = 2π ħ. So substituting that, c = (2π ħ)/(4 π) )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2.

Wait, because h = 2πħ, so h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

And since S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) * (1) and (ħ/2) * (-1), so ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the options don't seem to mention ħ. Let me check the options again.

Option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ± h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because if the eigenvalues are real, then the imaginary part would be zero. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, in the question, the operator is Ay, which is a spin component. Spin operators in quantum mechanics have real eigenvalues for their eigenstates. So if Ay has real eigenvalues, then the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues would be zero. But looking at the options, all of them have non-zero imaginary parts except maybe none. Wait, let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A) Im: ±2πh, Re: ±h/4π. That would mean complex eigenvalues, which can't be because spin operators have real eigenvalues.

B) Im: ±1/2, Re: ±1. Again, this suggests complex eigenvalues, which can't be right.

C) Correct statement about eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of A² and not Az.

D) Eigenfunctions are basis functions of Ay.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake. Because in the question, the matrix S is given, but the operator is Ay = c·S. So, perhaps S is not the Pauli Y matrix, but scaled differently. Let me compute S's eigenvalues.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is indeed [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. So the eigenvalues of S are ±1, since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1.

So for Ay = c S, c is h/(4π), which is (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So eigenvalues of Ay are (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ± ħ/2.

But wait, ħ is h/(2π). So ħ = h/(2π). Let me substitute that.

So, ħ/2 = (h/(2π)) /2 = h/(4π).

Wait, wait a second. Wait, c = h/(4π), because c = h/(4π). And S has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, Ay's eigenvalues are c * (±1) = ± h/(4π). So a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues are real and of magnitude h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So their real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4pi), and the imaginary parts are zero.

Looking at the options, none of the options A or B say that. Let's look again.

Option A: Im parts are ±2πh, Re parts ±h/4π. So imaginary parts are huge, which can't be right because eigenvalues should be real.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, Re parts ±1. So they have complex eigenvalues. That's impossible for a Hermitian operator, which Ay must be because it's an angular momentum component. Since angular momentum operators are Hermitian, their eigenvalues must be real. So options A and B can't be correct, as they suggest complex eigenvalues.

So options C and D are the possibilities.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm.

Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum. Since Ay is part of the angular momentum, the eigenfunctions of any component of angular momentum are eigenfunctions of A². Because angular momentum components commute with A². So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it is also an eigenfunction of A².

But what about Az? The components of angular momentum don't commute with each other. So, it's not possible for a state to be an eigenfunction of both Ay and Az.

So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it cannot be an eigenfunction of Az. So option C says that, which is correct.

Wait, option C says, "The eigenfunction φ of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az." So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure. Basis functions usually refer to the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions form a basis. So, in the eigenbasis, Ay is diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for Ay. Hmm, maybe that's correct, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, maybe option C is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

The options are whether which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, the question is about the process of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So which of the statements is correct.

The options are about the nature of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

Given that the eigenvalues of Ay are real and ±h/(4π), so the imaginary parts are zero.

Looking at the options, A and B are about the eigenvalues, but their Im parts are non-zero. So they can't be correct.

So, between C and D.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions of Ay form an orthonormal basis, and in that basis, Ay is diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator Ay. So D might be correct.

But wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The question says, "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So, the matrix representation of Ay in the eigenbasis is diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions for the operator in that basis.

So both C and D could be correct?

Wait, let's look again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, yes, because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but can both C and D be correct? The question is a multiple-choice, so likely only one is correct.

Wait, let me re-express. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So when we calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement would be considered correct.

So, in the process, you would find that the eigenfunctions are the basis for Ay's matrix representation, so D is correct. Also, you would note that these eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az, making C correct.

But in the options, only one is correct. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me think about the possible answers again.

In the problem statement, the question is which statement below is correct during the calculation.

So, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

But the matrix operator is given as Ay = c * S, and S is a specific 2x2 matrix. The eigenfunctions are the basis in which Ay is diagonal. So when you diagonalize a matrix, you change the basis to the eigenvectors, making the matrix diagonal in that basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the matrix in its diagonal form. So D is correct.

But wait, the matrix is given in some basis. Its eigenfunctions are the basis in which it's diagonal. So D is correct.

But then, why is option C correct?

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So, since A² is the square of angular momentum, which is a Casimir operator, it commutes with Ay. Therefore, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So C is correct.

Hmm, but the options are multiple-choice, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the eigenvalues. Let me compute Ay's eigenvalues explicitly.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) times S.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

To find the eigenvalues, compute the characteristic equation:

det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Which is:

| (-a)       (h/(4π))*(-i)   |
| (h/(4π))*i   (-a)        |  = 0.

So determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - [ (h/(4π)) * (-i) * (h/(4π)) i ) ]

= a² - [ (h/(4π))^2 * (-i^2) ]

But i^2 = -1, so (-i^2) = 1.

So determinant is a² - (h/(4π))^2 * 1 = 0.

So a² = (h/(4π))².

So a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real: ± h/(4π).

So the real parts are ±h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So the eigenvalues are real.

So now, looking at the options, options A and B suggest complex eigenvalues, which can't be correct. So the correct statements must be either C or D.

So, option C states that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So this statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Which would be correct because in the eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal. So yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator.

So now, which of these is correct?

The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you would find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (D) and that they can be eigenfunctions of A² (C).

But the options are separate. So both C and D could be correct, but perhaps only one is.

Wait, let me re-express the options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct because [A², Ay] = 0, but [Ay, Az] ≠ 0.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay's matrix. That's correct because in the eigenbasis, Ay is diagonal, so the eigenfunctions form the basis.

So both C and D would be correct statements.

But the options are given as choices, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait the question is: which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation.

So, for example, when you calculate the eigenvalue equation, you find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (D) and that they are eigenfunctions of A² (C).

But the options are separate. So both statements C and D might be correct.

But looking at the options, let me read each one carefully.

Option C: The eigenfunction φ of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Correct.

So both statements C and D are correct.

But the options are presented as A, B, C, D, and it's a multiple-choice question, which probably only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, in the question, the matrix operator is given as Ay = c·S. So S is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenfunctions are orthogonal vectors that form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So when you diagonalize the matrix, you express it in the eigenbasis, making the matrix diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions in that diagonal representation.

So, yes, option D is correct. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that statement D is correct only if the eigenfunctions form the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. That's exactly what happens. So, during the calculation, you'd find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for Ay's matrix, which is option D.

But also, statement C is correct. So why is only one correct?

Wait, the question is about the process of calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, perhaps during the calculation, you'd find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (D), which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is not correct because the basis functions refer to the original basis in which Ay is represented, which is not necessarily the eigenbasis.

Wait, no. The statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the eigenfunctions are the basis in which Ay is diagonal. So option D is correct.

But then how about option C? It's also correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: compute the actual eigenvectors and see.

Let me compute the eigenvectors of Ay.

We have Ay = (h/(4π)) * S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix.

The eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

For the eigenvalue a = h/(4π), we solve (Ay - a I) φ = 0.

So,

Ay - a I = (h/(4π)) * S - (h/(4π)) I.

Which is (h/(4π)) [ S - I ].

So,

[ - (h/(4π))       -i (h/(4π)) ] φ = 0
[ i (h/(4π))        - (h/(4π)) ]

Divide both sides by (h/(4π)),

[ -1       -i ] [ φ1 ] = 0
[ i       -1 ] [ φ2 ]

So,

- φ1 - i φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for a = -h/(4π), the eigenvector would be proportional to [ i, 1 ]^T.

So, the eigenfunctions are any scalar multiples of these vectors.

So, what about option C: eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A².

A² is the square of the angular momentum. For spin-1/2 particles, A² = (ℏ/2)^2 I, where I is the identity matrix. Because for any Pauli matrix σ_i, σ_i^2 = I. So S^2 = I, so Ay^2 = (c S)^2 = c^2 S^2 = c^2 I.

Wait, but A² is the square of the angular momentum. Wait, the angular momentum operator is A = (ℏ/2) S, but in this case, Ay is (ℏ/2) S_y, but wait no.

Wait, in the problem, Ay is c·S, where c = h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So, Ay is (ħ/2) S.

So, A² would be (ħ/2)^2 S^2.

Since S is the Pauli Y matrix, S² = I. So A² = (ħ²/4) I. So the eigenfunctions of A² are any vectors, because A² is a multiple of the identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue (ħ²/4).

Thus, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A², which confirms option C.

So, option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, since the matrix is given in the standard basis (probably computational basis), but its eigenfunctions form a different basis. So when you express the matrix in the eigenbasis, it's diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions in that eigenbasis.

So, during the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions form a basis for Ay's operator. So D is also correct.

Wait, but in the given problem, the matrix S is already given. When you find its eigenfunctions, those are the basis in which the S matrix is diagonal. So, in that basis, Ay is diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So, both statements C and D are correct.

But wait, the options are only A, B, C, D, and the question is which statement is correct.

Looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the Y-component operator Ay, which is a 2x2 matrix. The calculation is about eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, when you calculate the eigenvalues, you find they are real (so A and B are wrong), and when you calculate the eigenvectors, you find that they form a basis (so D is correct) and that they are eigenfunctions of A² (so C is correct).

But perhaps only one of these is an option.

Looking back, the possible correct statements are C and D.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct, because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A². But since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which would be correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis in which Ay is diagonal.

So both C and D are correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as four choices, each a statement. So the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Or, perhaps it's C.

Wait, let me think about statement D. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So, the matrix is given in a particular basis; the eigenfunctions form a different basis. So, when you express Ay in that basis, it's diagonal. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions in which Ay is diagonal. Therefore, D is correct.

But the question is about the process of calculation. So during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's matrix.

So, perhaps both C and D are correct, but in the given options, only one of them is. Since the question asks which statement is correct, and the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because it's talking about the properties of the eigenfunctions beyond just being a basis.

Wait, let me look again.

The options:

C) The eigenfunction φ of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Hmm. Both are correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about option C. Since we are dealing with spin-½ particles, the eigenfunctions of Ay are spin-up and spin-down in the y-direction. These are eigenfunctions of A² as well, since A² is the same for all spin states.

But these eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az because they are not aligned along the z-axis.

So option C is correct.

As for option D, the matrix operator Ay has eigenfunctions that form a basis. So yes, D is correct.

But according to the options, only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options present them separately.

But the options are presented as four choices, so perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The matrix operator is given as a 2×2 matrix, so the basis functions are in two dimensions. The eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis, so any vector can be expressed in terms of them. So yes, D is correct.

But I'm stuck between C and D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², which is statement C.

Alternatively, option D is about the basis functions, which is an inherent property of the matrix regardless of the calculation. Hmm, but during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you would find that the eigenfunctions form the basis, so statement D is correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, the question says "during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct".

So, when you solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you find the eigenfunctions, which form a basis for the operator. So you would consider D to be correct.

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C is the correct one.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct answer in the options.

Wait, let's think about what each option says in terms of reality.

In reality:

- The eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² (C is correct), so option C is correct.

- The eigenfunctions of Ay form an orthonormal basis for the space, so D is also correct.

But perhaps in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice question, so perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because when Ay is calculated, you find that its eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², which is correct.

Hmm. I think I'm getting stuck, but I'll go with option C.


The problem involves determining the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \), as \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix.
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - The eigenvalues are real, meaning the imaginary parts are zero. This eliminates options **A** and **B**, as they suggest complex eigenvalues, which are not possible for a Hermitian operator like \( A_y \).

2. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
   - \( A^2 \) is the square of the angular momentum operator and commutes with \( A_y \). Therefore, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes option **C** correct.

3. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis in which \( A_y \) is diagonal. Thus, the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions for \( A_y \). This makes option **D** correct.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options **C** and **D** are correct based on the analysis. However, the question asks which statement is correct *during the calculation*. Option **C** directly relates to the properties of the eigenfunctions (e.g., their relationship to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \)), which would naturally arise during the calculation. Option **D**, while true, is more about the inherent structure of the operator and its representation in a basis, which is a broader property.

### Conclusion:
The most appropriate answer, based on the context of the question, is **C**.

**Answer: C**
