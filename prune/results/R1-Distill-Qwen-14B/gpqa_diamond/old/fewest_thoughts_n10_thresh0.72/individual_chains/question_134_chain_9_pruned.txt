Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to form water and possibly a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base, often measured in kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. There are three solutions here, so I need to figure out all the reactions happening. Let me jot down the possible reactions.

First, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, it's diprotic. So the first H+ will dissociate completely, but the second one may not, but since we're dealing with neutralization, maybe I can treat it similarly to a strong acid for this purpose. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well, so it'll dissociate into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions.

So when these are mixed, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH^- from the base. But wait, wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole gives two OH^- ions. HCl gives one H+ per mole, and H2SO4 gives two H+ per mole (since it's diprotic and both H+ are strong). So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Let me compute each component's moles.

For HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles HCl. Each gives one H+, so 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M. So 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each H2SO4 gives two H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives two OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but wait. The total H+ from the acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- from the base is 0.2 moles. So when they react, the H+ and OH- will combine to form water.

The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O, and this releases heat. The enthalpy change for this is usually
