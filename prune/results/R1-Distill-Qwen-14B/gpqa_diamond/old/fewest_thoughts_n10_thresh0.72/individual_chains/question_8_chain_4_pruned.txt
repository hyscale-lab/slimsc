Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. 

So, the question is about a high-throughput experiment done on white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants—g1, g2, g3—and some double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. 

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are proteins that help turn on other genes. If a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes won't be expressed, right?

The experiment tested the resistance of these mutants to anthracnose. Resistance is measured as a percentage of the control (wild-type). Lower percentages mean more susceptibility. So:

- g1: 75% resistance. That's less than wild type (100%).
- g2: 0% resistance. So the mutant is super susceptible.
- g3: 50% resistance. So halfway between susceptible and resistant.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
  - g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
  - g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Hmm. Let's think about what this means. 

So, the wild type is fully resistant. Each single mutant has varying resistance. g2 is completely susceptible. So whatever g2 does, it's critical for resistance because when it's knocked out, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all.

Now, looking at the double mutants. 

g1g2: 0% resistance. Since both g1 and g2 are knocked out, and the resistance is 0. But wait, the single g2 already had 0%, so adding g1 doesn't change anything. So g1's presence or absence doesn't affect the resistance when g2 is already out. That suggests that g2 is upstream of g1, or that g1's function is redundant when g2 is gone.

Wait, or perhaps g2 is a transcription factor that activates g1. So if g2 is KO, then g1 isn't expressed. But in the single mutant g1, the resistance is 75%—so they have some resistance. So if the double mutant g1g2 is 0%, that might suggest that when both are knocked out, you get the same as g2. So maybe g2 is upstream, and g1 is downstream. Because if g2 is a TF that activates g1, then without g2, g1 can't be expressed. So in the double mutant, you have no g2 and no g1, but in the single mutant g1, you have no g1 but maybe some other factors, or perhaps g2 is the main one.

Wait, but the single g2 mutant has 0% resistance. So perhaps g2 is the main gene, and when it's knocked out, the plant can't resist at all. Then, what about the other genes?

Looking at g3's single mutant: 50% resistance. So it's less resistant than wild type but not completely susceptible. So G3's product probably contributes to resistance but isn't the only factor.

Now, the double mutants. Let's look at g1g3, which is 10% resistance. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. Since each single mutant g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, when both are out, the resistance drops to 10%. So together, they contribute more than individually.

Wait, but that might indicate that G1 and G3 work in parallel pathways. Because when both are knocked out, the resistance drops much lower. Like, if they were in the same pathway, knocking out both might not cause a bigger effect. But if they're in separate pathways, you lose both contributions, so the effect is additive.

Alternatively, if they are in the same pathway, maybe they're redundant. So each can compensate for the other. If both are gone, then the pathway is fully inactive, leading to a more severe phenotype. So in that case, the double mutant would have more severe resistance than either single mutant.

Wait, but for g1 and g3: the single mutants have 75% and 50%, but the double is 10%. So that's a much bigger drop than just adding 75 and 50. Hmm. Maybe they are in the same pathway. Because if G1 is upstream of G3, then knocking out G1 would also affect G3's expression. So in the single g1 mutant,
