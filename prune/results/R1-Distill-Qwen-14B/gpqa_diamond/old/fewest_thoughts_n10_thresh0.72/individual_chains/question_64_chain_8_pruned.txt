Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I need to walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem involves an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air, which probably means it's a decomposition reaction in an inert environment. The result is a mixture of gases.

These gases are then passed through three different tubes. Let's break down what each tube does:

1. Tube №1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can trap water vapor. So when the gases pass through, any water vapor would be absorbed here. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. That suggests that the gases produced water, maybe as steam, which was captured here.

2. Tube №2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution. Calcium hydroxide is used to absorb carbon dioxide. If the weight here didn't change, it means no CO2 was present in the gases. Because if there was CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, increasing the tube's weight. So, no CO2 in the gas mixture.

3. Tube №3 has red-hot copper. The gas passed through here caused CuO to form. I think copper oxide is formed when CO reacts with copper at high temperatures. The reaction is probably 2Cu + CO → 2CuO + C? Or maybe another stoichiometry. Wait, let me think. Oh right, the reaction is 2 Cu (s) + CO(g) → 2 CuO(s) + C (graphite). But wait, I'm not sure about the exact products. Alternatively, another possibility is CO reacting with Cu: CO + Cu → CuO + C. Let me check that. Yeah, that's right—each CO molecule reacts with a Cu atom to form CuO and carbon.

The weight of tube №3 increased by 0.80 grams. So this is the mass of CuO formed. Let's calculate how much CO was present.

First, the mass of CuO formed is 0.80 grams. The molar mass of CuO is 64 (Cu) + 16 (O) = 80 g/mol. So moles of CuO = 0.80 g / 80 g/mol = 0.01 mol. 

From the reaction, each mole of CO produces one mole of CuO. So moles of CO = 0.01 mol. So there was 0.01 mol of CO in the gas mixture.

Moving on, after passing through these tubes, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). STP is 0°C and 1 atm, and 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 mol. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

What is gas C? Let's think about the possible gases. Since we started with salts that decomposed, the gases are likely products of their decomposition. We know CO is present (from tube 3), and water vapor was in the mixture (trapped by tube 1). But the remaining gas is C.

Wait, the initial gases include H2O (trapped as 3.60 g), CO (0.01 mol), and the remaining gas is C (0.1 mol). So the total gases produced were H2O, CO, and C.

But wait, let's think about the gases. Alternatively, maybe the initial gases are more complex. Let me track all the information.

The initial mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the products are gases. So A and B are likely carbonates or sulfites, but wait, Ca(OH)2 didn't react, so no CO2. So maybe they're not carbonates.

Wait, Ca(OH)2 solution would react with CO2 to
