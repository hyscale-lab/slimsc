Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process and the factors that come out of the integrals when calculating loop diagrams.

The expression given is α^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let me break this down. 

I know that α is the fine-structure constant, which is e²/(4πε₀ħc), so it's a dimensionless quantity related to the electromagnetic coupling. g is probably a coupling constant for another interaction, like the strong force. 

When you have loop integrals in Feynman diagrams, each loop contributes a factor of (1/(4πε₀))^n, where n is the number of loops. Wait, no, wait. Or is it that each loop brings a factor of the integral d^4k/(something), which in dimensional regularization might involve 4π and the epsilon parameter. Alternatively, in terms of scaling, each loop might contribute a factor involving (4π)^something in the denominator.

Also, the overall scaling of the amplitude with the energy scale Q is important. The term (Q/M)^2 suggests that Q is an energy scale, perhaps the renormalization scale, and M is another scale, maybe a mass of a particle or a parameter in the theory. But that part might not directly affect the number of loops.

Another approach is to think about the superficial degree of divergence. For a Feynman diagram, the superficial degree of divergence gives an idea of the scaling with the energy scale, but maybe that's complicating things more than needed.

Alternatively, looking at the powers of π in the denominator. The term is (4π)^6. Let me think, each loop in a Feynman diagram, when you perform the integration, typically gives a factor of (4π)^something. For example, in dimensional regularization, after integrating, you might have factors like (4π)^{-d/2} where d is the dimension, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: The overall factor when calculating loop integrals often includes factors like (4π)^L, where L is the number of loops.
