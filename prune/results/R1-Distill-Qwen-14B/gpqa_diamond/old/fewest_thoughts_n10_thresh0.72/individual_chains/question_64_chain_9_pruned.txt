Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the problem carefully.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they decompose to form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes. The results from these tubes are given, and from that, I need to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.

Breaking down the setup: the gases go through three tubes. The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. So, any water vapor in the gas would react with it. So tube 1 probably absorbs water, increasing its weight by 3.60 grams. That means the gases contained water vapor, which was captured here.

Then the gases pass through Ca(OH)2 solution, which is tube 2. But the weight of tube 2 didn't change. Hmm, Ca(OH)2 is a base that would react with acidic gases like CO2. So if the weight didn't change, maybe there was no CO2 in the gases. Or perhaps all the CO2 was somehow not reacting, but that seems unlikely. Wait, but another possibility is that the solution in tube 2 is saturated, so no more CO2 could dissolve. But that's probably not the case here because the problem states it's a solution, so maybe it's just that there's no CO2 in the gases.

The third tube is red-hot copper, which would react with certain gases. Red-hot copper reacts with water vapor to produce CuO and H2 (but wait, no, that's when you have steam and copper under certain conditions. Alternatively, if there's CO or H2, they might react with copper. Wait, no, when CO is passed over hot copper, it can be oxidized. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Red-hot copper in contact with CO might not react much unless it's under certain conditions, but H2 would react with hot copper to form CuO and H2 gas. Or wait, maybe the gas is CO and H2, which upon reaction with hot copper would form CuO and release some gas. Let me think again.

Wait, so the third tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams, and that's CuO formed. So the reaction must have been between some gas and the copper to form CuO. So, which gases could cause that? Let me think about possible reactions.

Copper(II) oxide is formed. So maybe there was some CO or H2 present. For example, if CO is passed over hot copper, does it react? I remember that CO is a reducing agent. So CO + CuO (under heat) → Cu + CO2. But in this case, the copper is in the tube, so perhaps the reaction is CO reacting with Cu to form CuO and some other product?

Wait, another possibility: the gas passing through the copper is H2. H2 will react with CuO to
