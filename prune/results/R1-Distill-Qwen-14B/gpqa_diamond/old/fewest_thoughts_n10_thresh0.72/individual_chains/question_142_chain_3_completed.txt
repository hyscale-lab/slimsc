Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. But I'm a bit rusty on the details, so let me think this through.

The question gives me a specific density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

And asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are vectors in three dimensions, which I think correspond to the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, right! A single qubit can be represented on the Bloch sphere, where the state is a vector (a, b, c) such that a² + b² + c² = 1. But wait, in the case of a pure state, the density matrix is a projector onto a single state. For a mixed state, like this one, it's a convex combination of projectors.

So, what's this ρ matrix look like? Let me write it out. The |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 at (1,1). So when you add them, each diagonal element is 1, and off-diagonal are zero. Then multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal entry becomes 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

Wait, but how does that translate to the Bloch sphere? Oh right, the density matrix for a mixed state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere as well, but the position depends on the state. But wait, this is a completely mixed state, because it's ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). That should correspond to the maximally mixed state, which is the completely depolarized state.

I remember that for a qubit, the maximally mixed state has density matrix (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. So yes, that's exactly what this ρ is. So the Bloch vector for this state should be at the origin, because the density matrix is (I/2), which corresponds to r = (0,0,0). Because when you have a state represented as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, r would be zero for the maximally mixed state.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that's the answer.

Wait, just to be thorough. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. If the density matrix is (I)/2, that means r is zero. So yes, the point is at the origin. So the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This corresponds to the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as the maximally mixed state is centered at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Among the provided options, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the maximally mixed state corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
