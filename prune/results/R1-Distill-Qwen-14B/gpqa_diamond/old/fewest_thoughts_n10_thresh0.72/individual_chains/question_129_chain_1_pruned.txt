Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps and some hints, so I need to break it down.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, which are various cycloketones.

Let me think about each step.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So A is likely a ketone or aldehyde. The IR peak at ~1750 cm^-1 supports that; that's usually a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So A is a ketone.

When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin, which is a geminal diol with a cyano group attached. So the structure of B would have an -OH and -CN group on the same carbon as the carbonyl in A.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation with palladium typically reduces triple bonds or nitriles. Wait, no. Wait, the cyanohydrin has an -OH and -CN on the same carbon. But wait, B is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a CN group adjacent. So when you hydrogenate that, what happens?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Cyanohydrin is an addition product, where the HCN adds to the carbonyl, giving a geminal diol (but it's actually a secondary alcohol and a nitrile). So structure would be something like R-C(OH)(CN)-R'.

If we hydrogenate this, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. Nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would become CH2NH2, but wait, sometimes it's done under different conditions. Wait, no, hydrogenation of nitrile would typically produce an amine, but in presence of Pd, maybe it's a different condition. Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking of LiAlH4 which reduces nitriles to amines. Wait, but with H2 and Pd, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. Cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)(CN). So when B is hydrogenated with H2
