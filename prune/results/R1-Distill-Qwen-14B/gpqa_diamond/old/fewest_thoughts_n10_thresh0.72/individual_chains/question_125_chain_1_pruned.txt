Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it says. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Hmm, right, I remember that an isotropic potential means it's the same in all directions, so this is symmetric in x, y, and z.

The problem asks about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different energy expressions and multiplicities.

I need to recall how the energy levels work in a 3D harmonic oscillator. Oh wait, in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, no, more precisely, the energy is given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), right? Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and adding them up gives the total energy.

Wait, but sometimes it's expressed in terms of the total quantum number N. Because in 3D, each direction is independent, so the energy can be written in terms of the sum of the individual quantum numbers. Alternatively, I think that the energy levels can be grouped by the value of N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each energy level E_N is given by E_N = ħω (N + 3/2), where N is a non-negative integer (0,1,2, ...).

So the ground state is N=0, which gives E= (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be the next possible N, which is N=1, so E= (5/2) ħω. The second excited state would be N=2, E=(7/2) ħω. The third excited state would be N=3, so E=(9/2) ħω. So that's the energy part.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. Since each energy level corresponds to a specific N, the number of eigenfunctions (or the degeneracy) is given by the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers (n_x, n_y, n_z). This is a combinatorial problem, essentially the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N.

The formula for the number of solutions is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1 ) = (N+2 choose 2). So for N=3, that's (3+2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because the third excited state is when N=3, right? Because ground state (N=0) is the first, first excited (N=1), second (N=2), third (N=3) is correct. So the degeneracy is 10, so the eigenfunctions are 10 in number.

Looking back at the options, option A says energy (9/2)
