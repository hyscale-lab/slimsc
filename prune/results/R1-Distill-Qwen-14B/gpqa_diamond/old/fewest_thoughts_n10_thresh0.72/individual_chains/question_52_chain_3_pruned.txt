Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—meaning when there are no spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we can assume the photosphere is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So, let's break this down. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors), E1 and E2 are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question is about how this ratio changes when the star has spots versus no spots. So initially, without spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K. When spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. But wait, wait—do the spots themselves change the effective temperature, or is the Teff of the spotted areas different?

Oh wait, I think that when stars have spots, the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the star's overall effective temperature is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. But in this problem, the overall Teff when spots are present is given as 5500 K. So the photosphere as a whole has a lower effective temperature. So for the purposes of the photosphere, when considering the entire star, the temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise.

But wait, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the star's overall emission is lower because a significant part of its surface is cooler.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels. Since the photosphere is in LTE, the temperature of each region (spot or non-spot) would determine the level populations there. But wait, when we observe the star as a whole, the spectrum is a combination of the individual regions. But since the problem states that the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K when spots are present, perhaps we can model the entire photosphere at 5500 K when spots are there, and 6000 K otherwise.

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Because the spots themselves are cooler regions—so the effective temperature
