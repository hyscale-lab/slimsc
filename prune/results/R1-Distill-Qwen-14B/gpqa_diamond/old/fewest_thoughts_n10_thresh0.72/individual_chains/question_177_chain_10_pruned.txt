Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. Interesting. Now, the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the wavelength where they emit most brightly (peak wavelength) depends on their temperature, right? Oh yeah, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, that means their temperatures are the same. Because λ_max * T = constant. So T1 equals T2.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars radiate as black bodies, this formula applies. Here, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Oh, but wait, the problem states that T is the same for both stars because λ_max is the same.

So, the luminosity depends on R squared and T to the fourth power. Since T is the same, L is proportional to R squared. Let me compute the ratio of L1 to L2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, (R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So, L1/L2 should be 2.25. But wait, the options don't have exactly 2.25 as the right answer, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, right, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the question is about the actual luminosity, not the observed. So maybe the radial velocity doesn't directly affect the luminosity calculation, because luminosity is an intrinsic property. Hmm. So the velocities given are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Oh, but the peak wavelengths were determined through spectroscopy. So when they measure the wavelength, it's the observed wavelength. If a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts (Doppler shift). 

Wait a second! Did I miss that? Because if the stars have different radial velocities, their observed wavelengths might differ, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the problem says that the wavelengths are the same. So even though their actual temperatures are the same, the Doppler effect could shift their observed peak wavelengths. But the problem says that the wavelengths are the same. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift. The observed wavelength is the same as the
