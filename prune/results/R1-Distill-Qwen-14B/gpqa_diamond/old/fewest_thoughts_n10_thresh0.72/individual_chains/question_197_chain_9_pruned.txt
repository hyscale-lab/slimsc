Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data and then predicting the product after a reaction. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the question says Compound X has certain IR and NMR data. Then it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the product is from the options given.

Let me start by looking at the spectroscopic data. The IR has peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H. But more likely O-H because of the range. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound likely has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: the peaks are at 10.5 ppm (a broad singlet, 1H). That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because aldehyde protons are around 9-10, but they are usually sharp, and in carboxylic acids, the protons exchange and give a broad peak. Then there's a triplet around 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and another at 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So the substituents are opposite each other on the benzene, leading to two sets of equivalent protons.

The NMR also shows a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet integrating for one proton. That could be a CH group adjacent to something, maybe next to a carbonyl. Then at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), another multiplet for two protons. And 1.4 ppm as a doublet (3H), which is likely a methyl group attached to something. Finally, 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), probably a terminal CH2 in an ethyl group.

Putting this together: the compound has a benzene ring with a para substituent that's a carbonyl group (from the IR and the 10.5 ppm peak in NMR). The substituent is probably a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl; carboxylic acids have a C=O around 1700, but sometimes a bit lower. Also, if it's a carboxylic acid, the NMR would have a broad peak for the -OH proton. Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which fits a carboxylic acid. So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

The benzene has substituents at the para positions. One substituent is the carbonyl group (maybe COOH or COOR). The other substituent is a chain. Let's see: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H)—maybe a CH2CH3 group. A triplet suggests that the CH2 is next to another CH2, but wait, the triplet is for 3H, which is a CH2CH3. Then at 1.4 ppm, a doublet of 3H—maybe a CH(CH3), but as a doublet? Or perhaps a methyl group attached to a CH2. Wait, let's think: if you have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the other protons: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7
