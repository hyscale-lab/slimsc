Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde and ending up with product 3. I need to find out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember each reaction's outcome.

First reaction: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide. I think that's a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents typically add to carbonyl groups. So, cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde, right? The structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde is CH₂=CH-C(O)H, but wait, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is actually an aromatic aldehyde. Let me think: it's benzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached. The structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO, but wait, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, maybe it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO. No, wait, I think I'm mixing it up. Cinnamaldehyde is actually an aromatic compound with a propenal group. Oh right, the structure is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached to the aldehyde. So it's Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Let me get this right. Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal-1. So its structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, maybe Ph-CH₂-CHO is benzaldehyde with a methyl group, but wait, no. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde where the carbonyl is attached to a double bond. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, I think it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO is something else. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the formula is C₉H₈O. The structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No. Wait, no. Actually, the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Oh, wait, I think I'm confusing cinnamic acid with cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde
