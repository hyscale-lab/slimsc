Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.

Alright, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I guess is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12.

Wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO₄³- right? So I need to find [PO₄³-] in the solution.

I remember that when you have a solution containing both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄, it's a buffer solution because they are a weak acid and its conjugate base. Oh wait, actually, KH₂PO₄ is the acid (H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 is the conjugate base (HPO4^2-). But wait, HPO4^2- can act as a base because it can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-, or donate a proton to become PO4^3-.

Wait, so the phosphate buffer system is H3PO4 ⇌ H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3-. But in solution, when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they can form a buffer. But I'm supposed to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, maybe I should think about the equilibrium here. Since PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-, which is itself a base. Hmm.

Wait, when you have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, the dominant species might be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because of their respective pKa values. Let me think about the pKa values.

Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 = log(1/(7.5e-3)) ≈ 2.12. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, pKa2 ≈ 7.21. Ka3 is 1.8e-12, pKa3 ≈ 11.74.

So the solution is probably at pH around where the second ionization is relevant. Wait, but the buffer we're making here is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because they have a pKa of around 7.21. So in this buffer, the pH is determined by that pKa. But the problem is to find the concentration of PO4^3-, which would be the product of the third deprotonation.

Wait, but in the buffer solution, the HPO4^2- can deprotonate to form PO4^3- according to the third ionization. But the Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low.

So, perhaps I can model this as a buffer solution where the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The buffer equation would be based on their concentrations and the second pKa. But the PO4^3- comes from the third deprotonation. So maybe I can find the concentration of HPO4^2- first, and then consider the third ionization.

Wait, but maybe the solution is more complicated because both the second and third ionizations are present. Alternatively, perhaps I should model each step.

Alternatively, since the solution contains both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO4·2H2O, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively, perhaps the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, in that case, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be determined. Then, from HPO4^2- I can find PO4^3- via the third ionization.

So here's the plan:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt in the solution.

2. Find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

3. Use the buffer equation to find the pH of the solution.

4. Then, find the concentration of PO4^3- from the third ionization, using the concentration of HPO4^2- and the Ka3.

But wait, maybe there's a better approach. The solution must be a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by their pKa2. Then, at that pH, I can calculate the concentrations of the species at each dissociation step.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the moles of each component.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005612 mol.

Wait, I need to make sure about the formula. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So each mole of this salt provides one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 is 0.007345 mol, and the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.005612 mol.

Wait, but wait: KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, [H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005612 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02806 M.

So now, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]) where A- is HPO4^2- and HA is H2PO4^-.

So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

Wait, wait, no. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log (0.02806 / 0.036725) 

Let me compute that ratio: 0.02806 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.7647.

log(0.7647) ≈ -0.113.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.113 ≈ 7.095.

So the pH is approximately 7.095.

Now, I need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74.

Wait, but the pH is 7.1, which is lower than pKa3. Hmm, so in this scenario, the solution is acidic relative to pKa3. So the deprotonation of HPO4^2- to PO4^3- would be less favored. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be low.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the third ionization:

pH = pKa3 + log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-])

Rearranged: [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] × 10^(pH - pKa3)

So, plug in the numbers:

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M.

pH is 7.095, pKa3 is 11.74.

So 7.095 - 11.74 = -4.645.

10^(-4.645) ≈ 2.3e-5.

So [PO4^3-] = 0.02806 * 2.3e-5 ≈ 6.45e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, that's 6.45e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. Hmm, so my calculation gives about 6.45e-7, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7). But wait, maybe I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the exact values. Maybe I approximated too much.

Wait, let me recalculate the pH more accurately.

The ratio was 0.02806 / 0.036725 = let me compute that more precisely.

0.02806 / 0.036725 = (2806 / 36725) → let's compute that.

2806 ÷ 36725 ≈ 0.07646? Wait, no. Wait, 0.02806 / 0.036725 is (28.06/36.725) → since 28.06 is less than 36.725, so it's 0.7647, as I had before.

Wait, 36.725 multiplied by 0.7647 is 28.06? Let me check:

36.725 * 0.7647 ≈ 36.725 * 0.7 = 25.7075, 36.725 * 0.0647 ≈ 2.386. So total 28.0935. Close enough.

So the log of 0.7647 is indeed approximately -0.113.

So pH is 7.208 - 0.113 = 7.095.

Now, [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * 10^(pH - pKa3).

Wait, 10^(7.095 - 11.74) = 10^(-4.645) ≈ ?

Let me compute 10^(-4.645):

10^(-4) is 1e-4=0.0001.

10^(-0.645) is approximately 0.229 (since 10^(-0.699)=0.2, 10^(-0.645)= roughly 0.229).

So 10^(-4.645)=1e-4 * 0.229 = 2.29e-5.

So [PO4^3-] = 0.02806 M * 2.29e-5 ≈ (0.02806 * 2.29e-5) = approximately 6.42e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.42e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A)6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, C)2.81e-7, D)3.97e-7.

So the closest is A) 6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in some step. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value with more precise numbers.

Let me compute the exact ratio for the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol = 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005612 mol.

Concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005612 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → let me compute that precisely.

6.2e-8 → log(6.2) is 0.7924, so 0.7924 -8 → pKa2 is 7.2076.

Wait, wait, no: pKa = -log(Ka). So for Ka2=6.2e-8, pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.2076.

Then, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02806 / 0.036725 = 0.7647.

log(0.7647) = let's compute it more accurately.

We know that log(0.75)= -0.1249, and log(0.7647) is a bit higher than that.

Using linear approximation between 0.75 and 0.77.

log(0.75) = -0.1249.

log(0.76) ≈ let me think: 10^-0.12 = approx 0.758, so 0.758 is log(0.758)= -0.12.

Wait, better to compute log(0.7647) precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps using natural logarithm and then converting.

But perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like method.

We can compute log(0.7647) as:

We know that log(7.647e-1) = log(7.647) -1.

log(7.647) is approx 0.8844 (since log(7)=0.8451, log(7.6)=0.8808, log(7.647)= approx 0.8844).

So log(0.7647)= 0.8844 -1 = -0.1156.

Wait, wait, no. Because 7.647 is 7.647, so 7.647e-1 is 0.7647.

Wait, no, actually, 7.647e-1 is 0.7647.

So log(0.7647) = log(7.647e-1) = log(7.647) -1.

log(7.647) is about 0.8844.

So 0.8844 -1 = -0.1156.

Earlier, I thought it was about -0.113. So perhaps I should use more precise numbers.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.1156) = 7.2076 -0.1156 = 7.092.

Now, compute [PO4^3-].

HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 → pKa3 = 11.74.

The equation is pH = pKa3 + log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]).

Rearranged: [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * 10^(pH - pKa3).

pH - pKa3 = 7.092 - 11.74 = -4.648.

10^(-4.648) = ?

We can compute 10^(-4.648) as 10^(-4) * 10^(-0.648).

10^(-4)=1e-4.

10^(-0.648) ≈ ?

We know that 10^(-0.69897)=0.2 (since log(5)=0.69897, so 10^(-0.69897)=1/5=0.2).

So 10^(-0.648) is a bit larger than 0.2.

Let me compute 10^(-0.648):

Let me use logarithm tables or linear approximation.

We can think that 10^(-0.648) = 1/(10^0.648).

Compute 10^0.648.

We know that 10^0.6 ≈3.98, 10^0.7≈5.01.

Wait, 0.648 is between 0.6 and 0.7.

Let me compute 0.648 = 0.6 + 0.048.

So 10^0.6 is about 3.981.

We can use the approximation that 10^x ≈ 10^a * (1 + (x-a)*ln(10)) for small (x-a).

So a=0.6, x=0.648.

So 10^0.648 ≈ 3.981 * (1 + (0.048) * ln(10)).

ln(10)=2.3026.

So 0.048 * 2.3026 ≈0.1105.

So 3.981 * (1.1105) ≈3.981 * 1.1105.

Let me compute that:

3.981 * 1 =3.981.

3.981 * 0.1105 = approx 0.439.

So total ≈4.420.

So 10^0.648 ≈4.420 → 10^(-0.648) ≈1/4.420 ≈0.2263.

So 10^(-4.648) = 1e-4 * 0.2263 ≈2.263e-5.

So [PO4^3-] = 0.02806 M * 2.263e-5 ≈ (0.02806 * 2.263e-5) = let me compute that.

0.02806 * 2.263e-5.

Multiply 0.02806 by 2.263e-5.

First, 0.02806 * 2.263 = ?

0.02806 *2=0.05612.

0.02806 *0.263= approximately 0.00738.

Total ≈0.05612 +0.00738=0.0635.

But wait, actually, 2.263 is 2 + 0.263.

So 0.02806 *2=0.05612; 0.02806 *0.263: let's compute 0.02806 *0.2=0.005612; 0.02806*0.063= approximately 0.00177.

So 0.005612+0.00177=0.007382.

Total 0.05612 +0.007382=0.063502.

Wait, but we're multiplying 0.02806 *2.263e-5 → which is 0.02806 * (2.263 *1e-5) = (0.02806 *2.263) * 1e-5.

So 0.02806 *2.263 ≈0.063502.

So 0.063502e-5 =6.3502e-7 M.

So [PO4^3-] ≈6.35e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps I made an approximation error somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can compute [PO4^3-] using the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the presence of HPO4^2- can also react with water in another way, but I think I've considered all steps.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is correct, and the calculation is correct.

So the concentration is about 6.35e-7 M, which is near option A (6.24e-7) but not exactly matching.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio.

Wait, let me recalculate the log(0.7647) more accurately.

0.7647 is 7.647e-1.

log(7.647) → let's compute it precisely.

We know that log(7) = 0.8451, log(7.6)=0.8808, log(7.647) is approximately 0.884.

Because 7.647 is 7.6 + 0.047.

Compute between log(7.6) = 0.8808 and log(7.647).

The difference from 7.6 to 7.647 is 0.047 in x, and the change in log(x) can be approximated by the derivative.

The derivative of log(x) is 1/(x ln10). At x=7.6, ln(7.6)= approx 2.028.

So 1/(7.6 * 2.028) ≈1/(15.42) ≈0.0649 per unit x.

So for 0.047 increase in x, the increase in log(x) is 0.047 *0.0649 ≈0.003.

So log(7.647) ≈0.8808 + 0.003= 0.8838.

Thus, log(0.7647) = log(7.647e-1) = 0.8838 -1 = -0.1162.

So pH = pKa2 + log(ratio) → 7.2076 + (-0.1162)=7.0914.

So pH is approximately 7.0914.

Then, pH - pKa3 =7.0914 -11.74= -4.6486.

Compute 10^(-4.6486) → same as before, around 2.26e-5.

So [PO4^3-] = 0.02806 * 2.26e-5.

0.02806 *2.26e-5 = (0.02806 * 2.26) * 1e-5.

Compute 0.02806 *2.26:

0.02806 *2=0.05612.

0.02806*0.26=0.0072956.

Total is 0.05612+0.0072956=0.063415.

So 0.063415e-5 =6.3415e-7 M.

Hmm, so about 6.34e-7 M.

Which is about 6.34e-7 M. The options are A:6.24e-7, B:5.48e-7, etc.

So perhaps the correct answer is A)6.24e-7.

But wait, another possibility is that the solution considers that the buffer is not between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but perhaps something else. Or perhaps I should consider all the ions and activity coefficients, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer between HPO4^2- and PO4^3- for the third ionization.

Wait, but the pH is 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3 (11.74), so the buffer equation for the third ionization would be:

pH = pKa3 + log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-])

Which I used earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the initial moles again.

Wait, the solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2000 liters.

Moles of KH2PO4:1g /136.09 g/mol = 1/136.09 ≈0.007345 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O:1g /177.99 g/mol ≈0.005612 mol.

So in 0.2 L, concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] =0.007345 / 0.2=0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] =0.005612 /0.2=0.02806 M.

So that part is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02806 M, and the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.036725 M.

So the buffer equation gives pH=7.091, as before.

Then, the concentration of PO4^3- comes from the third ionization of HPO4^2-.

So the formula for [PO4^3-] is [HPO4^2-] * (Ka3 / Kw )^(1/2) )?

Wait, no, that's for the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. Alternatively, using Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

So rearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+].

But [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.091) ≈8.23e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ) / (8.23e-8 ).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈5.05e-14.

Denominator:8.23e-8.

So 5.05e-14 /8.23e-8 ≈6.138e-7 M.

Ah, that's approximately 6.14e-7 M. Close to option A (6.24e-7).

Ah, so this approach gives 6.14e-7.

Wait, but when I did it earlier via the Henderson equation, I got 6.34e-7.

Hmm, so perhaps the discrepancy is due to the method of calculation.

Wait, let's compute this method precisely.

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02806 M.

[H+]=10^(-7.091)=10^(-7) * 10^(-0.091).

10^(-0.091)= approx 0.815.

So [H+]=1e-7 *0.815=8.15e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) /8.15e-8.

Compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02806=5.0508e-14.

Divide by 8.15e-8:

5.0508e-14 /8.15e-8 = (5.0508 /8.15) * 1e-6 ≈0.619 *1e-6=6.19e-7 M.

So approximately 6.19e-7 M.

Which is close to option A (6.24e-7) and option D (3.97e-7).

Hmm, but why did the Henderson approach give me 6.34e-7 and this approach gives 6.19e-7?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when using the Henderson approach. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier I used the Henderson equation for the third ionization, which is pH = pKa3 + log([PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]).

Which gives [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * 10^(pH - pKa3).

Which is the same as [PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-]*( [H+]/Ka3 )^(-1) ) ?

Wait, let's see.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

Rearranged: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/[H+].

Which is the same as what I did in the second approach.

So both methods should give the same result. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach's exponent calculation.

Wait, in the first approach, I had:

[PO4^3-] = [HPO4^2-] * 10^(pH - pKa3) → which is same as [HPO4^2-] * 10^{(7.091 -11.74)} = [HPO4^2-] * 10^(-4.649).

Which is same as [HPO4^2-] * (1e-4) * 10^(-0.649).

Wait, 10^(-0.649)= approx 0.224.

So 1e-4 *0.224=2.24e-5.

Multiply by [HPO4^2-]=0.02806 M.

0.02806 *2.24e-5= (0.02806 *2.24) *1e-5.

Compute 0.02806 *2.24 → 0.02806 *2=0.05612, 0.02806 *0.24=0.0067344.

Total ≈0.05612+0.0067344=0.0628544.

So 0.0628544e-5=6.285e-7 M.

Ah, that's about 6.285e-7 M.

So which is even closer to option A (6.24e-7).

So perhaps the correct answer is A) 6.24e-7 M.

But wait, the options don't have that exact number.

Wait, the options are:

A)6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7.

So option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close to our calculation of 6.28e-7.

Hmm, perhaps the slight difference is due to more precise calculations, or perhaps I made a minor error in the logarithm.

Wait, let me compute 10^(-4.648) precisely.

4.648 is 4 +0.648.

So 10^(-4.648) = 1e-4 *10^(-0.648).

Compute 10^(-0.648):

We can use a calculator-like approach.

We know that log(4) =0.60206, log(4.2)=0.6232.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the Taylor expansion or a precise computation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that ln(10)≈2.302585.

Wait, 10^x= e^{x ln(10)}.

So 10^(-0.648)=e^{-0.648 * ln(10)}.

0.648 * ln(10)≈0.648 *2.302585≈1.490.

So e^-1.490 ≈ 0.225.

Because e^-1=0.3679, e^-1.49≈0.225.

So 10^(-0.648)= ~0.225.

So 10^(-4.648)=1e-4 *0.225=2.25e-5.

So [PO4^3-]=0.02806 *2.25e-5 = 0.02806 * 2.25e-5.

Calculate 0.02806 *2.25 =0.063.

So 0.063e-5=6.3e-7.

Hmm, so 6.3e-7, which is about 6.3e-7 M.

Which is very close to option A (6.24e-7).

But the options don't have 6.3e-7. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the pH.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact pH without approximations.

The Henderson equation: pH = pKa2 + log (n2 / n1),

Where n2 is moles of HPO4^2- and n1 is moles of H2PO4^-.

n2=0.005612, n1=0.007345.

So ratio =0.005612/0.007345= 0.7647.

log(0.7647)=?

I can compute it more precisely.

Log(7.647)=0.88436.

So log(0.7647)=0.88436 -1= -0.11564.

So pH=7.2076 + (-0.11564)=7.09196.

So pH=7.092.

Then, pH-pKa3=7.092 -11.74= -4.648.

10^(-4.648)=?

We can compute it as 10^(-4) *10^(-0.648)= 1e-4 * (1/10^0.648).

Compute 10^0.648.

We can compute 10^0.648.

We can think that 0.648 is 0.6 +0.048.

10^0.6= approx 3.981.

Then, 10^0.048=approx 1.117.

So 3.981 *1.117≈4.438.

So 10^0.648≈4.438.

So 1/4.438≈0.2254.

So 1e-4 *0.2254=2.254e-5.

So [PO4^3-]=0.02806 M *2.254e-5= 6.31e-7 M.

So around 6.31e-7, which is ~6.3e-7.

The closest option is A)6.24e-7.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the initial moles of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are different.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the moles.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.

So 1 g /136.09 g/mol = 0.007345 moles.

Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O is: Na is 22.99, so 2×22.99=45.98; HPO4: H=1, P=30.97, O=4×16=64. So HPO4 is 1+30.97+64=95.97. So Na2HPO4 is 45.98 +95.97=141.95. Plus 2H2O: 2×(2×1 +16) =2×18=36. So total molar mass is 141.95 +36=177.95 g/mol, which matches the given 177.99. So moles=1g /177.99 g/mol= 0.005612 mol.

So that part is correct.

So I think the correct answer is A)6.24e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The molecular weights are 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005612 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in solution
- \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007345 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.036725 \, \text{M}\)
- \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005612 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02806 \, \text{M}\)

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves \(H₂PO₄⁻\) and \(HPO₄²⁻\), with \(pK_a = -\log(K_a)\). For \(K_a = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\), \(pK_a = 7.208\).

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = pK_a + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.02806}{0.036725}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.7647)
\]
\[
\log(0.7647) \approx -0.1156 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.1156 = 7.092
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \([PO₄³⁻]\) using the third dissociation
The third dissociation of phosphate is:
\[
HPO₄²⁻ \leftrightharpoons PO₄³⁻ + H^+
\]
The equilibrium constant is \(K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}\), so \(pK_a = 11.74\).

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the third dissociation:
\[
\text{pH} = pK_a + \log\left(\frac{[PO₄³⁻]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}\right)
\]
Rearranging:
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = [HPO₄²⁻] \times 10^{\text{pH} - pK_a}
\]
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = 0.02806 \times 10^{7.092 - 11.74}
\]
\[
7.092 - 11.74 = -4.648 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10^{-4.648} \approx 2.25 \times 10^{-5}
\]
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = 0.02806 \times 2.25 \times 10^{-5} \approx 6.31 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of \(PO₄³⁻\) is approximately \(6.31 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which is closest to option **A) \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.
