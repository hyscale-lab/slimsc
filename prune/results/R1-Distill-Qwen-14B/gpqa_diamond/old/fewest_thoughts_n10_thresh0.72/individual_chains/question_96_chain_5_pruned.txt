Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, but wait, how exactly? Oh right, there's this formula from the theory of black holes. I think it's something like S is proportional to the area of the event horizon divided by the Planck area. Oh wait, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. Or wait, maybe it's S = (A)/(4 l_p²) times some constant, where l_p is the Planck length. Oh right, because the Planck area is l_p squared, so the formula simplifies to A/(4 l_p²) times Boltzmann's constant or something like that. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

So, the question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. The distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the entropy, so I probably need to find the area A first. The angular size θ in radians would give me the diameter or something. Oh wait, θ is the angular size, which is the angle subtended by the event horizon. So if I have θ in radians, and the distance d, then the size of the event horizon r is approximately d * θ. Oh, but wait, since θ is small, maybe I can approximate the arc length as r ≈ d * θ. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I'll have to convert that
