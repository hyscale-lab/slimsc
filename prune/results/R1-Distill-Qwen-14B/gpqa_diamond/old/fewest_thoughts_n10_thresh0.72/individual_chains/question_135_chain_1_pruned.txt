Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about boson decay. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh right, the interaction term is probably something like X ψ ψ, meaning X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So X can decay into fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. And the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So the options are various combinations of fermion pairs.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion pair, the energy (the mass of the boson) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion because you need enough energy to create the particles. So each fermion has a rest mass, and when the boson mass is equal to or greater than twice that mass, the decay is allowed.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions (leptons and quarks) in GeV:

Electron (e-): practically 0, but non-zero. Maybe about 0.0005 GeV. So 2m is negligible. So X can decay into e+ e-.

Muon (μ-): around 0.105 GeV. So 2m is about 0.21 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so allowed.

Tau (τ-): around 1.777 GeV. 2m is ~3.554 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is more than that. So decay into tau pairs is allowed.

Now quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But wait, in decays, we usually observe the light quarks because heavy quarks (like charm, bottom, top) have large masses.

Masses:

Up and down quarks: very light, maybe around a few MeV each. So 2m is negligible. So X can decay into uū and dđ.

Strange quarks: around 100 MeV each. So 2m is about 0.2 GeV. X's mass is 6 GeV, so decay into sŝ is allowed.

Charm quarks: each around 1.2-1.5 GeV. 2m is about 2.4 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so yes, X can decay into c c̄.

Bottom quarks: each is about 4.5-4.7 GeV. 2m is around 9 GeV. Wait, X is 6 GeV. So 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV. Therefore, decay into b b̄ is not allowed because 6 < 2m_b. Wait, wait, wait, is it 2m or m each? Let me think. For pair production, you need at least 2m. So for bottom quarks, 2m is about 9 GeV. X is 6, which is less than 9. So decay into b anti-b is not allowed.

Top quark is even heavier, so no way.

So putting it all together: which fermion pairs can X decay into?

So possible decays are:

e+ e-,
μ+ μ-,
τ+ τ-,
u anti-u,
d anti-d,
s anti-s,
c anti-c.

Wait, but what about the quarks? Are the decay channels allowed for each of these?

Wait, but the interaction term is given as L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So the boson X couples to all fermions f, right? So any fermion can be produced, provided the mass is less than half of X's mass.

So let's list the fermions:

Leptons:
e, μ, τ. All allowed because 2m is much less than 6 GeV.

Quarks:
u, d, s: their 2m is much less than 6 GeV, so allowed.
c: 2m ~ 2.4 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
b: 2m ~9 GeV >6 → not allowed.
t: even heavier, so no.

So decay modes allowed are all pairs where the fermion is e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+τ-, e+ e-.

Wait, it includes b, which we said isn't allowed. So A is incorrect.
