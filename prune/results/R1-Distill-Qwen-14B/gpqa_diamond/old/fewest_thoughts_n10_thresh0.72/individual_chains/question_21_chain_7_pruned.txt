Okay, so I've got this question about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one at a time.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Oh right, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different structures. Like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that to happen, the compound must have adjacent carbonyl groups or something that allows that kind of shift.

Benzoquinoneâ€”I think that's a quinone structure. Quinones typically have two ketone groups. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. Wait, but wait, does benzoquinone have the possibility for tautomerism? Hmm, benzoquinone is a diketone, but the two ketone groups are in para positions. Can they undergo any kind of enol tautomerism? I'm not too sure. I think if the carbonyl groups are conjugated, maybe, but in benzoquinone, the ring's conjugation might not easily allow shifting. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't have any hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl, which is a requirement for enol tautomerism. Wait, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring, so the carbonyl is like Ar-C=O. The adjacent carbons are part of the ring, so no alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism can't occur because there's nothing to shift. So benzoquinone probably doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait another thing. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Are there any positions where alpha hydrogens are present? Let me visualize benzoquinone. It's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So each ketone is on a carbon attached to two other ring carbons. So those carbonyls don't have any adjacent hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So no alpha hydrogens, so no enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Now cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So the structure would have three carbonyl groups attached to the ring. Each of those carbonyls is attached to the cyclohexane, so each is like (CH2) groups next to them? Wait, no. Wait, in cyclohexane-1
