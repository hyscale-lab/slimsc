Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of various aromatic compounds with excess bromine. Each of the six substances (1 to 6) is undergoing this reaction, and we're supposed to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. 

Hmm, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's an electron-donating or withdrawing group.

Let me list out the six substances:

1) C6H5-CH3 → Toluene (methyl group attached to benzene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 → Benzoyl ethyl ester? Wait, no, wait. COOC2H5 is an ester group. So it's a benzoyloxy ethyl group? Wait, no, wait: wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh wait, no, wait. The formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. So that would be benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group, which is connected to an O and then an ethyl group. So that's a benzoyloxy ethyl group? Or wait, no, maybe it's benzene with a COOEt group (where Et is ethyl). So the substituent is a carbonyloxyethyl group. Hmm, that's an ester group. So that's like a benzene ring with a -COOEt substituent.

Wait, COOEt is an electron-withdrawing group because the ester has a carbonyl which is electron-withdrawing. So that's a deactivating, meta-directing substituent.

3) C6H5-Cl → Chlorobenzene. Chlorine is an electronegative atom. I remember that in chlorobenzene, the Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group because it's an electron-withdrawing via inductive effect but can donate electrons through resonance, but overall it deactivates the ring. So it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions, but since it's deactivating, the ring is less reactive.

4) C6H5-NO2 → Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing substituent. Because it's a strong electron-withdrawing group, it deactivates the ring and directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position.

5) C6H5-C2H5 → Ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Alkyl groups donate electrons through the inductive effect, activating the ring and directing incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

6) C6H5-COOH → Benzoic acid. The -COOH group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing substituent. The carboxylic acid group is electron-withdrawing, so it deactivates the ring and directs substitution to the meta position.

Wait, but wait: wait, for substituents that are deactivating and meta-directing, the main factor is whether they are strong deactivating. For example, Cl is deactivating but still ortho/para-directing because of resonance donation, but nitro and COOH are meta-directing.

So, for each substituent, I need to determine where the para isomer would be major or minor.

Wait, no. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So they are each undergoing bromination. The question is about the percentage of the para-bromo isomer (vs ortho, meta) formed.

Wait, but in some cases, when the substituent is meta-directing, the para isomer might not be the major product. Wait, actually, for meta-directing groups, the incoming electrophile tends to go to the meta position relative to the substituent. So if the substituent is meta-directing, the para position would not be a major site.

Wait, but wait: when the substituent is ortho/para-directing (like methyl, Cl, ethyl), the incoming electrophile tends to add at the ortho, para positions. So the major product would be a mix of ortho and para, with para often being more favored, especially in cases where the substituent is bulky. But for meta-directing, the major product would be meta, so the para would be a minor component.

Wait, but let me think about each substituent:

1) Toluene (methyl).
