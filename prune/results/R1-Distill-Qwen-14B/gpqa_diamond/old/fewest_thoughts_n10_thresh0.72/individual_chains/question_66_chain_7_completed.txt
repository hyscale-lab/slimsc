Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Hmm, I remember a bit from my particle physics class, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through this.

The question gives four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick which combination is correct.

First, I need to understand what each of these symmetries mean and whether operators in SMEFT must respect them.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, but it's supposed to incorporate all possible operators that are allowed by the Standard Model's symmetries. Wait, but does SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry? I'm pretty sure that yes, because the operators are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant. Effective theories usually still maintain the same symmetries as the underlying theories. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry along with translations. Wait, but Poincare is a bigger symmetry. The effective theory is built in a way that the operators are local, which implies they respect Poincare. So Poincare symmetry (2) must also be respected. So options without 1 or 2 are probably wrong. Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. Option D includes 1,3,4.

Wait, but what about Poincare versus Lorentz. Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if the theory respects Poincare, then Lorentz symmetry is automatically included. But the question is about what must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is required, then Lorentz is too. But perhaps the question includes both as separate.

Wait, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So yes, they must respect Lorentz symmetry. But Poincare? I think that's a larger symmetry. SMEFT is a field theory, so it's built in a way that respects Poincare. Because it's a quantum field theory, right? So all operators must be Poincare-invariant as well. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about the other options: CP symmetry (3) and CPT symmetry (4). I'm a bit more fuzzy on these. I know that the Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP. So in SMEFT, which is an extension of the SM, must all operators respect CP or CPT?

Wait, the SMEFT includes all possible operators that are allowed by the SM's gauge symmetry. The SM doesn't have a requirement for CP symmetry, but it does have CPT symmetry because all of its terms are CPT-invariant. Hmm, but that's a bit confusing.

Wait, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. I think that all terms in the Lagrangian must be invariant under CPT. Because, in quantum field theory, the LSZ formula and the way we construct S-matrix requires CPT symmetry. So operators in the SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (4) because it's a general QFT requirement.

What about CP symmetry? The SM doesn't have a requirement for CP symmetry. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So the SMEFT can have operators that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So only CPT is a must, but CP isn't.

So, putting it together, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Oh wait, but Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, does that mean it automatically respects Lorentz? So perhaps the question is about which symmetries "must be respected"—so both Lorentz and Poincare would be required. But wait, Poincare includes Lorentz. So if the operator respects Poincare, then Lorentz is automatically respected.

But the question is, which symmetries must be respected. So the SMEFT must respect all operators that are Poincare-invariant because it's a field theory. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

So looking at the options: option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. So since option C includes 1,2,4, that would be correct because all SMEFT operators must be Poincare-invariant (so both 1 and 2 are correct) and CPT-invariant (4 correct). So option C would be the right choice.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Do I need to respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz, or just Lorentz? Because if operators are Poincare-invariant, then Lorentz is automatically a subset. So the question is, do all SMEFT operators respect both 1 and 2, or just 2.

Wait, the Poincare group includes translations and Lorentz transformations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect both. So the operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, which implies they respect Lorentz. So the question is asking which symmetries must be respected. So if Poincare is one of the options, implying both translation and Lorentz, but the question lists Lorentz as 1 and Poincare as 2. So the correct points would be that all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, but the question is multiple options. So the options with both 1 and 2 are correct.

So, the must-respect symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Which option is that? Looking at the choices:

Option C: 1,2,4. That's 1,2,4.

So the correct answer would be option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a low-energy effective theory that incorporates all possible operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any quantum field theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a quantum field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry, which implies that Lorentz symmetry is automatically included.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not necessarily respect CP symmetry (e.g., CP violation is present in the CKM matrix). Therefore, SMEFT operators do not need to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory and must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Since Poincaré symmetry already includes Lorentz symmetry, both 1 and 2 are correct. Additionally, CPT symmetry (4) is a fundamental requirement.

Thus, the correct combination of symmetries is **1, 2, and 4**, corresponding to **Option C**.

Answer: C
