Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about gene interactions contributing to resistance against a fungal disease in white lupine. There are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants and double mutants, and tested their resistance.

The data given shows the resistance percentages compared to the wild-type control. Wild-type is 100%, and each mutant shows varying levels. The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes.

So the data I've got:
- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Wait, some observations. The g2 single mutant is 0%, which is the same as some double mutants. That suggests that G2 might be acting upstream of other genes, maybe its function is necessary for the others to work. Because when G2 is knocked out, even if another gene is present (like in g2g3 or g1g2), the resistance is still 0%. So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, like G1 and G3. Because if G2 isn't working, then neither are G1 and G3. That would explain why the double mutants with G2 are the same as G2 alone.

Looking at G2's role: when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, and when combined with any other single gene knockout, it's still 0%. So G2 seems to be essential for the pathway. So G2 is a transcription factor upstream of others.

Next, looking at the other genes. The g3 single mutant is 50% resistance. If G2 is a TF, then G3 might be downstream of G2. Similarly, G1's single mutant is 75% resistance. So when G1 is knocked out, the resistance drops, but not as much as when G3 is knocked out.

Now, what about the double mutants? Let's look at g1g3: 10% resistance. That's lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So the effect is more severe than each alone, suggesting an additive or synergistic effect. Wait, but if G2 is the master, so why isn't the resistance 0% here?

Wait, maybe G2 isn't the only one. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 have some overlapping functions. Because when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. Hmm, but I thought G2 was the TF. So maybe G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2 but have some redundancy or other relationships.

Wait, let's think about epistasis. Epistatic genes are those whose mutations mask the effect of other mutations. So if G2 is epistatic
