Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question asks to arrange five nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive in aqueous solution. The nucleophiles given are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

Wait, so I need to compare their nucleophilic strengths. I remember that in a polar protic solvent (like water), the strength of a nucleophile depends on its ability to donate electrons and the solvation it undergoes.

In polar protic solvents, smaller and less solvated ions are better nucleophiles. Because they're less stabilized by the solvent, they can attack more readily. So, the key is to look at the ions' charge, size, and how well they're solvated.

Let me list the nucleophiles with their charges:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: It's the conjugate base of cyclohexanol. So it has a negative charge on an oxygen in a cyclic structure. It's a strong base but may not be the best nucleophile because of solvation? Wait, cyclohexoxide is a bulky base, but in a solution, how does that affect nucleophilicity.

2. Hydroxide ion (OH‚Åª): It's a strong nucleophile. But in water, it's heavily solvated
