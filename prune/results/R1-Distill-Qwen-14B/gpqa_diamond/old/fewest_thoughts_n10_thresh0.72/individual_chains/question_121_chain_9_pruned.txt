Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct product when a specific epoxide reacts with Me2CuLi. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. That's a mouthful. I remember bicyclic compounds can sometimes be tricky. Let me visualize its structure. The bicyclo[4.1.0] heptane part means it's a norbornane structure, right? Norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, but this one is [4.1.0], which I think is a different arrangement. Wait, bicyclo[m.n.p] means the bridge lengths. So [4.1.0]heptane would have bridges of 4,1, and 0 carbons? Not sure, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the epoxide as part of a bicyclic system. The 7-oxa means there's an oxygen in the ring, so it's an epoxide. So the epoxide is in a bridge position. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6. Let's see: the structure must be a bridged epoxide with three methyl groups and an oxygen bridge.

But perhaps I should focus more on the reaction. The problem says that when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates (like Me2CuLi), the alkyl group from the reagent is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, the nucleophile adds with inversion of configuration at that carbon.

Wait, let me recall: organocuprates are strong nucleophiles, typically undergoing conjugate addition or opening epoxides. For epoxide ring opening, the nucleophile attacks the less hindered (more substituted? Or less substituted?) carbon. Oh, wait, the question says the alkyl is introduced at the less hindered carbon. So the cuprate adds to the less substituted, maybe the less hindered, position. But I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

In disubstituted epoxides, when the cuprate attacks, there's inversion of configuration at the carbon where
