Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The planet's transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still showing both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm, okay. So, transit and occultation events. I remember that a transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, causing an increase in brightness because we can't see the planet's light anymore.

Wait, but for both events to occur, the orbital periods and the sizes must be such that the second planet is both larger and its orbit is arranged so that it can pass in front and behind the star relative to our line of sight. Or is it the other way around?

Wait no, occultation is when the planet moves behind the star. So for that to happen, the planet must be larger than the star? No, that's not right. Wait, no. The occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so it's the star blocking the planet. The planet's size doesn't have to be larger than the star—just that the planet is emitting enough light that when it's behind the star, its light is blocked, so we see a dip (occultation). Or wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Occultation is when the star passes in front of the planet, blocking it. So the planet's brightness is blocked. So for that, the planet needs to be in a position where the star can pass in front of it. So the orbital period of the second planet must allow this.

Wait, but the first planet has a 3-day period. The second planet is bigger—2.5 Earth radii, so larger than Earth. Wait, but wait, the star is 1.5 Solar radii. Let me think: Earth's radius is about 0.00917 times the Sun's radius. So 2.5 Earth radii is 0.0229 times the Sun's radius. The star is 1.5 times the Sun, so 1.5 R_sun. So the second planet's radius is about (0.0229 R_sun) while the star is 1.5 R_sun. So the planet is much smaller than the star. So the star is bigger. So for occultation, when the planet is behind the star, from our perspective, the star would block the planet. But if the planet is much smaller, wouldn't the star's disk completely cover it during occultation,
