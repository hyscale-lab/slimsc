Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's a titration problem involving acetic acid and NaOH. I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and figuring out things like pH at certain points. Right, so let's break this down.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Okay, first step is to figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Wait, wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution will be halved, right? Because same moles in double the volume.

So original moles of acetic acid: M = moles/volume (cm³), so moles = M * volume (cm³). So 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = 1 mmol. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, but wait, wait—no, wait. Oh, wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol per liter. 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Which is 1 mmol. When we dilute with 20 cm³ water, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So new concentration is moles/volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is same, 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH required would be moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point. So for 25% titration, we use 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

But wait, another approach is to calculate moles. So 25% of the required NaOH. So 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio.

So the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So let's model the initial solution after dilution (before adding any NaOH). We have 0.025 M CH3COOH. Then, when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (0.1 M), which is 0.00025 mol. So the moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and the moles of CH3COO^- will increase by same amount.

But wait, wait. The total volume when 2.5 cm³ NaOH is added is
