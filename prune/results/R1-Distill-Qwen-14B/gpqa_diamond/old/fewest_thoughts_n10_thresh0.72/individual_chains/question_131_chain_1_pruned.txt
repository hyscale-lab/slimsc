Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Hmm, I remember that in anhydrides, the carbonyl groups usually appear around 165-185 ppm in 13C NMR. So the 165 ppm peak is likely the carbonyl. The 137 ppm might be a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, maybe a carbon from the alkene?

Wait, the 1H NMR has only one peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that all the protons are equivalent, or maybe there's just one type of proton in the anhydride. Since the starting material was a cis-alkene, the anhydride probably formed from it. Maybe it's a cyclic anhydride, like a cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride.

The anhydride then reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. I think this is an example of a Diels-Alder reaction. The diene (cyclopentadiene) would react with a dienophile (the anhydride) to form a six-membered ring. The products are a major and a minor product, both with formula C13H16O3.

The NOESY spectra show that the major product has a cross-peak, meaning there's spatial proximity between two protons, while the minor product doesn't. So, the major product likely has some trans stereochemistry, causing certain protons to be close in space.

Looking at the options for the NMR signals connected by the cross-peak, I need to figure out which two sets of protons are near each other.

First, let's think about the structure of the reactants. The anhydride from the cis-dicarboxylic acid would have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected
