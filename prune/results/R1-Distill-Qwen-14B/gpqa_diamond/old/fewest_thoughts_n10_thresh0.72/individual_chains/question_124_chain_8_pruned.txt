Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let me try to break it down. Hmm. Alright, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls. The question is, what Lorentz factor would we need so that about two-thirds reach the walls instead?

Wait, Lorentz factor. Oh right, that's gamma, which is the factor by which time dilation and length contraction occur in special relativity. Gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does that relate to the particles reaching the detector's walls?

Oh, right! The particles are traveling from the center of the detector, so the distance they need to cover is the radius of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. So, the time it takes for each particle to reach the wall is important, but since they're moving at relativistic speeds, time dilation comes into play.

Wait, but how does the fraction of particles reaching the walls depend on gamma? Let me think. Maybe it's about the particles' lifetime. If a particle has a mean lifetime tau in its rest frame, then in the lab frame, it's longer by gamma * tau. So the particles that can reach the detector walls are those for which the time it takes to travel 30 meters is less than gamma * tau. 

But wait, the problem says that at gamma ~20, only one third reach the walls. So, maybe the decay time is such that at gamma=20, only 1/3 make it. We need to find the gamma where 2/3 make it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the velocity. Ultra-relativistic particles have v ≈ c. So, the time to reach the wall is approximately t = R/(v) = 30 m / (v). But since they're moving at v≈c, that's about 30/(3e8) seconds, which is 1e-7 seconds. But how does that relate to their lifetime?

Wait, particles decay over time. The proper lifetime is tau, so the lab frame sees it as gamma * tau. So, the particle will reach the wall only if the travel time is less than gamma tau. So, the fraction of particles that decay before reaching the wall is the probability that their lifetime is less than t. But wait, the particles that reach the wall are those that haven't decayed by time t.

Wait, but the problem states that on average, one third reach the walls. So, that implies that the probability of the particle not decaying during the time it takes to reach the wall is 1/3.

The probability that a particle doesn't decay by time t is exp(-t/tau). So, when t is the time to reach the wall, which is R/(v). Since v is relativistic, v≈c. So, t ≈ R/(c) = 30 m / 3e8 m/s = 1e-7 seconds.

Wait no, wait. No, the proper time for the particle is tau. The lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma * tau. So, the time t in lab frame is R/(v) = R/(gamma c) * since v = beta c, and beta is approximately 1 for high gamma. So, t ≈ R/(gamma c).

Wait, because v is beta c, so t = R/(beta c), and beta is approximately 1 for gamma >>1. So, t ≈ R/(c) * (1/gamma), since beta is 1.

So, for a particle to reach the wall without decaying, the condition is t < gamma tau. Because the particle's proper lifetime is tau, and in lab frame, it's gamma tau. So, if the time it takes to reach the wall is less than gamma tau, then the particle hasn't decayed yet and reaches the wall.

So, t = 30 m / (v) = 30/(beta c). And since beta = v/c
