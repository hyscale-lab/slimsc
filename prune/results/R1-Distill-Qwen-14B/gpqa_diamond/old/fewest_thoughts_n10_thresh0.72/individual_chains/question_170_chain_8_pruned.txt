Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation. So, the expectation value of S_y would be the state vector multiplied by the S_y operator, then multiplied by the conjugate transpose of the state vector. Wait, more specifically, it's ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

But what's the S_y operator in this context? Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The σ_y matrix is given as:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And since spin operators are (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices, S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y. So the operator is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

The state vector is given as (3i, 4). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T. Since it's a spin-1/2 system, the state vector should be normalized, but I'm not sure if I need to normalize it here because the expectation value might not require it. Or wait, maybe I should check normalization first.

Wait, the state vector is (3i,4), so the inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4). Let me compute that. 3i times -3i is (-9i^2), which is (-9)(-1) =9. Then 4 times 4 is 16. So total is 9+16=25. Oh, the state is not normalized because the inner product is 25. So the norm is sqrt(25)=5. So the state vector's magnitude is 5, meaning it's (3i/5, 4/5) when normalized. Hmm, but wait, for expectation value, do I need to normalize it? Let me think. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩, if the state isn't normalized. Or wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Actually, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ only if the state is not normalized. Because if the state is a normalized ket, then ⟨ψ|ψ⟩=1. So in this case, since ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is 25, the expectation value would be ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ divided by 25.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. I think I might be mixing things up. Let me get back to the basics. The expectation value of an operator O is given by (⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩) only if the state |ψ⟩ isn't normalized. But wait, actually, the expectation value formula is ⟨O⟩ = (⟨ψ|
