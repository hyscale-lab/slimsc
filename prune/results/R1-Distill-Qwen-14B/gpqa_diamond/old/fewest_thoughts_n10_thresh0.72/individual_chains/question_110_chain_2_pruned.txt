Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I remember from the question that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So, each star must have an apparent magnitude that's less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, because the limit is brighter than that. So if the apparent magnitude is brighter than the limit, meaning it's smaller, like mag 16 is brighter than 17. So a star with V mag 16.5 is fainter than 17 but brighter than 16.5? Wait, no:ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So that's apparent V mag less than 17. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So if a star's V mag is 17 or less than 17, it is brighter than 17? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So a star with V mag =17 is exactly at the limit. But wait, magnitude is a bit tricky. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V=17 is dimmer than one with V=16. So the condition is that the
