Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the CERN Bubble Chamber and the decay of a particle. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Right, so the decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime depends on the particle's speed, which is related to its energy.

The problem is about the resolution of the Bubble Chamber. I remember that in particle detectors, the resolution determines how precisely you can measure the position where a particle decays. To observe the decay, the particles Y and Z must be detected. But if the decay path is too long, the chamber might not resolve them as coming from the same point.

So the minimum resolution needed is such that the decay length (the distance the particle moves before decaying) is measured accurately enough to see at least 30% of the decays. Wait, no, perhaps it's about the fraction of decays that occur within a certain length, which the detector can resolve.

Wait, more accurately, the idea is that for a moving particle, the decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime (dilated). The detector has a resolution which is the minimum distance it can measure. So we need to find the minimum resolution (maybe the decay length) such that at least 30% of the particles decay within that distance, allowing the detector to see them as the same point.

So the steps I think are:

1. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma for the particle X⁰.
   Gamma is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / (m c²), but here E is given in GeV and mass is in GeV/c², so perhaps it's just E/(m c²) but c is in the units.

Wait, but in particle physics units, c is often set to 1, but I'm not sure. Wait, more accurately,
