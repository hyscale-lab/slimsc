Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Astronomers found a planet around each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data points given are the periodic shifts of a spectral line. For Planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves due to the planet's gravitational pull, so the spectral lines shift as the star moves towards or away from us. The shift amplitude depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, but how exactly do these shifts (measured in milliangstroms) relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method's observed velocity semi-amplitude (K) is what's measured. Oh wait, the shift in wavelength is related to the velocity via the Doppler effect formula. The formula I recall is K = (v * lambda) / c, but I might have that backwards. Alternatively, the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So the velocity v is (delta_lambda) * c / lambda. But I think the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the star's velocity towards or away from us.

But wait, the problem is giving the shifts in milliangstroms, not velocities. So I need to relate the shift to the velocity, and then connect that to the orbital period.

I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star. The formula I think is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( ( (P) * (2*pi) ) / (2 * pi) )^(1/3) ) )? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But wait, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So that simplifies to K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But I might be complicating it. Alternatively, I think the formula is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c P) ) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, perhaps if I can express K in terms of the Doppler shift. Because the problem gives the shift in wavelength, which is delta_lambda, so delta_lambda = lambda * (v/c), where v is the velocity.

So, K is proportional to delta_lambda. But wait, the same star's spectral lines would have a certain rest wavelength, and the Doppler shift is delta_lambda. So the shift is proportional to the star's velocity.

So if Planet #1 has a shift of 5 mas and Planet #2 7 mas, their velocities K would be proportional to these shifts, assuming the rest wavelength (lambda) is the same for both (since it's the same spectral line). So K1/K2 = 5/7.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods. How does K relate to the period P?

Let me think about the RV formula again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P) / (2 * pi * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates K to the orbital period and other factors.

Wait, the formula I think is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (P/ (2 pi )) )^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ (G M_p sin i ) / (M_*^(1/3)) ) * (1) / ( ( P/(2 pi) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps rearranging to solve for P in terms of K.

Let me write this as:

K = ( (G M_p sin i ) ) / ( M_*^(1/3) ( (P/(2 pi) )^(1/3) ) ) )

Hmm, maybe cube both sides:

K^3 = (G^3 M_p^3 sin^3 i ) / ( M_* (P/(2 pi) ) )

So,

K^3 = (G^3 M_p^3 sin^3 i * 2 pi ) / (M_* P )

Rearranging to solve for P:

P = (G^3 M_p^3 sin^3 i * 2 pi ) / (M_* K^3 )

Wait, but since both planets have the same mass (since they are similar to Neptune) and same star mass (same as Sun), and same sin i (assuming both are edge-on, which is a standard assumption for maximum effect), then the ratio of their periods can be found by comparing their K values.

So for planet 1 and 2:

P1 / P2 = [ (G^3 M_p^3 sin^3 i * 2 pi ) / (M_* K1^3 ) ] / [ (G^3 M_p^3 sin^3 i * 2 pi ) / (M_* K2^3 ) ]

Simplify:

P1/P2 = (K2^3) / (K1^3 )

Because all other factors cancel out.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, P is proportional to K^-3, because in the denominator we have K^3. So if K increases, P decreases.

So P ∝ 1/(K^3). Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me think again. Let me write the formula:

P ∝ 1/(K^3) 

Because for higher K, the period is shorter. For the same mass star and same planet mass, higher K implies shorter period. Because a more massive planet would cause a bigger K, but since the planet masses are same, higher K implies a shorter period.

So, if K1 is 5 mas and K2 is 7 mas, then K2 is larger than K1. So P2 would be shorter than P1? Or wait, no, because P is inversely proportional to K^3.

Wait, the question is asking how much longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1. So the ratio is P2 / P1.

Given that P ∝ 1/K^3, then P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me say, if K doubles, then P would be 1/(2^3) = 1/8th as long. So yes, P is inversely proportional to K^3.

So let's compute (K1/K2)^3.

K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. That means P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.36. So the period of #2 is ~0.36 times the period of #1. Therefore, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? Wait, no, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? Oh wait, no. The question says, 'how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?' So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. Therefore, P2 is shorter than P1. So the answer would be that P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the answer would be option A, which is ~0.36.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in reasoning.

Because the Doppler shift is directly proportional to the velocity (K), and velocity is inversely proportional to the period. Because K is higher when the period is shorter. Because if the star is moving back and forth quickly (small period), the velocity (K) would be higher for the same planet mass.

So K is proportional to (M_p / (M_* )) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), because in the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So P ∝ 1/K^3. Therefore, P is inversely proportional to the cube of K.

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then:

P1 ∝ 1/(5^3) = 1/125

P2 ∝ 1/(7^3) = 1/343

So P2 / P1 = (1/343) / (1/125) ) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.36 times P1. So Planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of Planet #1, meaning it's shorter. But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is P2/P1 ≈ 0.36. So P2 is ~0.36 times as long as P1. So 0.36 times as long means it's shorter, so it's not longer. So the period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of Planet #1. So the orbital period of Planet #2 is shorter than that of Planet #1 by a factor of about 0.36.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, so option A.

Wait, but the options are presented as:

A) ~ 0.36

B) ~ 1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the correct answer is A: ~0.36.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( P \propto 1/K^3 \). This relationship arises because \( K \) depends on the star's velocity, which is influenced by the planet's orbital characteristics.

Given that Planet #1 has a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)) and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)), the ratio of their periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's period is shorter than Planet #1's period by a factor of approximately 0.36.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
