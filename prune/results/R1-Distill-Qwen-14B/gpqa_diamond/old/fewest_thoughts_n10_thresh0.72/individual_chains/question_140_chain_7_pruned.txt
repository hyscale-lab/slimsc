Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons, which probably means it's a noble gas because noble gases have atoms with complete electron shells, but wait, the gas is a molecule, so maybe it's not a noble gas. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like H2O or something else where protons and neutrons are equal.

Wait, if W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, let's think about the atomic composition. Let's say the molecule is made of atoms. For each atom, the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. That would mean each atom is a noble gas because noble gases have equal protons and neutrons. But wait, noble gas atoms are monoatomic, but the question says the molecule has the same number. Hmm, maybe the molecule is something like CO2, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's H2, but that's diatomic and each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the molecule is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is O2. Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the most common isotope O-16. So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2's molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total. So the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons, which is 16 each. That fits the description. So gas W is O2? Or maybe another diatomic gas where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe it's CH4, but the math doesn't add up. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something like D2O (deuterium oxide), but that's probably not. Alternatively, let me consider another approach.

The reaction is violent, which suggests a strong reaction, perhaps an acid-base reaction. Substance X reacts with Y to produce a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B. When heated, G releases B, so B is probably a gas or a volatile substance. The melting point of B is close to 277 K.
