Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question provides.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, molecular formula analysis. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Plugging into the formula: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is three double bonds, so three degrees) and a double bond plus a ring? Or maybe a benzene and a conjugated system.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe a conjugated aldehyde?

- 6.98 (d, 2H). Two protons as a doublet. Could be aromatic protons.

- 6.51 (d, 2H). Another doublet, perhaps another set of aromatic protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring, where two protons are in the meta position relative to substituents.

Wait, or maybe this is a substituted benzene with substituents that make a doublet. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a substituent adjacent to the aldehyde.

- 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, 2H. Could be protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a dienol or something. Or maybe an enol form?

- 3.66 (d, 2H). A doublet for two protons. That might be a CH2 group attached to something electronegative. Like OCH2 or something similar.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and an OCH2 group. Wait, let me think. Maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde with substituents and something else.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. Benzene is C6H6. So the rest would be C2H3NO. Hmm, but perhaps it's a substituted benzaldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzaldehyde with a side chain.

Wait, the NMR has an aldehyde at 9.72. So the compound likely has a benzaldehyde group. Let me see: Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. But our compound is C8H9NO, so perhaps we have another substituent on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted benzaldehyde with an ethyl group or something else.

Wait, the NMR also shows a triplet at 9.72 for the aldehyde proton. So perhaps the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond
