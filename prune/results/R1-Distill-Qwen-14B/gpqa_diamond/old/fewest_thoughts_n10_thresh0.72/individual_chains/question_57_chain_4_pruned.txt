Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that involves phase shifts and scattering amplitudes. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) in terms of the partial waves and phase shifts. The formula involves a sum over all the angular momentum states, each contributing terms with their respective phase shifts.

The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) * e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) * P_l(cosθ) ), where δ_l is the phase shift for each l, and P_l is the Legendre polynomial. Oh wait, but the question is specifically asking about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So θ would be zero degrees in that case because the incident beam is along the direction we're measuring.

When θ is 0 degrees, what happens to the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ)? Oh right, P_l(1) is just 1 for all l. So that simplifies the expression because cos0 is 1. So the scattering amplitude along the beam direction (θ=0) only depends on the sum of terms for each l, each multiplied by 1.

So the formula simplifies to f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) * e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ). But wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond the given ones. So I guess we're only considering up to l=4, since δ_0 to δ_4 are given.

So the sum would be from l=0 to l=4. Let me write them down:

δ_0 =90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°.

Wait, but angles in radians are needed for the exponential function. So I should convert all δ_l from degrees to radians. Let me note that.

But wait, let's think about each term in the sum: (2l+1) * e^{2iδ_l} -1. So for each l, I calculate that term and then sum them all, multiply by 1/(2ik), and that gives f(0).

The question asks for the imaginary part of f(0), right? So I'll need to compute f(0), find its imaginary part.

But wait, what about k? Oh, k is the wave number of the incident electrons. We are told the energy is 50 MeV. Hmm, I need to find k using the energy.

The electrons are relativistic, I suppose, since 50 MeV is a significant fraction of their rest mass (which is about 0.511 MeV). So the relativistic energy relation applies. The energy E is related to the momentum p by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. 

But
