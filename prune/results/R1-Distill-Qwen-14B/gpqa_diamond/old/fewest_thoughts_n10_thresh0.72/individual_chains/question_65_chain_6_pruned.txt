Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The problem has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to choose the correct major products from the options given. Let me look at each reaction separately.

Starting with Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH (which is potassium hydride), and then H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is a strong base. When alcohols are treated with such bases, they usually deprotonate to form alkoxide ions. But wait, the starting material here is a spiro compound with an alcohol and an adjacent double bond.

Wait, spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the oxygen. The structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the spiro atom is the one where two rings are connected, and there's a double bond (en) at position 5, and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the spiro oxygen.

So when KH is added, it's a strong base and a good source of H- (hydride). But wait, no, KH is a strong base, but in this context, maybe it's deprotonating the alcohol to form an alkoxide. Alternatively, since it's a base, perhaps it's abstracting a proton to form an enolate, but that's usually in ketones or esters. Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is an alcohol. When an alcohol is treated with a strong base like KH, it can deprotonate to form an alkoxide. But I'm not sure if that's the main pathway here. Another possibility is that the base could induce some kind of elimination or ring-opening, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, could it be a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclization?

Wait, another thought: the compound is a spiro alcohol with a double bond nearby. When treated with a strong base, maybe it undergoes some kind of elimination. Or perhaps the base abstracts a proton that leads to cyclopropane formation or some annulation.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think about possible reactions involving spiro alcohols when treated with strong bases. Oh, I remember that when certain cyclic alcohols are treated with a strong base, they can undergo a conjugate elimination, leading to the formation of a ketone or a ring expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of the Aldol reaction or some kind of cyclization. Wait, the other part of the reaction is H+ at the end, so maybe after deprotonation, something else happens.

Wait, another angle: the starting material has a spiro structure, meaning two rings connected at one atom. When a base abstracts a proton, maybe it opens up the spiro structure. But in this case, the structure is 1-vinylspiro, which might have the possibility of forming a larger ring through some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the Cope elimination or some other elimination reaction. Or perhaps the base induces the formation of an en
