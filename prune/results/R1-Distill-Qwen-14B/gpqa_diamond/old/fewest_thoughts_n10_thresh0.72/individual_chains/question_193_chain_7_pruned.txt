Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Hmm. My understanding is a bit rusty, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth at different times of the year. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds), so d = 1/plx. So plx = 1/d.

The question says the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So N, the number of stars, is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5.

But since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting, N ∝ (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. That would mean that as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. But wait, that doesn't make sense because typically, the number of stars you can see should increase with distance up to a point, but I think this is more about the distribution.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The number of stars observed in a region of the sky as a function of distance. I remember that the number of stars you observe in a volume of space depends on the volume. Because stars are spread out, so the number density might be roughly constant, so for a volume, the number would be proportional to the volume.

Volume, in spherical terms, is (4/3)πr³. So if you have a range of distance, say from r to r + dr, the volume is approximately 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r² dr.

Wait, but this is when the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So for a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr, the volume is 4π r² dr.
