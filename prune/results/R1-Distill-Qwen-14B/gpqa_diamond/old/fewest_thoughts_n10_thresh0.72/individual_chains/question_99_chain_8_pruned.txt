Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The options are four different structures, and I have to pick the correct one based on the spectral data provided.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching. The broadness is because O-H bonds are hydrogen-bonded, which stretches the peak. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But wait, the peak at 1700 in a carboxylic acid might be a bit lower than that, but maybe it's due to hydrogen bonding or some other effect. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone. Hmm.

Wait, carboxylic acids have a broad peak from O-H in the 2500-3300 region, which fits the 3000 cm⁻¹ peak. But their carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm⁻¹ too. So that fits, but let me not jump to conclusions yet.

Looking at the NMR data: several signals, none are vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. Also, the structure must be such that when split, the signals produce specific multiplets. 

The NMR has two specific signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit complex. Let me try to parse this. 

A doublet of triplets of quartets is a splitting pattern resulting from coupling with three different sets of neighboring protons. Each splitting step would occur due to neighboring protons. For example, if each proton is next to another group that splits it into a triplet, and so on.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structures given and their possible NMR signals. Let's look at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)
