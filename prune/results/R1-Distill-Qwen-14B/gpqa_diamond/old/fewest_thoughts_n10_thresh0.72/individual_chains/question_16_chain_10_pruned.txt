Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a compound has chiral centers. But wait, there are exceptions too, like meso compounds. Oh right, meso compounds have multiple stereocenters but are achiral because of a plane of symmetry.

So, the question lists seven compounds, and I need to count how many are optically active. Let me go through each one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-C(Cl)(CH3). The configuration is Z, which means the higher priority groups are on the same side. Does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C2 has substituents: Cl, CH3, and two CH2 groups? Or wait, no, let me draw it. Oh wait, structure is CH2Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1: Cl, CH2CH2CH3? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCl-CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But with substituents. So 1-chloro would
