Okay, I've got this question about molecular symmetry, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. 

Wait, right, C3h is a type of molecular point group. The point group designations can be a bit tricky, but I think C3h involves a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane perpendicular to the main axis.

The options given are four different molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. I'm not exactly sure what this structure looks like. The name suggests it's a trifuran with substituents. Trifuran has three fused furan rings, I think. Triphenylene might have three phenyl groups attached. Wait, but I'm not sure, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Again, a trifuran derivative. The substituents are in certain positions. Benzo suggests a benzene ring attached, but how?

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has a boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. The structure is symmetric because all three substituents are the same. So the molecule has a trigonal planar arrangement around boron. Wait, but what about symmetry? If all three isopropyl groups are identical, the molecule probably has a C3 axis, but does it have a mirror plane? Let me think. The molecule is symmetric upon 120-degree rotations, so it's at least C3. Are there any mirror planes? Each isopropyl group is in a plane that's
