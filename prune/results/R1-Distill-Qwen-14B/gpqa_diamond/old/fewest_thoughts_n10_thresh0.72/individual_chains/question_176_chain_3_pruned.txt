Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So the problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a 3-element vector, so the system is in a 3-dimensional space. Got it. Then there are two observables, P and Q, whose operators are given as square matrices. 

The matrix for P has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, that looks like a symmetric matrix. And for Q, the matrix is diagonal: (1, 0, 0) in the first row, second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but the way measurements work is that when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of the corresponding operator. So if you measure P and get a particular value, the state after that measurement is the corresponding eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q after that would depend on the state after P's measurement.

But wait, the problem is about the probability of getting a specific outcome in each measurement. So, first, I need to find the probability of measuring P=0. Then, given that the state has collapsed to the eigenstate corresponding to P=0, I need to find the probability of measuring Q=-1.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the combined probability of both events happening. So, the total probability is the probability of getting P=0 multiplied by the probability of getting Q=-1 given that P was 0, right? Because the second measurement is conditional on the first.

But wait, let me think again. The first measurement is P, so the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, the second measurement of Q is done on that state. So the probability is the product of the probability of P=
