Okay, so I've got this question about barley and some gene mutations. Hmm, I remember that EMS is a mutagen that typically causes point mutations. The question is about which mutation would eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. So, the gene responsible has five exons and four introns, and the mutations are in the first exon area.

Looking at the sequences, the wild type starts with ATGTTTCTC... and the mutants have changes there. I need to figure out which mutation would disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant amino acid change.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence.

Mutant 1: The sequence changes from TTTCTCG to TTCTACG. Wait, let me count the nucleotides. The wild type first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So in Mutant 1, the third codon is TTT, which is Phe. Then CTC becomes CTA? Wait, the original is CTC GCT. So in mutant 1, the CTC is replaced with CTA? Wait, wait, let me see the exact sequences.

Wild type: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA
Wait no, I think I got that wrong. Let me compare each segment.

Looking at the beginning:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT A GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA
Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write each codon.

Wild type:
ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg) …

Mutant 1:
ATG (same)
TTT (same)
CTA (Leu) — Oh wait, wait. No, let's see the exact letters. Oh wait, the original looks like:

Wild: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Wait, let's break it down:

Wild type starts: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1 starts: ATG TTT CTA GCT GGT ACT...

So the third codon is CTC in wild (Leu), and CTA in Mutant1 (Leu). So that's a silent mutation, same amino acid. Next codon in wild is GCT (Ala), in Mutant1 it's GCT as well. Wait, no, let me look again.

Wait the wild type is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGA... So the first exons are these 5' sequences.

Mutant1's sequence: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

So, the third codon in wild is CTC (Leu). In Mutant1, the third codon is CTA (Leu) as well. But wait, looking at the fourth codon: wild is GCT (Ala), mutant1 seems to have GCT as well. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant1, the change is in the second codon.

Wait, the wild type's second codon is TTT. In Mutant1, the second codon is TCT? Let me check the sequences again.

Wait, the wild sequence is:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1's sequence is:
ATG TTT CT A GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, perhaps the second codon is same, third is different.

Wait, original is ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant1 is ATG TTT CTA GCT...

So, the third codon in wild is CTC (Leu), mutant1 is CTA (Leu). So same amino acid, no change. Fourth codon in wild is GCT (Ala). In mutant1, it's GCT as well. So same. Hmm, but wait, the fifth codon in wild is GGT (Gly), in mutant1 it's GGT same. Wait, but maybe the change is in the sixth codon?

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let's look at the exact sequences.

Wild: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1:5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing each nucleotide:

Wild: positions 3-5: TTT
Mutant1: positions 3-5: TCT (so TTT becomes TCT, which is Ser instead of Phe. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me count the letters.

The first part of wild is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... So breaking it down:

Positions 1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: CTC (Leu)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
25-27: GAT (Asp)
26-28: GAA (Glu)
etc.

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

So, positions 4-6: TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe). So that's a change from Phe to Ser at position 2? Or wait, the first codon is ATG (position 1-3), then TTT (positions 4-6), then CTC (7-9), etc.

In mutant1, the second codon (positions 4-6) is TCT, which is Ser. So that's a mutation from Phe to Ser at the second amino acid.

So the protein would have Ser instead of Phe. Not necessarily a big deal, but maybe not a stop codon. So this is a missense mutation, but not a truncation.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild type, which is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Wild: positions 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT.

Mutant2: positions 4-6: TCT (Ser), 7-9: GCT (Ala?), wait, let me see.

Wait, mutant2's sequence from 4-12: TCT AAG C.

Wait, so codons 2 is TCT (Ser), codon3 is AAG (Lys), codon4 is C (wait, but it's a triplet. Hmm, wait, the sequence is ATG TTT CT AAG C... Wait, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly. Let me write the first part:

Wild: positions 1-12: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT

Mutant2: positions 1-12: ATG TCT AAG C ...

Wait, perhaps in mutant2, after the ATG, the next codons are TCT, then maybe AAG, etc. So:

Mutant2's sequence starts with ATG TCT AAG C... So, codon 2 is TCT (Ser), codon3 is AAG (Lys), codon4 is GCT (Ala) in wild. Wait, but in mutant2, codon4 is C? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the change is in the intron? But all the mutations are in the first exon. Wait, the question says the changes are in the first exon area, so all are in exons.

Alternatively, maybe looking for a nonsense mutation, which introduces a stop codon. Let's check for any mutations that introduce a TAA, TAG, or TAG in the reading frame.

Looking at Mutant3:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

So, let me look for the codons.

In wild, the third codon is CTC (Leu), and fourth is GCT (Ala). In Mutant3, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), and the fourth is GCT (Ala). Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, the mutant3 sequence is: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Wait, from the beginning:

- ATG (start)
- TTT (Phe)
- TAC (Tyr) — so that's the third codon, changed from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). So position 3 is now Tyr instead of Leu. Then GCT (Ala), same as wild.

Then GGT (Gly) same, then ACT (Thr) same. Next codon is TCT (Ser) same. Then GTG (Val) same, GAT (Asp) same, GAA (Glu) same, etc.

So that's a missense, not leading to a stop.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the beginning: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...

So, first codon is ATG, second is TTT (Phe), third is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is ACT (Thr), sixth is TCT (Ser).

Wait, but the wild type after the third codon is GCT, GGT, etc. So in mutant4, the fourth codon is GCT, fifth is ACT (Thr), but the sixth is TCT (Ser). Wait, perhaps the fifth codon is a different one.

Wait, perhaps the change is more extensive. Let me compare.

Wild: ... GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant4: ... GCT ACT TCT GTG ...

Wait, so the fifth codon in wild is GGT (Gly), but in mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). Oh wait, perhaps after the third codon, which is TAC, the next codons are GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, the fourth codon in wild is GCT (Ala), same as mutant4. Then fifth codon in wild is GGT (Gly), but in mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So that's a change from Gly to Thr.

But that doesn't immediately cause a stop codon.

Wait, but perhaps there's a frameshift? Let me check the lengths.

Looking at the sequences, all the mutants seem to have the same length as the wild type. So no frameshift, probably a substitution.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake. Let me count the number of nucleotides.

Wild type: each codon is 3 nt. The wild type as written is much longer, but the key is to see if any of the mutations introduce a stop codon.

Looking at the options, the question is which mutation would let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So likely, disrupting the gene's function by causing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) would be best.

So, which mutant introduces a stop codon in the reading frame?

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: Second codon is TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe). No stop.

Mutant2: let me see. The sequence is ATG TCT AAG C... So, the second codon is TCT (Ser), third is AAG (Lys). Then what? The fourth codon would be CTT (Leu), perhaps.

Wait, let me parse the sequence correctly.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

ATG (1-3), TCT (4-6), AAG (7-9), CTT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24), etc.

So, the third codon is AAG (Lys), which is fine. No stop codons here.

Mutant3: The third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is GGT (Gly). No stop codon.

Mutant4: Let me check.

Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Breaking into codons:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TAC (7-9), GCT (10-12), ACT (13-15), TCT (16-18), GTG (19-21), etc.

So, third codon is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is ACT (Thr). No stop codons.

Wait, but none of the mutants introduce a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the coding sequence. Hmm.

Wait, but let me check the end of the wild type sequence. The wild type ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So perhaps in the mutants, the stop codon is still present.

Wait, but the question is about a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. So the gene is functional, making the compound. We want to disrupt it.

If the mutation causes a frameshift, it could lead to a premature stop. But the question says EMS is used. EMS typically induces point mutations, not frameshifts. So all the mutations are substitutions.

Wait, perhaps the mutation creates a new stop codon earlier. Let me check each mutation to see if any of the codons become a stop.

Looking again:

Mutant1's second codon is TCT (Ser), others are same. No stop.

Mutant2: codons are ATG, TCT, AAG, CTT, etc. No stop.

Mutant3: codons are ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT, GGT, ACT, etc. No stop.

Mutant4: codons are ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, etc. No stop.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's look more carefully.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the fifth codon is ACT (Thr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), etc. No stop.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Maybe the mutation disrupts the enzyme's active site, leading to non-functional compound. But that's more about missense mutations leading to loss of function, which may not always eliminate the compound.

Alternatively, maybe one of the mutations introduces a premature stop codon. Let me check the sequences again.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, in the middle, after TAC GCT, the next codon is ACT (Thr). Then TCT (Ser). So no stop there.

Wait, maybe the end of the sequence? The wild type ends with TGA, which is a stop. So all the mutants have TGA at the end. So the stop codon is still there. So not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in a regulatory region, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon, which is part of the coding region.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The gene is five exons. So the first exon is probably the beginning of the coding sequence. So any mutation in the first exon that disrupts the start codon or causes a frameshift would be bad.

But all the mutations are point changes.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation occurs early, leading to a truncated protein. Let me check if any of the mutants have a stop codon in the beginning.

Looking again:

Wild type starts with ATG (start), then TTT, CTC, etc.

Mutant1: ATG TCT (second codon), no stop.

Mutant2: ATG TCT, third codon AAG (no stop).

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC (no stop).

Mutant4: same as wild start, except third codon TAC.

Wait, unless the mutation introduces a stop codon within the exon.

Wait, let me check each mutant's sequence for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Mutant1: Looking at each triplet:

ATG, TCT, CTA, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATT, TAT, TGT, CGC, TGA.

CGC is a codon for Arg, and TGA is the stop. So in the wild type, the stop is at the end. In Mutant1, the last codon is CGC, then TGA. So no earlier stop.

Mutant2: ...

ATG, TCT, AAG, CTT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATT, TAT, TGT, CGC, TGA.

No stop before the end.

Mutant3: same as wild, no new stop.

Mutant4: same, third codon TAC (Tyr), rest same as wild.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the exons. Each exon is a segment of the gene that's transcribed and translated. The introns are spliced out.

But all the mutations are in the first exon. So perhaps the mutation doesn't affect the reading frame but changes the protein enough to stop the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, the question is about which mutation will most probably eliminate the compound. That would be if the mutation disrupts the gene's function, either by a premature stop or by a critical amino acid change.

Another possibility is that one of the mutations disrupts a critical region of the protein, such as the active site. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations deletes a segment. Wait, no, all the mutants have the same length as wild type.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a change that creates a stop codon within the coding region.

Wait, looking again:

Mutant1's sequence:

ATG TTT CTA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA.

Wait, the last codon before TGA is CGC (Arg), then TGA. So no stop before.

Mutant2: ... CGC TGA. Same as wild.

Mutant3: ... CGT TGA. So, no stop codon introduced.

Mutant4: ends with CGT TGA as well.

Wait, perhaps none of the mutations introduce a premature stop. Then why would the anti-nutritional compound be eliminated?

Maybe the mutation is in a regulatory region. But the question says the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon, so it's in the coding region.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations is a nonsense mutation that causes a stop early, but I didn't spot it.

Wait, let me go back to each mutant.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking into codons:

1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: TAC
10-12: GCT
13-15: ACT
16-18: TCT
19-21: GTG
22-24: GAT
23-25: GAA
26-28: CAT
29-31: ATT
30-32: TAT
33-35: TGT
36-38: CGT
39: TGA.

No, no stop codon anywhere in the middle.

Wait, perhaps looking for a frameshift. But the sequences are all the same length as the wild type, so no.

Wait, perhaps one of the mutations changes a critical nucleotide that disrupts the protein function. Like a change in the start codon.

The start codon is ATG. In all mutants, the first codon is ATG. So that's okay.

Hmm, perhaps the question is more about which mutation would disrupt the synthesis of the compound, perhaps by disrupting the gene's function. So perhaps a nonsense mutation in an early exon would cause a truncated protein, which may not function.

Wait, looking at the sequences again, perhaps I missed a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant3, the fifth codon is GTC instead of GGT. Let me see.

Mutant3's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

So, codon 5 is GTC (Val) instead of GGT (Gly). Not a stop.

Wait, perhaps the fourth codon in Mutant4 is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). But that's a missense, not a stop.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mutation that creates a stop codon earlier. Let me see if any of the triplets in the mutants are TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Mutant1: third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is GGT (Gly). No stop.

Mutant2: third codon is AAG (Lys), fourth is CTT (Leu). No stop.

Mutant3: third codon TAC (Tyr), fourth GCT (Ala), fifth GGT (Gly). No stop.

Mutant4: third TAC, fourth GCT, fifth ACT. No stop.

Wait, perhaps looking at the middle of the sequence.

Wild type continues after the initial part as ... TGT CGT ... which is Cys and Arg.

Mutant1: ... TGT CGC ... CGC is Arg, no stop.

Mutant2: ... TGT CGC ... same.

Mutant3: ... TGT CGT ... same as wild.

Mutant4: same as wild.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to look for the mutation that introduces a stop codon. Since all the mutations don't introduce a stop, perhaps the best bet is to find a missense mutation in a critical region. But without knowing the protein's structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which has a change in the fourth and fifth codons. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the question says that the target gene is sequenced in the first exon area. So the earliest possible mutation would have the most drastic effect, perhaps causing a frameshift or a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reading frame. Let's think about the reading frame. All mutations are point substitutions, so the reading frame remains the same. So the only way to get a stop codon is by a mutation that creates a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the same reading frame.

Looking again:

Wild type first exons: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

So, looking at the third codon: CTC becomes CTA. So Leu to Leu. No change.

Fourth codon: same GCT. No change.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CT AAG C...

So, the second codon is TCT (Ser), third codon is AAG (Lys). Fourth codon would be CTT (Leu). No stop.

Mutant3: third codon TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). No stop.

Mutant4: third codon TAC, fourth GCT, fifth ACT (Thr). No stop.

Wait, maybe another approach: the question is about which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Perhaps the correct answer is the one where the gene is non-functional. So perhaps a nonsense mutation in an earlier exon.

Wait, perhaps looking for a mutation that introduces a stop codon early. Let's check each mutant for any TGA, TAG, or TAA codons in the middle.

Wild type has TGA at the end.

Mutant1: CGC TGA.

Mutant2: CGC TGA.

Mutant3: CGT TGA.

Mutant4: CGT TGA.

No, no early stops.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reading frame. Let me make sure that I'm reading the sequences correctly.

Each gene sequence is given as a single strand, 5'->3', so the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand. Wait, but in the question, the given sequences are the coding (sense) strands, right?

Wait, the gene is DNA, so the mRNA would be synthesized from the complementary strand. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mRNA codons are in the same reading frame but complementary to the DNA.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.

The given DNA sequences are the coding strands (non-template), so the mRNA would be identical to the coding strand, except T replaced by U.

So, for each codon in the DNA, the mRNA codon is the same, except T becomes U.

So, the DNA sequence given is the same as the mRNA, with T's.

So, for example, the DNA codon ATG becomes AUC in mRNA, which is the start codon.

So, when looking for stop codons in the mRNA, which are UAA, UAG, UGA.

So, looking for these in the mRNA.

Wild type DNA sequence: ... TGT CGT ... TGA.

In mRNA, that would be ... UGT CGU ... UGA.

So, the last codon is UGA, which is a stop.

So, in the DNA, the last triplet before TGA is CGT, which in mRNA is CGU, then UGA.

So, in the mutants, their last triplet is CGC (Mutant1 and 2), CGT (Mutant3 and 4). So their mRNA ends with CGU or CGA, then UGA.

No early stops.

Wait, but perhaps one of the mutations creates a stop codon in the middle.

Looking at Mutant4's DNA sequence: ... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

In mRNA, this would be ... UAC GCU ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the codons are UAC (Tyr), GCU (Ala), ACT (Thr), etc. No stop.

Mutant1: ... CTA GCT GGT ACT ... → CTA (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly). No stop.

Mutant2: ... AAG CTT GGT ... → AAG (Lys), CTT (Leu), GGT (Gly). No stop.

Mutant3: ... TAC GCT GGT ... → same as wild.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a stop codon somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, a codon becomes UAG. Let's see.

Mutant4's DNA sequence: ... TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, in mRNA, it's UAC GCU ACT TCT GTG GAT.

No UAG or UAA or UGA except at the end.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about which mutation leads to the most drastic change in the protein.

Mutant 4's DNA changes are more extensive. Let's see:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

So, the first three codons are same (ATG, TTT), then the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Fourth codon is GCT (Ala) same. Then fifth codon is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, Gly becomes Thr.

That's two amino acid changes. Maybe disrupting the structure.

But which of the options is the best? The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, perhaps any mutation that disrupts the gene's function. But without knowing which mutation disrupts it, I need to find which one is most likely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon earlier in the sequence, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a frameshift, but all sequences have the same length. So no.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is Mutant4, option D.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation leads to a frameshift, but the sequences are same length. So no.

Alternatively, perhaps the gene's function is disrupted by a change in the start codon. But all start with ATG, so that's same.

Wait, I think I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant3

C) Mutant1

D) Mutant4

The question is which mutation will most probably eliminate the compound. I think the best chance is a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon. But none of the mutants do that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake looking for stop codons. Let me check again.

Mutant1's mRNA:

... TGT CGC UGA ...

So, the last codon is UGA (stop). So in the DNA, it's TGA. So, same as wild, no early stop.

Mutant2: same as wild.

Mutant3: same as wild.

Mutant4: same.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in the first exon, but the change is in a splice site. But the question says the changes are in the exon area, so probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter region, but the changes are in the first exon, which is coding.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the answer based on other factors.

Wait, another approach: the question says the compound makes the barley unsuitable for food. So the gene makes the compound. If we can disrupt the gene, the compound won't be made.

So, the best way is to disrupt the gene's function. A nonsense mutation leading to a truncated protein is a good way.

Looking again, perhaps I missed a stop codon in one of the mutants.

Wait, in Mutant4, the sequence is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

So the mRNA would be:

AUG UUU UAC GCU ACU TCT GTG GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGA … UGA.

Wait, wait, CGT in DNA is CGA in mRNA. So the last codons are CGA (Arg) and then UGA (stop).

No stop in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mutation might have caused an alternative stop codon earlier.

Wait, perhaps the fifth codon in Mutant4 is ACT (Thr) in mRNA, which is ACU.

No, that's not a stop.

Hmm. I'm running out of ideas. Maybe the correct answer is Mutant 4, which changes the structure of the protein in a way that the anti-nutritional compound isn't produced.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations disrupts a key region of the gene, like the promoter, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2, which changes the second codon to Ser and introduces a third codon as Lys. But that doesn't introduce a stop.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant2, a codon becomes TAG, which is a stop. Let me check.

Mutant2's DNA sequence: ... TCT AAG CTT GGT ...

In mRNA, that's ... UCA AGA CUU GGU ...

So, the second codon is UCA (Ser), third is AGA (Arg), fourth is CUU (Leu). No stop.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes the third codon to CTA (Leu) and the fourth codon is GCT (Ala). No stop.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1 because the mutation introduces a Leu instead of Leu, but that's the same. No.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4. Let me consider why.

In Mutant4, after the third codon (TAC), the fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). Gly is often in structural regions, so changing to Thr might disrupt the protein's structure significantly, leading to loss of function.

So, perhaps Mutant4's change is in a critical region, leading to non-function.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2. Let me see.

Mutant2's second codon is TCT (Ser), third is AAG (Lys). AAG is a positively charged amino acid, whereas the wild type's third codon is CTC (Leu), which is hydrophobic. So this change could disrupt the protein's structure.

But without knowing the exact function, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which has an additional base change that creates a stop codon. But I don't see that.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I'll have to make an educated guess.

The question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutations are in the first exon. So the first exon is the beginning of the coding sequence.

If a mutation in the first exon creates a stop codon early, that would be good. But none of the mutants do that.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation in the first exon disrupts the start codon or the initial coding region.

But all the mutants have ATG as the first codon.

So, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which changes the third codon to TAC (Tyr) and the fifth codon to ACT (Thr) instead of Gly.

This change might disrupt the protein's function. So the answer is D) Mutant4.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or by significantly altering the protein's structure (missense mutation).

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Wild Type Sequence**:
   - `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA`
   - The sequence starts with `ATG` (start codon) and ends with `TGA` (stop codon).

2. **Mutant 1**:
   - `ATG TTT CTA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA`
   - The second codon remains `TTT` (Phe), and the third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `CTA` (Leu). This is a silent mutation (no change in amino acid).
   - No premature stop codon is introduced.

3. **Mutant 2**:
   - `ATG TCT AAG CTT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA`
   - The second codon changes from `TTT` (Phe) to `TCT` (Ser), and the third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `AAG` (Lys). These are missense mutations, but no premature stop codon is introduced.

4. **Mutant 3**:
   - `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA`
   - The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr), and the fifth codon changes from `GGT` (Gly) to `GTC` (Val). These are missense mutations, but no premature stop codon is introduced.

5. **Mutant 4**:
   - `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA`
   - The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr), and the fifth codon changes from `GGT` (Gly) to `ACT` (Thr). These are missense mutations. The change from Gly to Thr could disrupt the protein's structure significantly, potentially leading to a loss of function.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) in the coding sequence. However, Mutant 4 introduces two amino acid changes that could disrupt the protein's structure or function. Among the options, Mutant 4 is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by disrupting the gene's function.
