Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, let me think. The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state when it absorbs the photon. The molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, specifically the non-rigid rotor model. 

Alright, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule combine both rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (J=0). When the molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next higher state. But wait, the next lowest energy state—oh right, that would be the next state. So we need to consider the possible transitions.

Wait, the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is initially in its fundamental state, which is the lowest possible (v=0, J=0). The next state could either be a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But because the vibrational energy levels are more spaced out than rotational ones, the energy required to transition to the next vibrational level is higher than moving to a higher rotational level. So I think the next lowest state would be the first rotational state (J=1) if that's allowed.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia
