Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, rightâ€”that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to different optical properties. So, they must have chiral centers or some kind of stereogenic elements.

The question lists four compounds, 1 to 4, and I need to determine which exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining different numbers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, biphenyl structures can have different isomerism. Wait, this has substituents on the benzene rings. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring, with nitriles perhaps? Wait, no, it's dinitro so nitro groups. So, the structure is like two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', and on each ring, at positions 2 and 6, there are nitro groups. Also, the carboxylate groups are attached. Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions as well.

Wait, biphenyl compounds can have different conformations, but optical isomerism usually comes from stereogenic centers. But in this case, is there a chiral center? The molecule has two benzene rings connected, but are there any asymmetric centers here? Let me think. The substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing, but does that create any chirality? The central bond between the two rings is single, so it can rotate. Wait, for biphenyls, if there are substituents in such a way that the mirror image isn't superimposable, could that lead to optical isomerism? But wait, biphenyls usually have atropisomerism when the rings are too hindered to rotate, leading to different conformations. But atropisomers are a type of stereoisomer, but not optical isomers unless they have a chiral center.

Wait, maybe this compound doesn't have a chiral center. Because the substituents are symmetrical? Let me see. Both rings have nitro groups at 6 and 2 positions. If the substituents are in positions that
