Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me break it down.

The question is about a synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts, roughly equal integrals adding up to 1H. So, it's not like it's integrating to 2H or something else. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling because if that were the case, the splitting would be more complicated, like each peak having multiple splits. But here, the peaks are just two, same shift, same integral, so maybe it's not coupling but something else.

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So, same mass, same retention time? Wait, no—wait, the LC-MS was done at elevated temperature. Hmm, maybe the peaks are from different compounds but same mass? Or maybe the same compound in different conformations?

Wait, same mass—so same molecular weight. So, the same molecule. So, what's causing two peaks in LC-MS? Maybe isomerism? Like, diastereomers or enantiomers. But in LC-MS, especially if it's a high-resolution method, how would that split?

Wait, in LC, enantiomers would typically have the same retention time if the column doesn't have chiral selectivity. But if the column is chiral, enantiomers would separate. But if the LC showed two peaks of same mass, maybe they're diastereomers. Or maybe the compound is a racemic mixture, but on a normal LC column, they wouldn't separate—so the same peak would be observed. Unless the problem says the LC was run on a chiral column, which it doesn't. So, perhaps it's not about enantiomers.

Wait, but the question says LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. So same mass, same retention time? Or different retention times? Oh, I think the question says two peaks—so different retention times. But same mass, so same m/z. So same molecular weight, but different structures. So how?

Another possibility: the compound is a mixture of diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC and have different NMR spectra, but here the NMR shows same shifts for the alpha-proton except for duplication. Wait, but wait, the NMR is from the crude sample. So in the crude, perhaps the product is a mixture of two diastereomers. If so, then in the NMR, each diastereomer would have its own set of protons. But in the question, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, same shift, same integral. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a mixture of two enantiomers. Then, the NMR would show the same peaks, because enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. So why would there be two peaks for the same proton? That doesn't fit. Because if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would look the same as a pure sample. So the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton
