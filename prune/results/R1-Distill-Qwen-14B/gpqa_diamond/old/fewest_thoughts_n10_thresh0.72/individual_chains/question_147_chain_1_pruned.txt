Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I've heard a bit about particle physics before, but I'm not exactly an expert. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is about the annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide and produce two A+ and two A- particles. So the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. The given data is that the antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving," so maybe it's moving at a velocity much less than the speed of light. Alternatively, perhaps it's that the system is such that the total energy is dominated by rest mass. Not sure yet.

The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. I'm trying to remember what the masses of protons and antiprotons are. Oh right, the proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², same as the antiproton because they are matter and antimatter. So each proton and antiproton is about 938 MeV each. So the total rest mass before the collision is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.

After the collision, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV, so four times 300 is 1200 MeV. So the total rest mass after is 1200 MeV. Wait, but that's less than the initial rest mass. So that would imply that the process is not possible under conservation of energy unless considering kinetic energy. Oh, wait, but in reality, in annihilation processes, energy is converted into other forms, but here the products are particles with lower combined rest mass, so perhaps some kinetic energy is involved.

Wait, but wait. The problem probably assumes that all the energy goes into the rest mass of the products and any kinetic energy. Or maybe since the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is asking about the velocity of particle A. So perhaps we can use conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me think. The initial system has a proton at rest and an antiproton moving slowly. Let me clarify:
