Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially for two-dimensional problems, it's helpful to use polar coordinates because the potential might have some symmetry.

Wait, the potential here has two terms. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Oh, right, cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2, right? So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me compute that.

So, simplifying: the second term becomes (3/2) * (1/2) kr² (1 + cos2θ) = (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ). So the entire potential is (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Wait, combining the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, that doesn't look familiar. Hmm, perhaps I should think about this in terms of effective potentials or maybe separate the radial and angular parts. Maybe I can write this in terms of r and some other function.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because, in two dimensions, sometimes it's easier to switch to x and y. Let me think: r² = x² + y², and cos2θ would be (x² - y²)/(r²). So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) k (x² - y²).

Hmm, that's interesting. Let's expand that. So (
