Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and a calibration curve. Hmm, I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of DNA or RNA in a sample. The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers, right? He did serial dilutions and ran three technical replicates for each.

The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. So, the efficiency formula (E = 100% - slope * 3.31) would give E=100% here since slope is -3.3, and 3.3*3.31 is around 11, but maybe that's not important right now.

The R² is 1, which indicates a perfect linear relationship. That's good because it means the calibration curve is accurate. So, the main issue must be with the Ct values given in the data.

Looking at the Ct values: for each dilution, there are three technical replicates. Let's check the ranges. 

At 100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is around 34.2. Similarly, 10,000 is around 30.9. 1,000 is 27.6, 100 is 24.3, and 10 is 21.0.

Wait, the Ct values are decreasing as the concentration decreases. That makes sense because higher starting DNA means fewer cycles to reach the threshold. So that's correct.

But the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options suggest possible issues.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But since he got a perfect R², that can't be right. So A is wrong.

Option B says Ct values don't correlate with target amount. But R² is 1, so the Ct and copy number are perfectly correlated. So B is incorrect.

Option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, in a perfect 100% efficient qPCR, a ten-fold dilution should change Ct by about 1 cycle. Because each ten-fold reduces copies by 10, so it takes one more cycle to amplify to the same point. So if the slope is -3.3, that suggests that each ten-fold decrease increases Ct by 3.3. But that contradicts expectation because a ten-fold should only change Ct by 1. If the efficiency is 100%, then each cycle doubles the product. So the formula is Ct = log10(initial copies) * (1 / efficiency factor) + intercept. Wait, with 100% efficiency, the efficiency factor is 1 (since E=1, so log(1)=0, so it's simply the log of copies. Or maybe the equation is slope = log10(E) / efficiency, but I might be mixing up formulas.

Wait, I think the standard formula for the slope in a qPCR calibration curve is calculated using the formula: y = mx + b, where y is Ct, x is log10 of copies, and
