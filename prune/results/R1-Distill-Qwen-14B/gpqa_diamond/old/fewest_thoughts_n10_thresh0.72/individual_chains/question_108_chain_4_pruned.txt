Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism is related to the magnetic properties of materials, involving electron spins. 

The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis here. The values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number) are small, so maybe m=0 or ±1? And the magnetic field strength is 1 Tesla. 

The problem asks me to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, where the wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers. I remember that the 0.486 micrometer wavelength is in the visible range, probably corresponding to a specific spectral line of hydrogen. Oh right, that's the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is a transition between n=3 and n=2, emitting a photon in the visible spectrum.

So first, I need to calculate the transition energy ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the formula E_n = - (13.6 eV) / n². The transition from n=3 to n=2 would be ΔE = E_2 - E_3. Wait, no, ΔE should be the energy difference when moving from a higher to lower state, so it's E_initial - E_final. Or wait, when the electron drops from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference. So ΔE for n=3 → n=2 is E_2 - E_3.

Wait, E_n is negative, so E_3 is more negative than E_2? No wait, E_3 = -13.6/(3)^2 = -1.511 eV, and E_2 = -13.6/(2)^2 = -3.4 eV. Wait no, that's not right. Let me compute E_2 and E_3 correctly.

E_2 = -13.6 eV / (2)^2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV.

E_3 = -13.6 eV / (3)^2 = -13.6 /9 ≈ -1.511 eV.

So the transition from n=3 to n=2 would have ΔE = E_2 - E_3? Wait, no, because when the electron transitions from higher to lower energy level (from n=3 to n=2), the energy emitted is the difference: E_initial (n=3) is higher than E_final (n=2), so ΔE = E_final - E_initial = E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) )= -1.889 eV. But wait, the energy of the photon emitted is the absolute value, so 1.889 eV. Alternatively, the transition energy ΔE is 1.889 eV.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it using the wavelength given, since sometimes the formula
