Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused because I missed the lecture on this topic. Let's try to think this through step by step.

The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions—basic and acidic. The statement is incomplete, and we need to fill in the blanks with the correct terms from the options given.

The first part is about thermodynamics. It says, "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." I remember that thermodynamic factors relate to the spontaneity of a reaction. The standard reduction potential (E°) determines if a reaction is spontaneous. A higher E° means a stronger oxidizing agent.

Oxygen is a strong oxidant in basic solutions because the reaction O2 + 2 H2O + 4 e^- → 4 OH^- has a high E°. I think its E° is around +0.40 V under basic conditions. In acidic solutions, the reaction is O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e^- → 2 H2O, with an E° around +1.23 V. So in acidic, oxygen is a stronger oxidant. But wait, the question is about basic solutions here. So in basic, oxygen is a strong oxidant. So the first blank should be "stronger".

Now the second part is kinetic. "Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." Kinetics has to do with the rate of reaction. The reaction in acidic solution might have a higher rate because of factors like concentration of H+ ions, which can act as catalysts or stabilize transition states.

Wait, but why would acidic solutions make it react faster? Maybe in acidic conditions, the reaction is more favorable kinetically. Or perhaps because the activation energy is lower. Alternatively, in basic solutions, maybe the solution's high pH slows down the reaction because of OH- ions interfering, or maybe because of the presence of other ions that cause overpotential.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of O2 as an oxidizing agent involves electron transfer. In acidic solutions, the presence of H+ ions might facilitate the reaction. For example, in an acidic medium, the O2 molecule is more likely to dissolve and react quickly because H+ can help in the protonation steps during the reaction mechanism.

Wait, but I also recall that in acidic solutions, even though E° is higher, sometimes the reaction might not proceed as quickly because of other factors. Like, maybe in basic solutions, the reaction has a higher rate because of the ions present. Or wait, maybe the opposite. Let me think about the kinetics. The reaction rate depends on the concentration of ions involved in the rate-determining step.

Another angle: the rate of oxygen reduction in solution. In acidic solution, with H+ ions, perhaps the reaction has a lower activation energy. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is faster because of the higher concentration of H+ ions, but wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. The Nernst equation tells us about the thermodynamic favorability, but the kinetics is about the rate. For the same reaction, the activation energy could be lower in certain conditions. For oxygen in acidic vs basic...

I remember that in acidic conditions, the reaction might have a lower overpotential. Oh wait, overpotential is the difference between the theoretical electrode potential and the actual potential needed for the reaction to occur. Lower overpotential means the reaction is easier to occur, hence faster.

In basic solutions, the overpotential for oxygen reduction is higher than in acidic. So in acidic, the reaction occurs faster because the overpotential is lower. That would mean kinetically, in acidic solutions, oxygen reacts faster.

So putting it together: thermodynamically, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions (because E° is positive, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the E° for the basic solution is lower than the acidic one. So in basic, the E° is lower, but perhaps the question is about whether it's a stronger oxidant in that specific solution. So in basic, the O2 has a higher oxidizing strength than in acidic? Or is the acidic solution where it's stronger?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me clarify:

The standard reduction potentials (E°) for the O2 reactions are:
- In acidic: O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, E° = +1.23 V
- In basic: O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-, E° = +0.40 V

So in acidic, the E° is higher, meaning O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent in acidic solution. But the first part of the question says "in basic solutions", so in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant compared to acidic conditions. Wait, but the question says "thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So the blank is about the strength in basic—so compared to other conditions, but the statement is about the intrinsic strength in basic.

Wait, maybe the question is comparing the same reaction in different pH conditions. So in basic solution, O2 is a stronger oxidant than in acidic? No, because in acidic, its E° is higher, so it's a stronger oxidant in acidic.

Wait, but the first part is about whether it's a stronger/weak oxidant in basic. So the answer is that in basic, it's a stronger oxidant than in some other condition? Or is it weaker than in acidic? Hmm.

Wait, the statement is about "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So the blank is about the strength of O2 as an oxidant in basic. The options are stronger or weaker. But compared to what? Maybe compared to another oxidant in the same solution.

Wait, perhaps the question is about comparing the same reaction in different solutions. So in basic solution, the oxidizing strength is stronger or weaker than in acidic. Since in acidic, E° is higher (1.23 vs 0.40), that would mean O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic than in basic. So in basic, it's weaker.

Wait, but the question says "oxygen is a ….. oxidant in basic solutions." So in basic, it's a weaker oxidant than it is in acidic. So the correct term would be weaker.

But wait, the first part is about thermodynamic strength. So the first blank is 'weaker' because in basic, its E° is lower than in acidic. So then the first part is 'weaker'.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So in basic solutions, its oxidizing ability is weaker than in acidic. So the blank should be 'weaker'.

But earlier when I thought about the E°, in basic, E° is 0.40 V, which is lower than 1.23 V in acidic. So in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant.

So the first part: weaker.

Now the second part: kinetically, in acidic solutions, O2 reacts faster or slower.

Earlier, I thought that in acidic, the overpotential is lower, so reaction is faster. So kinetically, in acidic, O2 reacts faster. So the blank would be 'faster'.

Putting it all together: the blanks are 'weaker' and 'faster'. So looking at the options:

Option C: weaker – faster

Option D: weaker - slower

Wait, no. Let's check the options again.

Options:
A) stronger – faster
B) stronger – slower
C) weaker – faster
D) weaker - slower

So option C is weaker and faster. So that would mean the first blank is 'weaker' and the second is 'faster'.

So the correct combination is weaker and faster.

Wait, but wait another thought. The question is about the kinetic aspect in acidic. So the rate of reaction in acidic conditions.

In acidic solution, the reaction O2 + 4 H+ + 4e^- → 2 H2O might proceed faster because in acidic, the solution has more H+ ions which can help in the reaction steps. Alternatively, in basic solutions, maybe the OH- ions interfere with the reaction, making it slower.

Alternatively, the rate of the reaction depends on the concentration of H+ in acidic solutions, which could be higher, but wait, in the rate-determining step, perhaps H+ is a catalyst. So higher H+ would increase the rate, meaning the reaction is faster in acidic.

So the combination is weaker (thermodynamic) in basic, and faster (kinetic) in acidic.

So the correct option is C) weaker – faster.


The question involves analyzing the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, focusing on thermodynamic and kinetic factors. 

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**:  
   The standard reduction potentials for oxygen in different solutions are:  
   - In acidic: \( \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}, \, E^\circ = +1.23 \, \text{V} \)  
   - In basic: \( \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-, \, E^\circ = +0.40 \, \text{V} \)  

   Since the standard reduction potential (\( E^\circ \)) is higher in acidic solutions, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic conditions. In basic solutions, oxygen is therefore a weaker oxidant. Thus, the first blank should be filled with "weaker."

2. **Kinetic Analysis**:  
   Kinetics refers to the rate of reaction. In acidic solutions, the presence of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions can lower the overpotential, making the reaction proceed faster. Additionally, \( \text{H}^+ \) ions may facilitate the reaction mechanism by stabilizing intermediates or participating in the rate-determining step. In contrast, in basic solutions, \( \text{OH}^- \) ions may hinder the reaction, leading to a slower rate. Therefore, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions, and the second blank should be filled with "faster."

3. **Combining Results**:  
   The correct combination is "weaker – faster," which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
