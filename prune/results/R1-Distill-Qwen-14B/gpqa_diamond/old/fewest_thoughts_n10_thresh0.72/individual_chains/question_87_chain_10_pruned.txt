Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. And the total is 8 carbon atoms. Hmm. So the aromatic ring is benzene, which is 6 carbons. So the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Di-substituted, so two groups attached to the benzene.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). So the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait: the substituents would each add to the ring. Let me think about possible groups. If one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like maybe an ester, ketone, or something like that. The other substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, etc.

Wait, but the total carbon count is 8. Benzene is 6 carbons. So substituents add 2 carbons in total. Oh wait, wait: di-substituted, so two substituents. If each substituent has a certain number of carbons. Let me think: for example, one substituent is -COOR (like an ester, which would have 2 carbons: R is an ethyl group, but wait, wait, let me think about the carbons in substituents.

Wait, the total carbons in the molecule are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents contribute 2. So each substituent must be a single carbon group. Because two substituents, each with one carbon, sum to 2. Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other zero? No, because they are substituents on the ring, so each has at least one carbon. Wait, no, substituents can be like -X (halogens, which are substituents with zero carbons). Oh, wait, that's a possibility. So if one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br), which is a single substituent with no carbons, and the other substituent is a carbonyl with one carbon. Let me think: what's a carbonyl group with one carbon? Like a ket
