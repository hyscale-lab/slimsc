Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the steps, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. The goal is to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Also, I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different volume and pH values.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and can react with a strong acid like HCl. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Right? So the acid will protonate the hydroxide ions, eventually dissolving the Fe(OH)3.

I think the first step is to calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... wait, Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is 17.01 g/mol, so three OHs would be 51.03. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol approximately. 

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 106.88 is roughly 0.000936 moles, or 9.36e-4 mol.

The reaction equation is 1 mole Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles HCl. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of HCl. So moles of HCl needed = 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 mol.

Now, the HCl solution is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter, so volume (L) = moles / Molarity. So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options have 28.05 cm³ as option C. That's really close, so maybe that's the volume. But wait, is that the minimum volume?

Wait a second, maybe I should consider that Fe(OH)3 might not completely dissolve, or perhaps there is some excess HCl required beyond just stoichiometry. Oh wait, no, the question asks for the minimum volume needed to prepare the solution, so it's just the stoichiometric amount. So 28.08 cm³ is approximately 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm³. That's very close. So perhaps the correct volume is around 28 cm³. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the molar mass. Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). So Fe: 55.845, each OH is 17.007 (16 + 1.007). So 3 * 17.007 = 51.021. So total molar mass is 55.845 + 51.021 = 106.866 g/mol. So 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 0.1 / 106.866 ≈ 0.0009357 mol. So 3 times that is 0.002807 mol. Divided by 0.1 M is 28.07 cm³. So 28.07 cm³, which is roughly 28.07. The option C is 28.05 cm³, so that's very close. So I think the volume needed is approximately 28.05 cm³. So that would be the first part, the volume,
