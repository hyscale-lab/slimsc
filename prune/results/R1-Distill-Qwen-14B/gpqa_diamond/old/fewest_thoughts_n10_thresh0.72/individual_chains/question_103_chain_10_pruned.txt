Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I'm a bit rusty on synthesis pathways, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me draw the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That means there's a phenyl ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3 is a bromo group, and at position 5 is a nitro group. The main chain is ethanone, so the ketone is attached to the benzene ring at position 1. Wait, noâ€”Ethan-1-one would have the ketone on a two-carbon chain, but since it's attached to the phenyl ring, I think the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3. So the ketone is at position 1, but the substituents are at 3 and 5 on the benzene.

So the benzene ring has substituents at 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ketone is at position 1. Wait, perhaps I need to visualize it more accurately. The numbering would have the ketone (C=O) group attached to the benzene at position 1. Then, at position 3 (next to it) is Br, and position 5 (across) is nitro.

So the substituents are at positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-, so when attached to the benzene, the ketone is at the position where the benzene is connected to the carbonyl. So the benzene ring has the ketone group attached at one position, and then substituents at the 3 and 5 positions relative to that.

Wait, maybe I should clarify the structure. 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would have the structure where the ethanone is
