Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics. I think I need to use special relativity here.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, I guess I need to calculate two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I think about the relative speed. Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. There's this velocity addition formula. I remember it's something like (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²), but wait, that's if the objects are moving in opposite directions. Oh wait, no. Wait, if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't simply the difference. Wait, maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait no, the relative speed formula. Let me get this straight. If one object is moving at u relative to a rest frame, and another at v in the same direction, the relative speed of the second object with respect to the first would involve using the velocity addition formula as if the first is the rest frame. So u' would be (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). No, wait, maybe I have it backwards. Wait, let me think: in the frame of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second?

Wait, the first astronaut's speed is u = 0.6c, and the second is v = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at a speed calculated using the formula. So the relative speed would be (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)) ?

Wait, because when adding velocities in relativity, if frame S' is moving at speed u relative to S, then velocities in S are transformed into S' by (v' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)) ). So in this case, in the first astronaut's frame (who is moving at 0.6c relative to the rest frame), the second astronaut's speed would be:

v_rel = (
