Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the right one.

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But this seems a bit more complicated because there are three solutions involved—HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh, right, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely.

So, first, I think I need to figure out how much acid and base are present in terms of moles. Because the neutralization reaction depends on the moles of H+ and OH- ions available.

Let me break it down. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely into H+ and Cl- ions. H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but it's diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a base; each molecule gives two OH- ions because it's Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH-.

Wait, but when you mix an acid with a base, the H+ from the acid and OH- from the base will neutralize each other. So the total moles of H+ and OH- will determine which one is the limiting reactant.

Let me calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.

First, HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol HCl. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.1 mol H+.

Next, H2SO4: volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, moles of H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So total moles of H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-, so moles of OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but when H+ and OH- react, they form
