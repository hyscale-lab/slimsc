Okay, so I've got this problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, so they’re fermions, right? That means they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold only one fermion. Oh wait, no, the spin part also matters. Each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So each unique spatial orbital can have two particles.

The system is in a 1D infinite well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the problem says E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n = n² E. So each level is E multiplied by the square of the quantum number n.

Now, for four particles, I need to fill these energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion. Since each state can hold two particles (with opposite spins), the total number of particles is four. Let's list the energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = 1² E = E
n=2: E_2 = 4E
n=3: 9E
n=4: 16E
n=5: 25E
n=6: 36E
n=7: 49E
... and so on.

But wait, each n can have two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, how do they fill up?

Ground state: the lowest energy configuration. So we'll fill the lowest available n levels, each with two particles until we reach four.

So n=1 can

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The particles are spin-1/2, which means each can have spin up or down. But wait, in a one-dimensional box, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n. Oh right, the energy for each particle is given by E_n = (n²) * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²) = n² E, since E is given as (π²ħ²)/(2mL²). So each particle's energy is n² times E.

But wait, in this case, there are four identical particles. And since they are spin-1/2, which is fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That is, each quantum state can be occupied by only one particle. But since they're identical fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange.

Hmm, so each particle has a set of quantum numbers. In a 1D box, the quantum number is just n. But because they are fermions, they must have a unique combination of (n, spin). So each particle can have the same n if their spins are different. Oh wait, no, because each n can have two possible spin states, up and down
