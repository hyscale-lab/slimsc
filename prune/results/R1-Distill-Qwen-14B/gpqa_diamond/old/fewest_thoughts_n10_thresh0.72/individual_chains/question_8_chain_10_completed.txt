Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine concerning resistance to anthracnose disease. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there are three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants for each—g1, g2, g3—and also double mutants like g1g2, etc. The idea is that at least one of these is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate other genes by binding to their promoters.

The experiment tested how resistant each mutant is to the pathogen. The control is 100% resistance. The results are:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than control)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

I think I need to figure out the gene interactions here. Let's start by looking at the single mutants. 

g2 is completely susceptible (0%), meaning that when G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That suggests that G2 is probably essential for resistance. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other defense genes. Without G2, those downstream genes aren't expressed, leading to susceptibility.

Looking at the double mutants: 

g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. Since g2 alone is 0%, maybe adding another mutation doesn't change the result, which makes sense if G2 is upstream. But wait, what about g1g3?

g1g3 has 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). But 10% is way lower, which is additive or synergistic perhaps.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, then the mutants would show certain patterns. Because if G2 is upstream, knocking out G2 would disable both pathways.

Wait, but in the single mutants: g2 is 0%, which is the most severe. So without G2, no resistance. Then what about g1 and g3? 

g1 is 75% resistance, which is lower than control but not as bad as g2. Similarly, g3 is 50% resistance. So maybe G1 and G3 are downstream of G2. Because when G2 is knocked out (g2), there's no resistance, which suggests that G2's product is necessary for the function of G1 and/or G3.

But wait, in the double mutants, when G2 is mutated, the other mutations (like g1 or g3) don't matter because the pathway is already blocked. So in the double mutants with G2, like g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is 0%, which is same as g2 alone.

Now, looking at the other double mutants: g1g3 is 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are either in separate pathways or perhaps redundant. Wait, redundancy would mean that knocking out both would have a more severe effect than either alone.

Wait, the concept of gene redundancy is when two genes do the same thing. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than either alone. For example, if both are knocked out, you lose both possible backup systems.

So in the case of g1, the resistance is 75%, which is better than g3's 50% when only G3 is knocked out. But when both are knocked out (g1g3), it's 10%, which is worse than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, perhaps, but their combined knockout is worse than either alone. Alternatively, maybe they function in the same pathway but in a way that their combined loss is more severe.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, and each contributes a part of the function. If G2 is upstream of both, then when G2 is present, G1 and G3 can contribute. But without G2, nothing works.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, then maybe G1 and G3 are target genes of G2. So G2 activates both G1 and G3. If that's the case, then knocking out G2 would mean that both G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So in that case, g2 would have 0% resistance, which matches the data.

But let's think about the single mutants. If G2 is a TF, then g2 can't activate downstream genes. So without G2, the plant has no resistance. Therefore, in the other single mutants, G1 and G3 may be downstream of G2. But if their proteins are functional, their single knockout would still have some residual function.

Wait, but in the case of G1, the single mutant is 75% resistance. So maybe G1 is part of a pathway that contributes to resistance, but not the entire pathway. Similarly, G3's single mutant is 50% resistance.

So perhaps G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3. When G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed, so the plant can't resist the pathogen. So in that case, for the single mutants, g1 and g3 are expressing G3 and G2 (for g1) and G1 and G2 (for g3), but each contributes partially to the resistance.

Wait, but in g1, with G1 knocked out, G3 is present. So if G2 is active, then G3 is expressed. So the resistance is 75%—so perhaps G3 contributes 50% of the resistance, and G1 contributes another 25%. Or something like that. Because when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75% (control is 100%); so maybe G1 contributes 25% of the resistance, and G3 contributes 50%. But when both are knocked out (g1g3), resistance is 10%, which is way worse than either single.

Hmm, but wait in the g1g3 double mutant, resistance is 10%. So that's even lower than either single mutant. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant. Because if they were redundant, then knocking out both might not make it worse than the single. Wait, no. Wait, redundancy would mean that if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. So if both are knocked out, then the phenotype would be worse than either single knockout. That's what we're seeing here.

So, for example, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then in the single mutants, each has some function. If you knock out both, then the function is completely lost, leading to a more severe phenotype.

Wait, but in this case, the double mutant's phenotype is more severe than either single, which would fit with redundancy. Because when you have both genes knocked out, their combined function is gone, so worse than each alone.

But in this case, g1 has 75% resistance, g3 has 50%, and g1g3 has 10%. So the double is much worse than either single. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant, but their contributions are additive. Because if each contributes a certain amount, their combined loss leads to a much worse phenotype.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to the same phenotype. So knocking out one削弱s the resistance, but the other can compensate a bit. But knocking out both leads to a much bigger effect.

So, if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to the same resistance mechanism, then the double mutant would have additive effects.

Wait, but in that case, the resistance would be the sum of each. So if G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%, then their double knockout would have 25 +50 =75% subtracted? No, that's not additive. Maybe more like if resistance is the sum of their contributions, then G1+G3 would be 75% (25+50?), but in the double mutant, it's 10%. That doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe it's multiplicative?

Wait, perhaps the resistance is a combination where each gene contributes to a part of the defense. So, if G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75% of control. If G3 is knocked out, it's 50%. If both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is maybe 75% - 50% = 25%? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is multiplicative. 75% (g1) * 50% (g3) = 37.5%? But the observed is 10%, which is lower. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 act in a linear pathway. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the epistasis. Epistasis refers to the interaction between genes. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene A's mutation masks the effect of gene B. So if two genes are in the same pathway, the downstream gene is epistatic.

Wait, in this case, the double mutant g2g3 has 0% resistance. So if G2 is upstream, and G3 is downstream, then the g2 knockout would mask the effect of G3. Because without G2, G3 can't be expressed. So the double mutant would have the same phenotype as g2 or g3? Well, in this data, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So that suggests that G3 is downstream of G2.

Similarly, the g1g2 double mutant is 0%, same as g2. So G1 must be downstream of G2 as well. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the double mutants where g2 is not involved. Only the g1g3 double mutant is available, with 10% resistance. So that's when both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So if G2 is upstream, and both G1 and G3 are downstream, then in wild type, G2 activates both G1 and G3. So when G1 is knocked out, only G3 is active. When G3 is knocked out, only G1 is active. When both are knocked out, neither is active. But that can't be, because the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single.

Wait, but in the g1 mutant, the resistance is 75%, so perhaps G3 contributes 25% (since without G1, the resistance is 75%, which is 25% less than 100%). Similarly, in the g3 mutant, resistance is 50%, which is 50% less. So if G1 and G3 each contribute additively, their combined loss would be 75% (g1) + 50% (g3) = 125%? That can't be. Alternatively, perhaps they contribute multiplicatively. 75% * 50% = 37.5%, but observed is 10%.

Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes a part. So without G1, the pathway is partially active (75%); without G3, it's 50% active. If they both are knocked out, the pathway is almost completely inactive (10%).

But how does that fit with G2 being upstream?

Wait, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are in the same pathway. So G1 and G3 are, for example, two components in a signaling pathway that G2 turns on. So if G2 is absent, nothing happens.

But in the case where G2 is present, knocking out either G1 or G3 reduces the pathway's activity but doesn't eliminate it. Knocking out both would eliminate it almost entirely.

So the g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, which is much lower than either single mutant. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are additive in their contribution when G2 is present.

Also, in the double mutants involving G2, like g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So the presence of G2 is necessary for any resistance in those cases.

So putting this together: G2 is the transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, each contributing to the resistance. Their individual knockouts reduce resistance, and their double knockout reduces resistance even more (synergistic effect). 

Now, looking at the options:

Option A) G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, but according to our analysis, G2 is the upstream TF, so G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's function is upstream. So this might fit. But option A says G1 is a TF, which we don't have evidence for. Since the results suggest G2 is the TF.

Option B) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter? Not sure. Also, G3 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that G3's mutation masks G1's effect. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single, which would suggest that G1 and G3's effects are additive, not one masking the other. So perhaps epistatic isn't the right term here. Also, if G1 and G3 had the same promoter, their knockouts would have the same effect, but in data, their single mutants are different (75% and 50%).

Option C) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, G1 and G3 are both involved in the same resistance pathway. So maybe pleiotropy isn't the right term. Also, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that G1's mutation masks G3's. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either single, which suggests that their effects are additive, so perhaps G3 isn't epistatic to G1.

Option D) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that their functions are overlapping, so knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype than either alone. That fits with the 10% resistance in g1g3. Also, gene redundancy implies that each can compensate for the other, so without both, the function is entirely lost.

But in the data, the single mutants have partial function. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then in the g1 mutant, G3 would compensate, leading to full resistance. But according to the data, g1 is 75% resistance. That's less than control. So that's confusing.

Wait, maybe if G1 and G3 are redundant, their single knockouts would have the same effect because the other compensates. But the data shows that g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So they don't have the same effect, which would be expected if they were redundant. So that contradicts option D.

Hmm, perhaps my reasoning is off.

Wait, maybe G2 is the TF, and both G1 and G3 are downstream. So, when G2 is active, it activates both G1 and G3. So in the single g1 mutant, G3 is still active, leading to 75% resistance. In the g3 mutant, G1 is active, leading to 50% resistance. But when both are knocked out (g1g3), neither is active, leading to 10% resistance.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute additively to the resistance. So their functions are additive, not redundant. Because when both are missing, the resistance is much worse than either single.

So gene redundancy would mean that each can fully compensate for the other. So knocking out either one would have the same effect, because the other takes over. But in the data, g1 and g3 have different resistance levels, so that suggests they are not redundant.

So perhaps the correct term is 'gene dosage' or 'additive effect', but I don't see that option. Alternatively, maybe the genes are in parallel pathways (not redundant, but additive).

But looking at the options:

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But if they were redundant, the single mutants should have the same or similar phenotype. But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which are different. So that would not fit.

So maybe option D is incorrect.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, both G1 and G3 are affecting the same trait (resistance), so I'm not sure if pleiotropy is the correct term. Alternatively, perhaps 'gene interaction' is better described as additive.

Wait, perhaps 'show pleiotropy' isn't the right term here. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Which leaves me with option A and B.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But our analysis was that G2 is the upstream TF, so G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1, which is correct. But it says G1 is a TF. We don't have evidence for that. The question states that at least one is a TF, which is G2.

So option A would be incorrect because it assigns TF status to G1, which our data suggests isn't the case.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

If G1 and G3 have the same promoter, their knockouts would affect similar or the same things. But in the data, their single mutants have different resistance levels. So same promoter seems unlikely.

Also, G3 being epistatic towards G1 would mean that G3's mutation masks G1's effect. But the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single, which suggests that their effects are additive, not one masking the other.

So option B doesn't fit.

So what about the options again? Let's reevaluate.

The correct conclusion would be that G2 is the transcription factor, upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are downstream and their functions are additive. So their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. 

Looking at the options, option D states G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but redundancy implies that each can compensate for the other. But in the data, their single knockouts are different, which would suggest they aren't redundant. So maybe 'gene redundancy' is not the right term.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'pleiotropy' isn't applicable, but something else. Hmm.

Wait, another way to look at this is through the concept of epistasis. If G2 is the transcription factor, then any mutations in G1 or G3 downstream won’t affect the phenotype if G2 is not present. So in the double mutants involving G2, the resistance is 0%, which is same as g2.

In the double mutants without G2, the phenotype is the same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the double mutant that doesn't involve G2, which is g1g3. That's the only one where the phenotype is worse than either single, which suggests that G1 and G3 contribute additively. So in the absence of G2, the double mutant's phenotype is worse than either single.

So which option reflects this?

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean that the pathway is blocked at G1, so G3's function doesn't matter. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So G3's effect isn't masked by G1's, which would be the case if G1 were epistatic. So this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic towards G1. So if G3 is knocked out, the effect of G1's knockout is masked. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about what each option says.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but G1 and G3 are both in the same trait (resistance), so that might not be the right term. Also, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as G1's mutant. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Again, redundancy doesn't fit because their single mutants have different resistances. But if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as g1. But in the data, it's worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the epistatic relationships.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene A's mutation will determine the phenotype when both A and B are mutated. If gene A is epistatic, then the double mutant (A and B) will have the same phenotype as the single mutant of A. 

In our case, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single. So this suggests that their effects are additive, not epistatic.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to the same phenotype. So their combined knockout would lead to a much worse phenotype.

But none of the options perfectly describe this, except perhaps option D, which says gene redundancy. But I think gene redundancy would mean that the single mutants have the same phenotype, but here they don't.

Wait, maybe 'show gene redundancy' isn't the exact term. Let me think again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But G1 and G3 are not showing pleiotropy but additive effects.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would have a more severe effect than either, which matches. But in the data, the single mutants have different resistance levels. So perhaps they're not redundant. Unless the redundancy is partial.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are partially redundant, then their single knockouts would have similar but not identical phenotypes, and their double would be worse.

So in this case, the single mutants have 75 and 50, which are different, but the double is 10, which is worse than either. So perhaps they are not fully redundant.

Alternatively, maybe the term 'show pleiotropy' is incorrect, and the correct term is 'show additive effects'.

But the options don't have that.

So, among the given options, which one fits best?

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. According to that, their single knockouts would have the same effect if they were fully redundant, but in the data, they don't. So this is conflicting. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think again.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the phenotype would be same as G1. But in reality, the phenotype is worse than either.

So that doesn't fit. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: the presence of G2 is required for both G1 and G3 to function. So, in the absence of G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function, leading to 0% resistance. So G2 is epistatic to both.

In the single mutants, g1 and g3, G2 is functional, allowing some expression of the other gene. So, in g1, G3 is expressed (since G2 is active), but without G1, the resistance is 75%—perhaps because G3's product contributes 75% of the resistance. Similarly, in g3, G1's product contributes 50%.

When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the only possible resistance would come from other pathways, but in the data it's 10%, which is very low. So perhaps G1 and G3 are the main contributors, and without both, the resistance is almost gone.

So, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, each contributing to resistance. Their contributions are additive.

In such a scenario, the epistatic relationship is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. But looking at the options, none of them mention this, except option A which says G2 is epistatic to G1.

So, the correct option that says G2 is the TF and that G2 is epistatic to both would probably be option A, but option A says G1 is the TF, which contradicts our analysis.

So perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype should be same as g1. But in the data, it's 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option C. Let me think again.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But as before, the double mutant doesn't match this.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. So when G2 is active, it activates both G1 and G3. The single mutants have some function, and their double mutant has minimal function.

In terms of epistatic relationships, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So any mutation in G2 masks the effect of G1 and G3.

So, looking at the options, none directly state that. The option that comes closest is option A, but that says G1 is the TF, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me re-examine the data.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So G1 and G3 must be in the same pathway, contributing additively. Also, their single mutants have different levels of resistance, which suggests they contribute different amounts.

So, if G2 is the TF, then G1 and G3 are downstream. Their effects are additive. So the only option that reflects G2 being the TF and the interaction between G1 and G3 is option D, but I'm not sure about the 'gene redundancy' part.

Alternatively, another possibility: G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes to the same function. So their combined loss has a more severe effect than either alone. This would be called 'synergistic' interaction, not redundancy.

But the options don't use that term. So perhaps the correct option is D, even if 'gene redundancy' isn't the perfect term.

Wait, another approach: which options correctly identify G2 as the TF and have the correct epistatic relationships?

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. Incorrect, because G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, correct so far. Then G1 and G3 same promoter; if they have same promoter, then their knockouts would have the same effect. But data shows different effects. So B is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, correct. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure. G1 is epistatic towards G3. So if G1 is epistatic, double mutant would be same as G1. But data says worse, so C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, correct. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Not sure, but their single knockouts have different effects. So maybe D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and their combined loss leads to a worse phenotype. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'll have to make a choice.

Wait, thinking about the data again: 

In the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10% which is worse than either single, so their effects are additive. So the correct conclusion would be that G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance, and G2 is the upstream TF. 

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This doesn't fit because:

- The single mutants have different resistances, so not redundant.

- Epistatic relationship doesn't fit because the double is worse than either.

So perhaps the correct option is option D is incorrect, and none of the options fit perfectly, but the best one is option D. Wait, no, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let me think.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is not the right term. But perhaps the question is using 'pleiotropy' to mean that they have multiple functions, but in this case, they only function in the same pathway, so perhaps not. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. But as their single mutants have different resistances, this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because gene redundancy doesn't require the single mutants to have the same phenotype. For instance, if G1 and G3 are partially redundant, their single knockouts might have similar but not identical resistances, but their double would be much worse.

Wait, but in this case, g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%, which are different. So unless they have different levels of redundancy, which is possible.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think I need to make a decision based on the options.

The correct answer must involve G2 as the TF, which is upstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to worse resistance than either alone, which suggests additive effects.

Looking again, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. While this term usually implies that the single knockouts are the same, perhaps the question uses it more loosely. Alternatively, perhaps 'additive' is not an option, so the closest option is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the effect is worse than either, which aligns with redundancy leading to a more severe phenotype when both are missing.

So, given that, the answer would be option D. Alternatively, I'm not sure, but I think that's the best fit.


The question involves analyzing the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine to determine their roles in resistance to anthracnose. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer the gene interactions and their functional relationships.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (less than wild-type but not completely susceptible).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (partially susceptible).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).

3. **Inference**:
   - **G2 is a transcription factor (TF)**: The complete susceptibility of g2 (0% resistance) suggests that G2 is essential for resistance and likely acts upstream of other genes.
   - **G1 and G3 are downstream of G2**: The resistance levels of g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) indicate that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2.
   - **G1 and G3 contribute additively**: The resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, suggesting that G1 and G3 function in the same pathway and their contributions are additive rather than redundant or epistatic.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1. This is incorrect because the data suggests G2, not G1, is the upstream TF. Additionally, pleiotropy is not supported as G1 and G3 are in the same pathway.

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 share the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. This is incorrect because the single mutants (g1 and g3) have different resistance levels, which contradicts the idea of sharing the same promoter. Furthermore, the double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, which does not fit an epistatic relationship.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This is incorrect because pleiotropy is not applicable here, as G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. Additionally, the double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, which contradicts the idea of G1 being epistatic towards G3.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While gene redundancy typically implies that single mutants would have the same phenotype, the data shows different resistance levels for g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). However, the double mutant g1g3 (10%) being worse than either single mutant aligns with the idea of partial redundancy or additive effects. Despite some ambiguity in the term "gene redundancy," this option is the closest fit to the data.

### Conclusion:
The data supports the conclusion that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance. While the term "gene redundancy" in Option D is not a perfect fit, it is the best match among the given options.
