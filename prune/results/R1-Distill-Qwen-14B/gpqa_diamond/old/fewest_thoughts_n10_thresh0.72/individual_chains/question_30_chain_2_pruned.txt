Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, let me think. The question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color of light is absorbed.

Wait, I remember that when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. And the color it emits is related to the energy gap it has. Oh right, this has to do with the energy levels in the molecule. The conjugated pi-electrons probably form a system that allows for certain energy transitions.

So, the energy of the emitted light relates to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. I think the energy (E) and the wavelength (λ) are connected by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. But wait, I also remember that energy and wavelength are inversely proportional—so higher energy means shorter wavelength.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, not emitted. Oh, right! The compound absorbs light of a certain energy, which causes the electrons to get excited. Then, when they drop back to the ground state, they emit light. So the emitted light's energy is actually the same as the absorbed energy. Or wait, no, maybe the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed one because some energy is lost as heat or something. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me get this straight. When a molecule absorbs light (say, with energy E_abs), an electron gets excited from
