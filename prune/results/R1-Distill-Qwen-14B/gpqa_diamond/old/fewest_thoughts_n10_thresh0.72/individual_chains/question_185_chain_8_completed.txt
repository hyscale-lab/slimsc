Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics represents the energy of a system, and its eigenvalues correspond to possible energy measurements.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So σ · n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the vector n. That makes sense because the dot product of vectors is similar to the sum of products of their components.

Pauli matrices... right, each Pauli matrix σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are 2x2 matrices. The dot product σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. 

Now, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix. Wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, when you have a sum of Pauli matrices multiplied by coefficients, what's the eigenvalue? Oh wait, no, the eigenvalues of σ · n would be the eigenvalues of each component multiplied by the coefficients and then summed. But wait, no—actually, because the Pauli matrices don't commute, the eigenvalues don't just add up directly. Oh wait, but for any direction n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 multiplied by some factor?

Wait, wait, another approach. The operator σ · n is a Pauli vector in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix in any direction should be ±1 times the magnitude of the operator. But wait, in this case, the operator is ε times σ · n. Wait, no. σ · n is a matrix, and when you multiply by ε, the eigenvalues are scaled by ε.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues of ±1. But when you have σ · n, which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, what are its eigenvalues? Let's consider that any spin component in a particular direction has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 when multiplied by the Pauli matrices. Wait, wait, because in the standard spin-½ system, the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ · n. So the eigenvalues of S are ±ħ/2 times n. So the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2 in that case.

Wait, but in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. So in that case, H is proportional to σ · n. So what are the eigenvalues of H? Well, σ · n is a 2x2 matrix. Let's compute its eigenvalues.

The Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1. Wait, σ_x has determinant -1? Let me double-check. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) ) = -1. Similarly for σ_y and σ_z. So for the matrix A = σ · n, which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, what's its trace and determinant?

Wait, the trace of A is the sum of the diagonal elements. The Pauli matrices are each trace zero. So, n_x σ_x has trace zero, same for others. So A is traceless. The determinant of A would be det(A) = (A_{11} A_{22} - A_{12} A_{21}) ), but since it's a 2x2 matrix, the determinant can be found using the formula for 2x2 matrices. Alternatively, I recall that for a matrix of the form a σ · n, the determinant is -(a^2), because the eigenvalues are ±a. Wait, wait, that's right. Because if a matrix has eigenvalues λ and -λ, then the trace is zero, and the determinant is λ*(-λ) = -λ². So if the matrix has eigenvalues ±a, then determinant is -a².

In our case, A = σ · n. Let's compute its square. (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Since σ_i and σ_j anticommute when i≠j and σ_i² = I (identity matrix), so when you square the sum, you get n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + cross terms. The cross terms are n_x n_y {σ_x σ_y} + ... but {σ_i σ_j} = 2 δ_{ij} I. Wait, no, actually, σ_i σ_j = i ε_{ijk} σ_k + δ_{ij} I. So when i≠j, σ_i σ_j = i ε_{ijk} σ_k. But when you square (σ · n), the cross terms will involve σ_i σ_j, but when you sum over i and j, the cross terms should cancel out because n is a unit vector. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The sum (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, each σ_i squared is I, and cross terms involve σ_i σ_j which are off-diagonal terms. But the sum should be equal to (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. So (σ · n)^2 = I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. But wait, wait, the sum of σ_i σ_j over i≠j is perhaps zero? Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that (σ · a)(σ · b) = σ · a σ · b = a·b I + i (a × b) · σ. So in our case, (σ · n)^2 = (n · n) I + i (n × n) · σ. But n × n is zero, so (σ ·n )² = (1) I + 0 = I. So (σ ·n )² = I. 

So the eigenvalues of (σ ·n ) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of I. Wait, I is the identity matrix with eigenvalues 1. So (σ ·n )² has eigenvalues 1, so σ ·n has eigenvalues ±1. Because the square is 1, so the original must be ±1.

Wait, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues of σ ·n are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H= ε σ ·n are ε times those, so +ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε. So the correct answer should be option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is an energy constant. To find the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

The Pauli matrices \( \vec{\sigma} \) are 2x2 Hermitian matrices, and their eigenvalues are \( \pm 1 \). For a general direction \( \vec{n} \), the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices in the direction of \( \vec{n} \). The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are also \( \pm 1 \), as this operator is a scaled version of the Pauli matrices.

When multiplied by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \varepsilon \cdot (+1) = +\varepsilon \) and \( \varepsilon \cdot (-1) = -\varepsilon \). Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \( H \) are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

From the given options:
- Option A: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).
- Option B: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as derived above.
- Option C: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are not scaled by \( \hbar/2 \).
- Option D: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not involve \( \varepsilon \).

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
