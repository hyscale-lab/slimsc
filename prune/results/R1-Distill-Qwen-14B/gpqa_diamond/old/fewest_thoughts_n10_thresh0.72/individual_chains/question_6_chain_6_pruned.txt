Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says. 

The problem is about a particle of mass m moving in two dimensions with a potential given by V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. And I need to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Hmm, alright. So, first, I should probably recall what kind of potentials lead to known energy spectra. The given potential looks like a combination of a harmonic oscillator and something else. Let me break it down.

The potential has two terms: (1/2)k r², which I recognize as the standard harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. But wait, no, actually, in two dimensions, the harmonic oscillator potential is V(r) = (1/2)k r², right? Because in 2D, r is the radial coordinate, so it's the same as in 3D but with one less dimension. 

Wait, but the second term here is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. That term depends on the angle θ. So the potential isn't spherically symmetric anymore. Because cos²θ varies with θ, the potential depends on direction. That suggests that the system isn't rotationally symmetric, meaning the angular part of the wavefunction will play a role beyond just being a simple harmonic oscillator.

So, how do I approach this? Maybe I can separate the potential into radial and angular parts to see if it can be expressed in a form that resembles known potentials. Let's see, let's factor out r² from both terms:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ]

Hmm, but that doesn't help much. Alternatively, I can express cos²θ in terms of cos(2θ) using a trigonometric identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let's try that:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2
= (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² (
