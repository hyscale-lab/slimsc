Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a charge q placed a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics. I remember that when charges are in place, the potential energy is the work done to bring them to their positions. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that probably affects the induced charges.

So the setup is a conducting sphere, which when grounded, means it's connected to the earth, so any induced charges can flow in or out. When a charge q is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges. But since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero because the ground is at zero potential. 

Right, so for a conducting sphere, the potential is the same over the entire surface. Since it's grounded, that potential is zero. So the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere must cancel out the potential at the sphere's surface caused by the charge q.

Let me think about how the charges distribute. The charge q will induce equal and opposite charges on the sphere. Because the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges will reside on its surface. But because the sphere is grounded, the total induced charge can change. Wait, no, actually, if the sphere is initially neutral, then the presence of q will cause the sphere to have induced charges. But since it's grounded, the net charge on the sphere can adjust. So if q is positive, the sphere will have negative induced charges, but since it's grounded, any excess would flow away. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. When a grounded conducting sphere is placed near a charge, it's like the sphere has induced charges. The charge q will induce a charge -q' on the sphere's surface, but since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge will leave, so the sphere's net charge is zero. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if you place a charge near a conductor, the conductor's surface charges adjust, but being grounded, the conductor's potential is zero. So the conductor's potential is the sum of potentials due to the charge q and the induced charges on itself.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using the method of images. Oh right, for a conducting sphere, the image charge method can be used. The charge q outside the sphere will have an
