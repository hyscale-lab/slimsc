Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best to work through it.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms compounds with F. There are five such compounds known. The problem gives some reactions and properties of these compounds, and we need to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me list out the given information:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. The oF of A2 is 31.96%. I'm not exactly sure what "ɷF" stands for here, but maybe it's the oxidation state of fluorine or perhaps the percentage composition. Wait, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass? Let me think. If A2 has 31.96% fluorine by mass, that could help determine its formula.

2. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. That suggests A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine compounds, especially those with high oxidation states, are often oxidizing agents. For example, F2 itself is a strong oxidizer, but A1 might be something like YF5 or another compound where Y is in a high oxidation state.

3. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is a binary compound of Y and F. Like YF, YF2, YF3, etc. If A3 reacts with xenon, perhaps it's a less oxidizing compound than A1 but still reactive enough.

4. Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. So A4 is a compound of Y and F, and when Y is added, another compound (A5) forms. This might involve a redox reaction or a substitution.

5. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So when A5 is placed in H2O, it breaks down into two products. Maybe it's releasing some ions or gases, like HF or O2, but I'm not certain.

Our goal is to find the molecular weight of A4.

Let me try to identify what Y might be. Since Y forms five binary compounds with fluorine, Y must be an element that can have multiple oxidation states with F. Common elements that form several fluorides include nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, etc. Let's think about nitrogen. Nitrogen can form NF3, N2F4, and others, but I'm not sure if there are five. Alternatively, phosphorus can form P F3, P F5, and others. Wait, phosphorus has PF3, PF5, maybe P2F7, and other polyatomic forms? But does phosphorus form five binary fluorides? Let me think. PF3, PF5, P2F4 (maybe), P2F6, and perhaps others. Maybe five. Alternatively, another element like iodine? No, because iodine's compounds are more about IFn, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine? No, because chlorine's binary fluorides are less common. Hmm.

Wait, considering that A1 is a bright red substance. Fluorine-based compounds that are bright red... F2 itself is pale yellow, but maybe the compound is something like YF4? Wait, which compounds are bright red? For example, lead dioxide (PbO2) is dark brown, not red. Alternatively, maybe Y is sulfur? But sulfur's fluorides are not common. Alternatively, perhaps Y is vanadium? No, I don't think so. Wait, another approach: what about the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. So A1 → A2 + F2. Let's assume that A2 contains Y and F. So perhaps A1 is YF5, which upon decomposition gives YF3 and F2? No, wait, let's think about the oxidation states.

If A1 is YF5, which would mean Y is in +5 oxidation state. When it decomposes, maybe Y loses some fluorine atoms. For example, YF5 → YF3 + F2. Then, YF3 would have Y in +3 oxidation state. But I'm not certain if this is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF3, but that doesn't seem to fit because YF3 is not typically red. Wait, another approach: the oF (fluorine percentage) of A2 is 31.96%. Let me calculate what that implies.

Assuming A2 is YF_x. The mass percent of F is (19*x)/(atomic mass of Y +
