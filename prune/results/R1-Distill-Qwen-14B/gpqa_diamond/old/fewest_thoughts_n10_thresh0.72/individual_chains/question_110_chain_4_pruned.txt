Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by understanding the basics.

First, the question gives me some information about the two spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. The user says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed," and for HIRES, brighter than 16 mag. Wait, so they can observe up to 17 mag for ESPRESSO and up to 16 mag for HIRES. Because lower magnitude means brighter, right? So a star with V=17 is fainter than V=16. So ESPRESSO can detect fainter stars than HIRES since 17 is fainter than 16 (since higher magnitude means dimmer). Wait, no, no. Wait, magnitude scale is inverse. Oh wait, no, that's correct. So, for example, the faintest star ESPRESSO can detect is 17 mag, and the faintest HIRES can see is 16 mag. So any star with apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 can be seen by HIRES.

Wait, wait, no. The way the question is phrased:
