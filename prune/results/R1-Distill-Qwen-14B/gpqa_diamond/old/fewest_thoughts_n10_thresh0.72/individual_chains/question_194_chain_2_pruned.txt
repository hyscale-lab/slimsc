Okay, so I've got this physics problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let me try to think through this.

The problem says we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We're supposed to find the partition function Z. The options are A through D, each with different expressions involving exponentials and coefficients.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Oh wait, no, actually, in the canonical ensemble, it's summing over all states exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to consider all possible spin configurations and their energies, then compute the sum.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. That's manageable. So maybe I can list all possible states and calculate their energies.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. Let's think about the energy expression. E is -J times the sum of the products of each pair. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute each term.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's denote H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H. So the energy depends on H. So for each state, H can have certain values, and then E is determined by that.

So H can take various values. Let's figure out what possible values H can take. Each term in H is the product of two spins. Since each spin is ±1, the product is also ±1. So each term in H is ±1. So H is the sum of three terms each ±1.

So the possible sums can range from -3 to +3, in steps of 2? Wait, no. Let's see: the maximum when all three terms are +1, so H=3. The minimum when
