Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet would mean each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each has three neighbors.

Wait, the triplet is at 0.9 ppmâ€”that's usually indicative of methyl groups attached to something, maybe branching. Like in a diethyl group. Because in diethyl groups, the CH2 groups are next to two other CH2 groups, leading to splitting. Let me think: for diethyl groups, the CH2CH2 structure. So maybe the triplet is the terminal methyl groups of an ethyl chain. Each CH3 would be next to a CH2, so they'd split into a quartet? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the triplet is for the 6H. So 6H divided into two triplets? Or maybe it's from two methyl groups.

Wait, if the 6H is a triplet, that's like two equivalent methyl groups. Each methyl has two neighboring protons. Maybe each CH3 is next to a CH2. So perhaps the structure is (CH2CH3)2 group, like diethyl something. Because each CH3 would be adjacent to a CH2, which has two protons, so the CH3 would be a triplet. Wait, no, the CH3 would be a triplet if each of the two neighboring protons is on adjacent carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the triplet is from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. Each triplet proton has two neighbors. So each proton in that group is next to two others. Wait, but 6H is a lot. Maybe it's two equivalent methyl groups each with 3H, making a triplet. Because each CH3 is attached to a CH2 which has two protons. So each CH3 would split into a triplet. So that would make sense. So
