Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. Hmm, let me start by understanding the given Lagrangian and the particles involved.

The Lagrangian is given as a subset, but the relevant parts include terms for the singlet fermions N_R, the scalar doublet S, and the singlet scalar φ. The terms are like kinetic terms for N_R, some derivatives of the scalar fields, and interaction terms with Yukawa couplings and gauge fields. Also, there's a potential V(φ, S, H), but I think H is another scalar, maybe a doublet, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the Lagrangian terms. Oh wait, the fields are N_iR (singlet fermions), S (a scalar doublet), and φ (a singlet scalar). The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given as ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², where ⟨φ⟩ is x and ⟨h⟩ is v. Wait, wait—h is another field, perhaps the Higgs? Or maybe φ is the Higgs field?

Wait, according to the question, the particles are: N_iR are singlets with quantum numbers (1,1,0) under (charge, SU(2), Y), right? S is a scalar doublet (1,2,1), which would be like the usual Higgs doublet. The singlet scalar φ is (1,1,0). So the VEVs are ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. Hmm, perhaps φ is part of a doublet, but wait, in the Lagrangian, φ is a singlet. Or maybe the Higgs is a combination of S and φ? Or perhaps H is another scalar field not mentioned here.

Wait, the potential V(φ, S, H) suggests that H is another field. But I don't see H in the other terms. Maybe H is part of the scalar sector, perhaps another doublet or singlet. But perhaps the model has more scalars beyond what I initially thought. Alternatively, maybe S is the Higgs, and φ is another sing
