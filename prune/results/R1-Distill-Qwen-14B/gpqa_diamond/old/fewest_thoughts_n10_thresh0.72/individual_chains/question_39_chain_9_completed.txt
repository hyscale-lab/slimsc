Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a particle whose wave function is given, and we need to find the normalization constant 'a'. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, hold on, that doesn't look right. Oh, wait, no, the wave function is probably written as a function of x. Wait, but in the question, it's written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wave functions usually are complex, so the presence of 'i' makes sense. But wait, in the given wave function, is it (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i? That would be a complex function where the real part is a / sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Or wait, maybe I'm misreading it. Let me check again. Oh wait, perhaps the entire term is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) multiplied by something else, like maybe (1 - 0.5i)? Like, perhaps the expression is a*(1/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i? Or maybe it's a/(sqrt(1+x)) plus some imaginary term. Wait, the way it's written in the problem is: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. Oh wait, maybe it's a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) multiplied by something else, like (1 - 0.5i), but the way it's written in the question is just (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm. Maybe I should try to parse the equation correctly.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by a complex term, maybe (1 - 0.5i)? Because that would make more sense. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) * (1 - 0.5i), which combines both terms. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is a real function minus an imaginary constant. But that seems a bit odd because the real and imaginary parts usually vary with x, not being constants. Wait, no, in this case, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's an interesting setup. So the real part depends on x, while the imaginary part is a constant. Hmm.

Wait, but regardless of how it's structured, the key point is that the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Since the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3, the wave function is zero elsewhere. So we can set up the normalization condition as the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square would be ψ*(x) * ψ(x), where ψ* is the complex conjugate. So let's compute that.

The wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. The complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1 +x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying them together, we get:

ψ*(x) * ψ(x) = [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ]

This is of the form (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B², where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = 0.5i. Wait, but B is imaginary. Let's compute it:

= (a/sqrt(1+x))² - (0.5i)^2

But (0.5i)^2 = (0.5)^2 * (i)^2 = 0.25 * (-1) = -0.25. So the expression becomes:

= (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25

So the absolute square is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, another way: the product is [A + B][A - B] = A² - B². Since B is 0.5i, B squared is (0.5i)^2 = -0.25. So the product is A² - (-0.25) = A² + 0.25. Oh yes, right.

So the integrand becomes (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that can't be right because the absolute square is a real, positive function. But I think I made a mistake because when I multiply, perhaps I should do it more carefully.

Let me compute [a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i] * [a/sqrt(1+x) -0.5i].

Multiplying term by term:

First term: a/sqrt(1+x) * a/sqrt(1+x) = a²/(1+x).

Second term: a/sqrt(1+x) * (-0.5i) = -0.5i a / sqrt(1+x).

Third term: 0.5i * a/sqrt(1+x) = 0.5i a / sqrt(1+x).

Fourth term: 0.5i * (-0.5i) = -0.25i² = -0.25*(-1) = 0.25.

Now, when we add all these terms together:

The second and third terms cancel each other out because they are negatives. So we're left with a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integrand is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait. When you have a complex number, the absolute square is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts, right? So for ψ(x) = A + Bi, |ψ|^2 = A² + B². So in this case, A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = -0.5. So |ψ|^2 is (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (-0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Yes, that's correct.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [(a²)/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

So let's write that integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this into two separate integrals:

a² * ∫(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 * ∫ dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C.

Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is simply (3 -1) = 2.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 divided by ln(2). Let me calculate that.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Therefore, a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.7213). 0.85^2 is 0.7225, which is very close. So a is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) equals 1. 

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1.
\]

The first integral evaluates as:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

The second integral evaluates as:

\[
\int_1^3 dx = 3 - 1 = 2.
\]

Substituting these results back, we get:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1.
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Subtract \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
