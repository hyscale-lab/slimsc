Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, okay, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the seven crystal systems. Right, rhombohedral is like a special kind of hexagonal or something? No, wait, rhombohedral has all sides equal and all angles equal too. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, but wait, rhombohedral can have different angles. But in this case, all are 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along a lattice parameter, right? So the lattice constant a is 10 Angstrom here. Because in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell has three vectors a, b, c, but all are equal in length. So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms each.

We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. Oh right, the formula is 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 +
