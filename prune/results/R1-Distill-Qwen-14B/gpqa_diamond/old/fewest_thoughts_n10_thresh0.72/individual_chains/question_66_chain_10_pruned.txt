Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? It's a framework where you write down all possible interactions that can occur at low energies, respecting the Standard Model's gauge symmetry but allowing for higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, and each dimension adds more possible terms.

The question is asking which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Oh right, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Because in field theories, you often have both. But SMEFT is a field theory, so it has to respect the Poincare symmetry. But wait, the question is asking which must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare includes Lorentz, then any operator respecting Poincare would automatically respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require both?

Wait, SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory derived from it. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes translations. SMEFT is a quantum field theory, so it must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, hence Poincare. So 2 should also be correct.
