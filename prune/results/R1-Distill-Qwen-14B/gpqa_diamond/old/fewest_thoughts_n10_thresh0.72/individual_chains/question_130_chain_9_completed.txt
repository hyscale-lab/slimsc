Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshift. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, Lyman alpha emission is usually in the ultraviolet range, right? So when that light is absorbed by hydrogen clouds, it's in the Lyman series. But when the quasar's light is redshifted, the absorption line we see would be at a longer wavelength.

Redshift (z) is calculated using the formula: observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * (1 + z). So if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+z).

But wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't detect wavelengths beyond about 1 micrometer, right? Because Earth's atmosphere is opaque to longer wavelengths (like infrared) for ground-based observations. So the maximum wavelength we can observe from the ground is around 1000 Angstroms (since 1 micrometer is 10,000 Angstroms? Wait, no, wait. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers. 1000 Angstroms is 100 nm, which is ultraviolet. Oh wait, no, optical is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms.

Wait, maybe I confused the units. Let me think again. 1 micrometer is 10,000 Angstroms. So optical wavelengths are from about 4000 Angstroms (400 nm, violet) to 7000 Angstroms (700 nm, red). So ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths much beyond 7000 Angstroms, but can they observe anything in the infrared? I think not without atmospheric windows. So the maximum wavelength that can be observed is around 7000 Angstroms. 

Wait, but sometimes ground telescopes can observe some near-infrared through certain atmospheric windows, like the J band at about 1.2 micrometers (12,000 Angstroms). But I'm not sure if that's common enough for this purpose. Maybe the question assumes that the observed wavelength must be in the optical range, say less than approximately 7000 Angstroms.

So the Lyman-alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms. When the quasar's light is redshifted, the absorption line we observe on the ground is at 1216*(1+z). But for us to see this in optical wavelengths, the observed wavelength must be less than or equal to about 7000 Angstroms. Because if it's longer, it's in the infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't see well (without being in space, like Hubble).

Wait, but if the observed wavelength is longer than 7000 Angstroms, then it's in the infrared, which can't be detected from the ground. So we need the observed wavelength to be less than 7000 Angstroms.

So setting up the equation: 1216*(1 + z) ≤ 7000.

Solving for z: 

1 + z ≤ 7000 / 1216
Let's compute that.

7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.758

So 1 + z ≤ 5.758 → z ≤ 4.758.

Wait, but that gives the upper limit on z. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that the absorption can be detected. Hmm, maybe I'm getting it backwards.

Wait, the clouds are at some redshift z. The quasar is behind them, so the quasar's light has a higher redshift than the clouds. Wait, no, maybe the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the light from the quasar passes through the cloud, which is at a lower redshift. So the quasar's light is redshifted more than the cloud's absorption line.

Wait, no, the quasar's emission is further away, so it's redshifted more. So the cloud's hydrogen is at a redshift z_cloud, and the quasar is at a higher redshift, z_quasar. The absorption line we see is the Lyman alpha at (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 Angstroms. Because the quasar's light is redshifted by z_quasar, but the absorption line from the cloud is only at z_cloud.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The quasar emits light that passes through the hydrogen cloud. The cloud is at a redshift z_cloud, so the Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. The quasar itself is at a higher redshift, so its emitted light is redshifted more. But the absorption line we observe is from the cloud, so the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = lambda_obs.

As the quasar's light is further redshifted, but the absorption line's redshift is only due to the cloud. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, lambda_obs must be ≤ 7000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤ 7000.

So 1 + z_cloud ≤ 7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.758 → z_cloud ≤ ~4.758.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the object (the cloud) such that the absorption can be detected. So if the cloud is at a lower redshift, then the observed wavelength is shorter. If the cloud is at a higher redshift, observed wavelength is longer.

Wait, but if the cloud is at a lower redshift, then z_cloud is small, so 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is less than 1216*2 = 2432 Angstroms. Which is in the UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see. So for the cloud's absorption line to be in the optical range (so we can detect it), the observed wavelength must be ≤7000 Angstroms.

So the maximum possible z_cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 7000 → z_cloud = (7000/1216) -1 ≈5.758-1=4.758.

Wait, but the question is the lower limit on the redshift of the object (the cloud) such that they can be detected. Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense. Because if the cloud is at a lower redshift, then the observed wavelength is shorter (bluer), which is in the UV, which ground telescopes can't see. So for the cloud's absorption line to be in the optical (so we can detect it), the cloud must have a redshift such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤7000. So the maximum z_cloud is 4.758. But if z_cloud is lower than that, then the observed wavelength is shorter than 7000, but perhaps in the UV. So the lower limit on the redshift z_cloud would be the point where 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is just about 4000 Angstroms (the start of the optical range). Because if the observed wavelength is longer than that, it's in the visible.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

We need the observed wavelength (from the cloud) to be in the optical range, so that ground-based telescopes can see it. The optical range is roughly 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So 4000 ≤ 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤7000.

So solving for z_cloud:

Lower limit: 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≥4000 → (1 + z_cloud) ≥4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z_cloud ≥2.29.

Upper limit: as before, z_cloud ≈4.758.

So the cloud must have a redshift between 2.29 and 4.758.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29. But looking at the options, I see options C is 2.4, D is 1.9. Hmm, so 2.29 is close to 2.3.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

4000 / 1216 ≈3.29.

Wait, 1216 *3 =3648. 1216 *3.2 is 1216*3 +1216*.2=3648 +243.2=3891.2. 1216 *3.29 = ?

Calculating 1216 *3.29:

3 *1216=3648.

0.29 *1216: 0.2*1216=243.2; 0.09 *1216=109.44. So total 243.2 +109.44=352.64.

So 3648 +352.64 =3999.64 ≈4000.

So 1 + z_cloud =3.29 → z_cloud=2.29.

So the lower limit is 2.29, which is approximately 2.3. Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is close, but higher than this. So why isn't 2.3 an option?

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe the quasar's light is what's being observed, and the absorption line is from the cloud. So the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). For the cloud's absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be ≤7000.

So the maximum z_cloud is (7000/1216) -1 ≈4.758. So the cloud must have z_cloud ≤4.758 to have its Lyman alpha line in the optical. But if z_cloud is lower than that, then the observed wavelength would be bluer, possibly in UV, which ground telescopes can't see. Wait, but for the cloud's absorption to be in optical, you need the observed wavelength to be between 4000 and 7000.

So the lower limit on z_cloud is when 1216*(1 +z_cloud) =4000 → z_cloud= (4000/1216) -1.

Wait, 4000/1216 is approximately 3.29. So 3.29-1=2.29.

So the cloud must have a redshift z_cloud ≥2.29 for the observed Lyman alpha line to be in the optical. Wait, no. Wait, lower z_cloud would make the observed wavelength shorter. So if z_cloud is 2.29, the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms (violet). If z_cloud is higher, the wavelength is longer, into the optical. So the minimum redshift for the cloud's absorption line to be in the optical is when z_cloud is 2.29, making the observed wavelength 4000 Angstroms (the start of optical). So any cloud with z_cloud ≥2.29 would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical, which is detectable from the ground.

So the lower limit on the redshift is about 2.29, so the object (cloud) must have a redshift at least 2.29. Among the options, option C is 2.4, which is the closest. But option D is 1.9, which would give 1216*(2.9)=3526.4, which is 3526 Angstroms, which is UV (since optical starts at around 4000). So option D's z of 1.9 would give an observed wavelength too short (3526), which is UV, not visible. So the lower limit is around 2.3, so the correct answer would be option C, 2.4.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe the question is about the quasar's redshift, not the cloud's. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar. So the quasar has a higher redshift than the cloud. So if the cloud is at z_cloud, the quasar is at z_quasar > z_cloud.

But the absorption line we see is from the cloud, so the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for the absorption to be in optical, as before, the cloud's z must be at least 2.29.

So the lower limit is 2.29, which is approximately 2.3, so the closest option is C) 2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the quasar's redshift. Because the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud for the cloud to absorb its light. But the question is about the redshift of the cloud (the object in question is the cloud).

Therefore, the correct answer is option C) 2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption lines can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Key Concepts**:  
   - The Lyman-alpha absorption line is emitted at a rest wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \).  
   - When redshifted, the observed wavelength is given by \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z) \), where \( z \) is the redshift.  
   - Optical ground-based telescopes can only detect wavelengths in the range \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å} \).

2. **Condition for Detection**:  
   For the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:  
   \[
   4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + z) \), we get:  
   \[
   4000 \leq 1216 \cdot (1 + z) \leq 7000.
   \]

3. **Solving for \( z \)**:  
   - For the **lower limit** (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \)):  
     \[
     1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29 \implies z \geq 2.29.
     \]  
   - For the **upper limit** (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 7000 \, \text{Å} \)):  
     \[
     1 + z \leq \frac{7000}{1216} \approx 5.76 \implies z \leq 4.76.
     \]

4. **Interpretation**:  
   The redshift \( z \) of the neutral hydrogen cloud must satisfy \( 2.29 \leq z \leq 4.76 \) for its Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable in the optical range. The question asks for the **lower limit** on the redshift, which is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( z = 2.4 \).

5. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (3)**: Too high; the lower limit is closer to 2.3.  
   - **Option B (1.2)**: Too low; at this redshift, the observed wavelength would be in the ultraviolet, which ground-based telescopes cannot detect.  
   - **Option C (2.4)**: Closest to the calculated lower limit of 2.29.  
   - **Option D (1.9)**: Too low; at this redshift, the observed wavelength would be \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the ultraviolet.

Thus, the correct answer is **C) 2.4**.
