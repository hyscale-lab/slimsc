Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1. The question is asking about the coupled angular momentum state when considering both electrons together.

The state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, you combine their individual quantum numbers. So l₁ and l₂ are 1 each. When you add them, the possible total l values go from |l₁ - l₂| to l₁ + l₂. So with both l's being 1, the possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. In this case, the total l is 2, which is the maximum possible (since 1+1=2). And the m value here is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for each electron. We need the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ. So each electron's Lz is measured to be -ħ.

Wait, but wait. The orbital angular momentum for an electron is given by L = ħ√(l(l+1)) multiplied by some direction component. The eigenvalues of Lz are mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number for the orbital. So for each electron, if the state is in a p orbital, then l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, ħ.

But the state here is a coupled state, which takes into account the total angular momentum. So the individual states are not in their own m states but are entangled in a way that their combined m gives the total m.

Hmm, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l=1, and the total l is 2. The m for the total state is -1. So the sum of m₁ and m₂ must be -1. Because m_total = m₁ + m₂.

So for each electron, m₁ can be -1, 0,
