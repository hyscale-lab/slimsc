Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. And the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium... I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed decreases. The formula I think is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, here the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed as perceived in the lab?

Oh right, this is a scenario where both the medium (glass) and the light are moving relative to the lab. So I think I need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity. Because if the glass is moving, the light's speed wouldn't just be v = c/n, right?

Wait, wait. Let me think. In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But from the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, what would the observed speed be?

So I remember the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, in this case, u is the speed of light in the glass as observed in the glass's frame. So u would be c/n. So substituting, the observed speed u' would be ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ).

Let me compute that denominator: 1 + (v c)/(n c² ) = 1 + v/(n c). So the denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c).

Wait, but c is 1 in the problem statement, so that simplifies things. So denominator is 1 + v/(n).

So the numerator is (1/n) + v. Because c is 1, so c/n is 1/n.

So u' = ( (1/n) +
