Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let's start by understanding what's being asked here.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_bar f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh right, in particle physics, the Lagrangian describes the interaction between fields. So here, the boson X is interacting with some fermion fields, right? The fermions are represented by ψ_f(y), and λ is the coupling constant.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to determine which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into. 

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy is sufficient for the decay products. For a decay to happen, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because each fermion in the pair would have mass m, so 2m must be less than or equal to the mass of X, which is 6 GeV.

So first, I'll list all possible fermions that could be produced in pairs and check their masses. Let's think about the known elementary particles. The fermions include quarks of various flavors, like up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top, and the leptons: electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. But wait, neutrinos are very light, but in this case, the problem probably isn't considering them because their masses are negligible, and X's mass is 6 GeV.

So the possible fermions are the quarks and charged leptons. Let's list their masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV/c²
- Down quark (d): around 4-5 MeV/c²
- Strange quark (s): about 100 MeV/c²
- Charm quark (c): around 1.5 GeV/c²
- Bottom quark (b): approximately 4.5 GeV/c²
- Top quark (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV/c²
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible, so I can ignore them.

So, X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's see for each possible fermion pair, whether 2m_f is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

For the quarks:

- u: 2m = 4 MeV → yes
- d: 8 MeV → yes
- s: 200 MeV → yes
- c: 3 GeV → yes, since 3 <6
- b: 9 GeV → wait, 2m_b is 9 GeV? Because
