Okay, so I have this question about which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light. Chiral centers are carbons bonded to four different groups. But wait, there's more. There's also something about meso compounds and other forms of stereoisomerism like geometric isomerism, which is different from optical activity.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl structures can have different conformations, right? The substituents are on each ring. Wait, but can they have chiral centers? Let me visualize. The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, maybe there's a possibility of a chiral center here. But wait, each of the central carbons (the ones connecting the two phenyl rings) are attached to two phenyl groups and two other substituents. Wait, in this case, each has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester group. So, for each central carbon, let's see: the substituents are two phenyl rings (but wait, the same), a nitro group, and a carboxylate group. Are any of these carbons attached to four different groups?

Wait, the central carbon (say, the one in 1,1'-biphenyl) is connected to two phenyl groups (the two benzene rings), a nitro group (NO2) on one side, and a OOCR group (carboxylate ester) on the other. So each central carbon has, perhaps, two phenyls, a nitro, and a ester group. Wait, but two of the groups are the same (the two phenyl rings connected to the same carbon). So each central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups. So, for each, the substituents are: two phenyl (same), nitro, and ester. So that's four groups but two are the same. So each central carbon has two identical groups. Thus, each can
