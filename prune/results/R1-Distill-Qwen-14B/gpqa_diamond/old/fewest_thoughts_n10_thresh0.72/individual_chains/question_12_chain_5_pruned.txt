Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Alright, let's read it carefully.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Here, Pi(+) is at rest. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of the products, which are the muon and the neutrino. The options are A to D, each giving two values, presumably the KEs of the muon and neutrino respectively.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So the vector sum of their momenta must be zero.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they are leptons and have very small (probably negligible) mass. Oh, but for the purpose of this problem, I think they're considered massless, or at least, their rest mass is negligible compared to the others. Because the muon's mass is 105.7 MeV, which is a significant fraction of the pion's mass.

So, the pion is at rest, so total energy is its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The products are the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

The total energy after decay must equal the total energy before. So, the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino should be 139.6 MeV.

Also, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the vectors of the muon and neutrino momenta must cancel each other. So, the magnitudes are equal, and their directions are opposite.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as -p (same magnitude, opposite direction). 

The energy of each particle is given by the relativistic energy formula: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But since we're working in units where c=1 (as MeV and such are in units where c is absorbed), the energy becomes E = sqrt( p² + m² ).

So, for the muon, its energy E_mu is sqrt( p² + (105.7)^2 ). For the neutrino, since its mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p.

The total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

So, sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, that equation looks a bit complicated, but I can try to solve for p.

Let me denote E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and E_nu = p.

So, equation becomes sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = M_pi.

Where M_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

Let me rearrange the equation: sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = M_pi - p.

Now, square both sides:

p² + m_mu² = (M_pi - p)^2 = M_pi² - 2 M_pi p + p².

Cancel out p² on both sides:

m_mu² = M_pi² - 2 M_pi p.

Rearranging, 2 M_pi p = M_pi² - m_mu².

So, p = (M_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 M_pi).

Let me compute that:

M_pi = 139.6 MeV.

m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

Compute numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Let me calculate 139.6 squared: 139.6 * 139.6. Hmm, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

139.6 * 139.6 = ?

Let me compute 139 * 139 first. 139 squared is 19321.

Then, 139.6 is 139 + 0.6. So, (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2.

139^2 = 19321.

2*139*0.6 = 278 *0.6 = 166.8.

0.6^2 = 0.36.

So, 19321 + 166.8 = 19487.8; +0.36 is 19488.16.

So, (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 (MeV)^2.

Similarly, (105.7)^2: Let me compute 105^2 = 11025. 0.7^2=0.49. 2*105*0.7=147. So, (105.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 (MeV)^2.

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So, p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67, so let's see: 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait, maybe I can approximate.

Alternatively, using calculator-like steps:

279.2 * x = 8315.67.

Compute x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

279.2 * 30 = 8376.

But 29.8 is 30 - 0.2. So 8376 - (279.2 * 0.2) = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.

Which is very close to 8315.67. So, x ≈ 29.8 - (4.49)/279.2 ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 =
