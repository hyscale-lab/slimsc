Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO and HIRES. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, wait. No, I think I misread. It says, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, right, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So if a star has a V magnitude less than 17, it's brighter and can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So a star's apparent V magnitude needs to be less than 16 for HIRES.

So for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude that's less than both 17 and 16. Wait, no, wait. No, each spectrograph has its own limit. So the star needs to be brighter than 17 in V for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 in V for HIRES. Wait, but that can't be, because 16 is brighter than 17. So if a star is brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17. So, the limiting factor is the more restrictive one. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than 16 to be detected by both. Because 16 < 17, so any star brighter than 16 (i.e., magnitude <16) would satisfy both.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. BecauseESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. That means it can observe any star with V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16. So any star that is brighter than 16 (V <16) can be seen by both. But a star with V=16.5 is too faint for HIRES (since HIRES can only go down to V=16), but it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But which spectrograph can detect which stars.

So the question is, which stars are observable by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be <17 for ESPRESSO, and <16 for HIRES. So the stricter condition is V <16. So the star must have V <16 to be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Because some stars might have an apparent V magnitude that's lower than 16 (brighter), so both can detect, but others may have V up to less than 17 but higher than 16, which ESPRESSO can detect, but HIRES can't. So the stars that can be detected by both must have V <16.

But wait, some stars might have their apparent magnitudes affected by extinction, which is the E(B-V) given. Oh right, so for some stars, their apparent V magnitude is affected by dust, making them appear fainter. So I need to calculate their actual apparent V magnitudes, considering extinction.

Wait, the question gives for some stars an E(B-V) and tells us to account for the total absorption in V. The formula given is that the total absorption in V is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So the extinction, Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). Because normally, Av = R * E(B-V), where R is approximately 3.1.

Apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av, where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs, and Av is the extinction. Wait, but wait, no. Because M is the absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc without any extinction. So to get the apparent magnitude m, you calculate m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av.

So, for each star, I'll compute their apparent V magnitude, considering extinction where given, and then check if it's below 16 for HIRES and below 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, because the question says that each spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 17 and 16, respectively. So a star's apparent V must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES.

So the star must have m_V <17 for ESPRESSO and m_V <16 for HIRES. So to be detected by both, it must have m_V <16.

But wait, some stars are given absolute magnitude (M) and distance, so I can compute their apparent magnitude (m) using m = M + 5 log10(d/10 pc). But if there's extinction, then m_observed = m + Av. Wait, wait, no, because extinction makes stars appear fainter, which would increase their apparent magnitude. So m_observed = m_true + Av.

Wait, because m is the apparent magnitude without extinction. So if extinction adds to the apparent magnitude, the observed m is larger. So for a star, its true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true = M + 5 log10(d/10). Then, the observed apparent magnitude m_obs = m_true + Av.

So if a star's m_obs is less than 17, it's visible to ESPRESSO, and less than 16 for HIRES.

Let's go through each star.

Star1: RA 15 deg, DEC -75, Mv=15.5, d=10 pc.

Compute m_true: m = M + 5 log10(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 log(10/10) =15.5 +0 =15.5.

Av is not given, so E(B-V) is zero. So m_obs =15.5 +0=15.5. So m_obs=15.5 <16 and <17. So this star can be detected by both. So Star1 can be seen by both.

Star2: RA30, DEC55, apparent V=16.5, d=5pc.

Wait, the apparent magnitude is given, so no need to compute. So m_obs =16.5. Now, for HIRES, requires m<16. So 16.5 is not less than 16, so HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <17. So Star2 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3: RA11h, DEC48, apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, d=15pc.

Wait, but in this case, the apparent V is given as 15.5, but that's before considering extinction. Because the question says Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So do I need to adjust the apparent magnitude for extinction? Hmm, perhaps not, because the apparent magnitude given is the observed one. Wait, no, wait. Or is the 15.5 the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction), and then I have to add the extinction to get the actual observed mag?

Wait, the question says: Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag, and E(B-V)=0.6. So I think that the given apparent V is the observed value, but that's not the case. Or perhaps the given apparent V is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the E(B-V) is given, so we need to compute the observed apparent V.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's read the question again. For Star3, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the apparent magnitude already includes extinction. Because extinction makes stars appear fainter (higher m), so if a star is at a certain distance with no extinction, its apparent magnitude would be m_true. But with extinction, m_obs = m_true + Av. So if Star3 has an apparent magnitude of 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, then we'd have to compute the Av and add it to m_true to get m_obs. But that would make m_obs = m_true + Av. Wait, but in that case, if m_obs is given as 15.5, then m_true would be 15.5 - Av. But that's probably not the case, because the given apparent V is probably the observed one.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps for Star3, the apparent V is given as the observed value, which already includes extinction. So Star3's m_obs is 15.5. Wait, but that can't be right because E(B-V) is given. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the apparent V is 15.5 without extinction, and then we have to add Av to get the observed m_obs. But that would make the observed m larger.

Wait, let me clarify. The star's intrinsic brightness (without extinction) would have an apparent magnitude m_true. But due to extinction, the observed magnitude is m_obs = m_true + Av. So in the case of Star3, the given apparent V is 15.5, which is probably the observed magnitude. So we don't need to do anything else. Or is the given apparent V the m_true, and then we have to compute m_obs by adding Av?

Wait, the question says for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag." Hmm, perhaps in this case, the 15.5 is the m_true, and then the observed m is 15.5 + Av. So I need to compute Av.

Av = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So m_obs = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 mag.

So for Star3, the observed m is 17.36. So is that right? Because that would make it too faint for both spectrographs. Because ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 17.36 is too faint. So Star3 would not be detected by either.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the given apparent V is the observed or the intrinsic. Oh wait, the question mentions Star3's location and apparent V. Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5." Hmm, but if that's the apparent magnitude as observed, then we don't need to adjust for extinction because the extinction is already accounted for in the observed magnitude. No, that's not correct. Because if a star has E(B-V)=0.6, that means the extinction is present, so the apparent magnitude is m_obs. So in that case, Star3's m_obs is 15.5, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent V is the m_true, and the observed is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the apparent V given is the m_true, and we have to compute m_obs by adding Av. Let's proceed.

So for Star3:

m_true = 15.5

Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86

m_obs = 15.5 +1.86 =17.36

So m_obs=17.36. Now, for ESPRESSO, m <17 is allowed. 17.36 >17, so not observable by ESPRESSO. HIRES requires m <16, which is way higher, so not observable. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait, but that can't be right because it's located at 15 pc, which is not too far. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent V is already the observed value, so we don't need to apply extinction. Because if the apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, that would mean that m_obs =15.5. But that would mean that the star's actual m_true is m_obs - Av =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that's complicating things, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the apparent magnitude given is the observed one, so it's already affected by extinction. So in that case, Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is less than 16. So it can be detected by both.

But that seems conflicting. Let me think again. The question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag." So perhaps they're giving the apparent magnitude without considering extinction. So in that case, the observed m is 15.5 +1.86 =17.36, which is beyond both limits.

But that would mean Star3 is not observable by either, which may not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent V is the observed one, so E(B-V) is provided, but the m_obs is given. Then, we don't need to adjust it because it's already observed. So Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is below 16, so detectable by both.

Wait, but the problem says: "For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits..." but not the effect of extinction. So perhaps we have to apply extinction to some of the stars.

Let me try to approach each star step by step.

Star1:

Absolute magnitude Mv=15.5, d=10 pc, no E(B-V) given. So E(B-V)=0.

m_true = M + 5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +5 log(1) =15.5. Av=0, so m_obs=15.5.

So m_obs=15.5 <16 and <17. So detectable by both.

Star2:

Apparent V=16.5, E(B-V)=0? Because no E(B-V) given.

Wait, the question says Star2's E(B-V) is not given, so it's zero. So m_obs =16.5.

So m_obs=16.5. For HIRES, needs m <16. So 16.5 is not acceptable. So only ESPRESSO can detect it.

Star3:

Apparent V=15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So we need to calculate Av =3.1*0.6=1.86.

Now, the question is whether the 15.5 is the apparent magnitude before or after adding extinction. If the 15.5 is the intrinsic (m_true), then m_obs=15.5 +1.86=17.36. Which is above both limits.

But if 15.5 is the observed magnitude, then the extinction would have already been applied, so Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is acceptable for both.

But that can't be right because E(B-V) is provided, implying that extinction hasn't been accounted for. So I think the correct approach is to calculate the observed m by adding Av to the intrinsic m.

Wait, but in the case of Star3, the apparent V is given as 15.5, but that's the intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude? No, because apparent magnitude is observed, including any extinction. So perhaps the given 15.5 is already the observed magnitude, so we don't need to add anything. But that would make the E(B-V) irrelevant, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and Star3's apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, so we have to compute m_obs.

But I'm getting stuck on this. Let me proceed to other stars and see.

Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48, Mv=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, d=10 pc.

Compute m_true: M=15.5, d=10. So m_true=15.5 +5 log(10/10) =15.5. Av=3.1*0.4=1.24. So m_obs=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m_obs=16.74. That's above both 16 and 17? Wait, 16.74>17? No, 16.74 is less than 17? Wait, 17 is higher than 16.74. Wait, no, 16.74 is 16.74, which is less than 17. So m_obs=16.74 <17. So ESPRESSO can detect it. But for HIRES, which requires m <16, 16.74>16, so HIRES can't detect it. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, Mv=16.5, d=5 pc.

Compute m_true: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m_true=16.5 +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) ≈16.5 -1.505=14.995≈15.0.

E(B-V) is not given, so Av=0. So m_obs=15.0.

So m_obs=15.0 <16 and <17, so detectable by both.

Wait, but let me double-check:

m_true = M +5 log10(d/10) =16.5 +5 log(5/10)=16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5-1.505≈14.995, which is approximately 15.0.

So m_obs=15.0, so yes, can be detected by both.

Wait, but Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, and distance is 5 pc. So without distance modulus, the m_true is 15.0, which is correct.

So now, let's list which stars can be detected by both.

Star1: m_obs=15.5 → both.

Star2: m_obs=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: If 15.5 is m_true, then m_obs=17.36 → cannot be detected by either.

Alternatively, if m_obs is 15.5, which is lower than 16, so can be detected by both. But I'm not sure. The question is unclear here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star3's approach. Let's re-express:

Star3's parameters:

- M_v is not given. It has apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So I'm not sure how to proceed. Because without knowing the absolute magnitude and distance, I can't compute the intrinsic m_true. Wait, wait, no, Star3's parameters are: apparent V magnitude 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, and located at 15 pc.

Wait a minute! That's a problem. Because if a star's apparent magnitude is given as m_obs, which includes extinction, then you can't compute its absolute magnitude unless you know the distance modulus and Av.

But in this case, Star3's given apparent magnitude is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, and distance is 15 pc.

Wait, but that's not possible. Because the apparent magnitude includes extinction, so the formula is m_obs = M +5 log10(d/10) + Av.

So let me compute Star3's M.

Wait, m_obs is given as 15.5, and we have d=15 pc, E(B-V)=0.6.

Av=3.1 * 0.6=1.86.

So,

m_obs = M +5 log10(15/10) +1.86.

So,

15.5 = M +5 log(1.5) +1.86.

log(1.5) ≈0.1761.

So,

15.5 = M +5*(0.1761) +1.86 → M +0.8805 +1.86 = M +2.7405.

So, M =15.5 -2.7405 =12.7595≈12.76.

So, the absolute magnitude M is about12.76. But that's not necessary for the question. Wait, but the point is, the m_obs is given as 15.5, which already accounts for Av. So perhaps Star3's m_obs is 15.5, and the E(B-V) is provided but not needed because the apparent magnitude is already observed.

In that case, Star3's m_obs=15.5, which is <16 and <17. So it can be detected by both spectrographs.

But that seems conflicting with the approach I took earlier. So perhaps I need to think again.

Wait, so for Star3: given m_obs=15.5. So regardless of E(B-V), because m_obs includes extinction, the m_obs is 15.5. So it can be detected by both.

Wait, but the presence of E(B-V) suggests that extinction is present, so m_obs is higher than m_true. So if m_obs is 15.5, then m_true is lower than that. But in any case, m_obs is 15.5, so it's within both limits.

Hmm, but I'm getting conflicting information because I'm not sure whether the given apparent magnitude already includes extinction or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the apparent magnitudes given for the stars (like Star3 and Star4) are the intrinsic (without extinction), so we have to compute the observed m by adding Av.

In that case, for Star3:

m_true =15.5.

Av=1.86.

m_obs=15.5+1.86=17.36.

Which is beyond both limits, so not detectable.

But that's a problem because Star3's m_obs would then be too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude for Star3 is the observed one, so m_obs=15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6 is provided but doesn't affect the outcome because the m_obs is already given. So the answer for Star3 would be that it can be detected by both.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think about the other stars.

Star5: as computed earlier, m_obs=15.0. So detectable by both.

So now, let's go through each star:

Star1: m=15.5 → both.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: if m_obs=15.5 → both; else, if m_obs=17.36 → neither.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5: m_obs=15 → both.

So which stars can be detected by both?

Star1 and Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but the options don't include all three. Let me check the options:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, according to my analysis, Star1, Star3 (if m_obs=15.5), and Star5 are detectable by both.

Wait, but Star3's situation is ambiguous. Let me re-express:

If the given apparent magnitude for Star3 is the observed (m_obs), then Star3 can be detected by both. But if it's the intrinsic (m_true), then Star3's m_obs is 17.36 → not detectable.

But the question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." So in this case, without E(B-V), the m_obs would be m_true = M +5 log(d/10). But since M isn't given, perhaps the given 15.5 is m_obs without considering E(B-V). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, so we have to compute the observed m.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the given 15.5 is the apparent magnitude, which already includes the extinction. So Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is acceptable for both spectrographs.

In that case, which stars can be detected by both:

Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), Star5 (15.0).

So let's see the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → yes, both can be detected by both.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be detected, Star4's m_obs=16.74, which is above 16, so only ESPRESSO can see it. So D is incorrect.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both → seems correct.

But wait, Star1's m_obs is 15.5, which is also acceptable. So why isn't Star1 included in any option? Option D includes Star1 and Star4, but Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star3's calculation. Let me re-express.

Wait, Star3's parameters:

- RA=11h, DEC=48, apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, d=15 pc.

Assuming that the given apparent magnitude is intrinsic (m_true) and not the observed, then:

Av=3.1 * 0.6=1.86.

m_obs = m_true + Av =15.5 +1.86=17.36 → which is above both 16 and 17, so can't be seen by either.

Thus, Star3's m_obs=17.36 → not detectable by either.

In that case, which stars can be detected by both?

Star1: m_obs=15.5 → both.

Star5: m_obs=15.0 → both.

So Star1 and Star5 are detectable by both. But looking at the options, none of the options have both Star1 and Star5. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m_obs=16.74 → only ESPRESSO, so A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't be detected, so B is incorrect.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES, so C is incorrect.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be detected by both, Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, so D is incorrect.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude for Star3 is the observed one, so m_obs=15.5 → can be detected by both.

In that case, the stars detectable by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), and Star5 (15.0).

Looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

So the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

But wait, let's double-check Star5:

Star5's m_obs=15.0 → yes, both.

Star3's m_obs=15.5 → both.

So option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star1's m_obs=15.5, which is also acceptable. But according to the options, only option B includes two stars detectable by both.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

But I'm getting a bit confused because Star1's m_obs is 15.5, which is acceptable by both, but it's not part of any option except option D (which also includes Star4, which isn't acceptable).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star1's calculation. Let me recheck.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc, no extinction.

m_true =15.5 +5 log(10/10)=15.5.

m_obs=15.5.

So yes, detectable by both.

So Star1 is detectable by both.

But according to the options, the only option that includes two stars detectable by both is option B (Star3 and Star5) and option D (Star1 and Star4).

Wait, but Star4's m_obs is 16.74, which is above 16, so only ESPRESSO can detect it.

So the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3 (if m_obs=15.5), and Star5.

But looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → correct.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct answer would be option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze each star's apparent V magnitude ($m_{\text{obs}}$), considering the given limits: ESPRESSO can observe stars with $m_{\text{obs}} < 17$, while HIRES requires $m_{\text{obs}} < 16$. Stars must satisfy both conditions to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Key Calculations and Analysis

#### **Star1**
- **Parameters**: $M_V = 15.5$, $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$, $E(B-V) = 0$.
- **Calculation**:  
  $m_{\text{true}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5$.  
  Since $E(B-V) = 0$, $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 0$.  
  $m_{\text{obs}} = m_{\text{true}} + A_V = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5$.
- **Conclusion**: $m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 < 16$ and $15.5 < 17$, so **Star1** is detectable by both spectrographs.

#### **Star2**
- **Parameters**: Apparent $V$ magnitude $m_{\text{obs}} = 16.5$, $E(B-V) = 0$.
- **Conclusion**: $m_{\text{obs}} = 16.5 > 16$, so **Star2** is detectable only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star3**
- **Parameters**: Apparent $V$ magnitude $m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5$, $E(B-V) = 0.6$, $d = 15 \, \text{pc}$.
- **Calculation**:  
  $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86$.  
  The apparent magnitude $m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5$ already includes extinction, so no adjustment is needed.
- **Conclusion**: $m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 < 16$ and $15.5 < 17$, so **Star3** is detectable by both spectrographs.

#### **Star4**
- **Parameters**: $M_V = 15.5$, $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$, $E(B-V) = 0.4$.
- **Calculation**:  
  $m_{\text{true}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5$.  
  $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24$.  
  $m_{\text{obs}} = m_{\text{true}} + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74$.
- **Conclusion**: $m_{\text{obs}} = 16.74 > 16$, so **Star4** is detectable only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star5**
- **Parameters**: $M_V = 16.5$, $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$, $E(B-V) = 0$.
- **Calculation**:  
  $m_{\text{true}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0$.  
  Since $E(B-V) = 0$, $A_V = 0$.  
  $m_{\text{obs}} = m_{\text{true}} + A_V = 15.0 + 0 = 15.0$.
- **Conclusion**: $m_{\text{obs}} = 15.0 < 16$ and $15.0 < 17$, so **Star5** is detectable by both spectrographs.

### Final Answer
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** and **Star5**.
