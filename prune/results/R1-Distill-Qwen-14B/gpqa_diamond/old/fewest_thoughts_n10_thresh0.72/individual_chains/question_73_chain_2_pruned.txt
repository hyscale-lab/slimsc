Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

So the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the speeds normally because that would be incorrect. I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the velocity addition formula for two objects moving in the same direction. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, since both are in the same direction, the relative speed would be how much faster one is than the other. So for the velocity of the first astronaut relative to the second, it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c^2)).

Wait, actually, let me get this straight. If astronaut A is moving at v1 and astronaut B at v2 (both same direction), then the relative speed u of A as seen from B is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

So plugging in the numbers: v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

So u = (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2)].

Calculating numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c, so that's a clue.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Wait, the system's total energy would be the sum of the energies of both astronauts. Because energy is additive in inertial frames.

Each astronaut's relativistic energy is
