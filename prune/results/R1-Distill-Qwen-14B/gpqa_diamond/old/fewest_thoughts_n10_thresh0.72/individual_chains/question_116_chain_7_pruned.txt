Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let me read through the question carefully.

So, the problem starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is split into two by neighboring groups. Wait, no, wait: the splitting is determined by the neighboring protons. Oh right, the number of neighboring protons plus one gives the split. So a quartet would be next to a group with three protons, because 3+1=4. Similarly, a triplet is next to a group with two protons (2+1=3).

But wait, looking at the integrals: 6H and 4H. So the triplet has 6H and quartet 4H. Let me think about what structures would give that. Maybe it's a di-substituted alkane. For instance, maybe a structure like two -CH2CH3 groups attached to a central CH2.

Wait, if the triplet is for 6H, that suggests three sets of 2H each? Or maybe each of two CH3 groups. Let me think. If the quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm is typically a CH3 group next to a CH2 group. So 0.9 is where CH3 usually is. And a quartet at 1.3 ppm is another CH2 group. So maybe the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CH2â€” but wait, that's not possible because (CH2CH3)2CH2 would be a four-carbon chain: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, maybe it's a more branched structure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is two ethyl groups attached to a central CH2 group. So like CH2CH2(C H2CH3)2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a neopentyl-type structure? Or perhaps a diethyl ether? No, because diethyl ether would have different splitting. Wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the quartet is at 1.3 ppm and is 4H, that's probably a CH2 group next to another CH2. Because the quartet implies three neighboring protons. Wait, no. Wait, the quartet would be a group with two neighboring protons. Because a quartet is n=3, so the neighboring group has three protons. Wait, okay, let me get this straight. The splitting rule is the number of neighboring protons plus one. So if a proton is split into a quartet, that means it's next to a group with three protons. So which group has three protons? A CH3 group, right? Because each proton in the quartet is next to three Hs on the CH3.

So the quartet (4H) is likely from a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3. And the triplet (6H) would be from two CH
