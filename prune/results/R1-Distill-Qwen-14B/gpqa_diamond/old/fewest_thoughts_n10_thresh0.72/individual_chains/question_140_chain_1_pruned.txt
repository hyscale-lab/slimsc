Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and another product B. There are a few clues here that I should unpack.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Hmm, so X must be a compound where one of its elements has an isotope with a higher atomic mass. Common elements with isotopes used in such reactions could be chlorine (has Cl-35 and Cl-37), bromine, or maybe something else.

When X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That's interesting. So for W, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think: which gases fit that? Well, water is H2O, but that's not a gas with equal protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe it's something like CO2? No, CO2 has 12 + 16*2 = 44 g/mol, but wait, the molecule. Wait, the molecule itself has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's see, for each molecule.

Wait, what's a common gas that's a product of such reactions? Like when metals react with acids, they produce hydrogen gas. But H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons? No, hydrogen has one proton and one neutron if it's deuterium. Wait, but H2 normally has two H atoms each with one proton and zero neutrons (protium). So each H has one proton, so H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons per molecule? That doesn't fit. So maybe another gas.

What about CO2? Let's see: CO2 molecule has C (6 protons) and two O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 =22. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (since C-12 is most common), each O has 8 (O-16). So total neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. Oh wait, that's the same as protons. So CO2 would fit. But wait, when would X react with Y to produce CO2? Maybe if Y
