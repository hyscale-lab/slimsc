Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I need to find Z, the partition function, which is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE). Oh wait, right, beta is 1/(kT), but I don't need to worry about the actual value, just keep it as β.

So the system has three spins. Each spin has two possible states, so the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. I need to list all possible states and compute E for each, then sum e^(-βE) for all.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than brute-forcing all 8 possibilities. Let me think about the symmetry here. The energy depends on the products S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3. Each product can be +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are the same or opposite.

Alternatively, maybe I can categorize the states based on the number of neighboring pairs that are aligned.

Wait, but for three spins, each pair is S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. So the total energy is -J times the sum of these three terms. Let me compute E as -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3?

Wait, let me think: each of the three terms contributes either +1 or -1. So the sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1 and one -1), -1 (two -1 and one +1), or -3 (all -1). So E would be -J times that sum, so E can be -3J, -J, J, 3J.

Wait, no. Wait, the sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me take a specific example. Suppose all spins are up: S1=S2=S3=+1. Then each product is +1, sum
