Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and we need to identify what Compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm, okay. First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used reagent in the opening of epoxides. Oh right! It's a base, often used to deprotonate epoxides in ring-opening reactions. So if the reaction is between compound X and this reagent, I suspect that X might be an epoxide. Because when an epoxide reacts with a base like this, it undergoes ring-opening.

Wait, but if the product is the result of the reaction, what does that mean for X? Oh, wait no. The reaction is between X and this reagent. But if X is an epoxide, the reagent would open it. But the question is about the identity of X, not the product. So maybe I should think about the product's structure and work backwards to find X.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxide formation. Wait, no. Epoxidation usually involves things like peracids. But the reagent here is a diamine bicyclic compound. Oh, right! 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used in the opening of epoxides, especially in acid-catalyzed conditions. Or wait, maybe in some other contexts. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if the reaction is the opening of an epoxide, then the product would be a diol. But looking at the NMR data, let's see what the product might be.

Let me look at the 1H NMR data:
