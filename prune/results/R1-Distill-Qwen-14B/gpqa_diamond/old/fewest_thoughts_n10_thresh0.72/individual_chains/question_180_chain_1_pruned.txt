Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The system is isolated, so I guess I don't have to worry about external fields or anything. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P, and the thirteenth charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system. Wait, minimum energyâ€”oh, right, that probably means the potential energy is minimized because for a system of charges, potential energy can vary based on their arrangement, but since some are fixed, maybe the minimum is when they're arranged in the most stable way. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

So, each charge is 2e, so the charge per particle is 2 times the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C. 

The setup: 12 charges are at 2 m from point P, and one is at P. So the charge at P is fixed, and the others are at a fixed distance from it. I think the potential energy of the system comes from the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P.

Wait, but the 12 are all
