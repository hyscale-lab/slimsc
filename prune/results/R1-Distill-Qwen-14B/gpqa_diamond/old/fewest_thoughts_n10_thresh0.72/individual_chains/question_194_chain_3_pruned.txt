Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let me think. So, the question is about three spins S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Oh wait, no—wait, actually, the partition function Z is the sum of exp(-β E_i) for each state i. But β is 1/(k T), so yeah, that's correct.

So each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1. I need to calculate E for each state and then sum exp(-β E) for each.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 possibilities. Since the energy is symmetric in all pairs, perhaps I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 and find how many states have each sum.

Let me think: each term S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same, -1 if different. So each S_i S_j is ±1. So the sum of three terms can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

Wait, let me compute all possible sums. Let's see:

Case 1: All three pairs are +1. That would happen when all spins are same. So S1=S2=S3=+1 or all =-1. Then each S_i S_j=1, so sum is 3. How many such states? Two, because all same can be + or -.

Case 2: Two pairs are +1, one pair is -1. Wait, but wait, let's see—if two pairs are +1, what does that imply about the spins?

Suppose S1=S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. Hmm
