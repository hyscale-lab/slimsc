Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². So I remember that the isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator is a standard problem, right?

The question is asking two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm. I think I need to break this down step by step.

First, I should probably recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. From what I remember, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, in three dimensions, the energy is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, I think there's another expression where the energy is expressed in terms of a total quantum number. Oh right, sometimes it's written as E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So n is the sum of the three quantum numbers.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The energy levels in a 3D harmonic oscillator are equally spaced when you consider the sum of the quantum numbers. So each energy level corresponds to a certain value of n, which is the sum of the three individual quantum numbers (n_x, n_y, n_z). For example, the ground state is when all three are zero, so n=0, and E = (3/2) ħω.

Now, excited states come when we increase n. The first excited state would be the lowest n=1, but wait, that might not be the case. Wait, no. Because the energy depends on the sum, the first excited state could have any one of the three quantum numbers equal to 1, and the others zero. But the next states would include higher sums. So the order of states is by the value of n.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the states ordered by their energy. The ground state is n=0, E= (3/2) ħω. The first excited state is n=1, E= (5/2
