Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking. 

We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in this solution. 

I remember that orthophosphate is the conjugate base of HPO₄²⁻, which comes from H₂PO₄⁻. The relevant Ka values for H₃PO₄ are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

Wait, so H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps:
1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4⁻ (Ka1)
2. H2PO4⁻ ↔ H+ + HPO4²⁻ (Ka2)
3. HPO4²⁻ ↔ H+ + PO4³⁻ (Ka3)

But in this problem, we have K hydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4·2H2O). Let me think about what these salts dissociate into.

KH₂PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4⁻. So adding this salt increases the concentration of H2PO4⁻ ions in solution.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4²⁻. So this adds HPO4²⁻ ions to the solution.

Wait a minute, but the problem is about orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻). So how do we get PO4³⁻ from HPO4²⁻? Well, because HPO4²⁻ can lose another proton to become PO4³⁻, but that's the third dissociation step. The problem is whether this is significant in solution.

Given the concentrations of the salt and the solution, perhaps there's a buffer system here. Since we have both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, maybe the solution is a buffer. But wait, the question is about PO4³⁻, which is the deprotonated form of HPO4²⁻. So HPO4²⁻ can donate a proton to become PO4³⁻, but the Ka for that is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. That's a very small value, meaning that HPO4²⁻ is a very weak acid and doesn't release many protons. So the concentration of PO4³⁻ would be very low.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the solution isn't just a simple
