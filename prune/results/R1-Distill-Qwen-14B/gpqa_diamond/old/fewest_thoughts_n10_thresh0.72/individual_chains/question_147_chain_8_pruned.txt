Okay, so I'm faced with this physics problem about annihilation. Hmm, I remember that annihilation involves particles and their antiparticles, right? Like protons and antiprotons annihilating each other. The question here is about the process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Interesting. 

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so if it's slowly moving, maybe its kinetic energy is low compared to its rest mass energy? Because if it's moving slowly, its gamma factor (Lorentz factor) would be close to 1, right? So perhaps we can treat it as non-relativistic? Or maybe not, but I'll have to see.

The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. I'm supposed to find the velocity of particle A. The options are in terms of c, so I'll need to compute beta (v/c), I think.

Let me think about conservation laws here. Since the system is isolated, both energy and momentum should be conserved. But wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about their rest masses. The proton mass is about 938 MeV/c². So the antiproton would have the same mass, right? So the initial total energy would be the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy. So maybe the initial energy is approximately 2 * 938 MeV, which is 1876 MeV, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, no, because the proton is stationary? Or is it the antiproton that's moving slowly? The problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. So the initial setup: proton is probably at rest (because if the antiproton is moving towards it, maybe the proton is stationary). Or perhaps the proton is moving? Hmm, the question isn't clear. Wait, wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the initial momentum comes only from the antiproton.

Wait, the initial system is p + p̄. Let's model this as the proton being at rest (because if the antiproton is moving, it's the only one contributing to the initial momentum). So the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. But since the antiproton is moving slowly,
