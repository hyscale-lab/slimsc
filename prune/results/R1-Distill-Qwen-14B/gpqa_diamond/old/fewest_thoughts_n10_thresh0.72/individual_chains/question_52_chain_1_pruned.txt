Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and see what it's about. 

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”no spots versus when it has spots.

Hmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of populations in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. Because spots are cooler regions, so when the star has spots, the average Teff drops. 

So the question is about how the ratio n_level1 / n_level2 changes when the temperature changes. Let me think: the ratio would be (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). 

Wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Let me call them level 1 and level 2. So when the star has no spots, Teff is 6000 K, and when it has spots, 5500 K. 

Wait, but the presence of spots would cover part of the surface, but does the photosphere's temperature change uniformly? Oh, the question says when 40% is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K. So the effective temperature of the entire star is lower. So from 600
