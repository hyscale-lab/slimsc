Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about quantum mechanics and matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my linear algebra and quantum stuff, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix, right? And there are four options, A to D. I need to pick the correct statement based on these matrices.

Let me try to understand each part. The question is about quantum mechanics and matrices, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Also, the evolution operator is a unitary matrix, and it's usually of the form e^(-iHt/ħ), where H is Hermitian. Oh wait, but the actual form can vary based on the convention, but the key properties are unitarity and being the exponential of some Hermitian matrix.

So, let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, for this to be true, e^X must not be unitary. Because if a matrix is unitary, multiplying a vector by it preserves the norm. So if e^X is not unitary, then there exists a vector where the norm changes.

So I need to check if X is a Hermitian matrix. Because the exponential of a Hermitian matrix is unitary. Because for a Hermitian H, e^(-iH) is unitary. Wait, but here it's e^X, not e^{iX}.

Wait, but for X to make e^X unitary, X needs to be skew-Hermitian. Because if X is skew-Hermitian (i.e., X† = -X), then e^X is unitary. Because (e^X)† = e^{X†} = e^{-X} = inverse of e^X, so it's unitary.

So first, I need to check if matrix X is Hermitian or skew-Hermitian.

X is given as:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3:
